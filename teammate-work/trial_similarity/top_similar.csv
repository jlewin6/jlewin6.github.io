NCT00547950,"In order to observe the influence of the Dengzhan Shengmai Capsule on the endpoint of patients with ischemic stroke, we hold the multi-centered prospective cohort study. From November 2007 to December 2009, 12000 subjects are included in 200 clinical research centers all over China. The subjects naturally formed two cohorts based on taking Dengzhan Shengmai capsule or not. The basic therapy included antiplatelet aggregation , stroke health education, management of blood pressure, blood lipid and blood glucose, etc. Then all of the subjects are visited on the 360th day after inclusion. The recurrence of stroke, cardiovascular events, and peripheral arterial events are observed.",0.5053

NCT05277311,"The aim of the study is to determine if LongShengZhi Capsule is effective and safe in patients with ischemic stroke in comparison to placebo. This trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel-group, superiority trial.",0.1685

NCT02537652,"Individuals who experience a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) are at heightened risk of subsequent vascular events, including heart attacks and secondary stroke/TIA. Blood pressure control is considered the most important contributor to positive health outcomes in stroke patients. The measurement of central blood pressure (cSBP) (the blood pressure which is being exerted at the heart), may provide clinicians with important diagnostic and prognostic information over and above that typically obtained from a peripheral blood pressure measure (the blood pressure in the arm). Central blood pressures may be better than traditional peripheral blood pressure measures as: i) peripheral blood pressure may not accurately reflect the effects of peak arterial blood pressure on centrally located organs, ii) central blood pressures may be 50 % superior to peripheral blood pressures when predicting cardiovascular events, and iii) information pertaining to central blood pressures may be more effective in the management of hypertension. While the validity of oscillometric devices which measure central blood pressures has been demonstrated, further study is required to determine precision under normal clinical operating conditions (i.e., reflective of the Hospital/GP practice setting). As such, this study will assess central and peripheral blood pressures of stroke patients when fasted and nonfasted, and when seated and supine. The study is interested in identifying the effect of the above parameters (fasted vs. unfasted, seated vs. supine) on central and peripheral blood pressures in stroke patients.

Participants will take part in three separate assessment sessions, on three separate days, with a minimum 24 hour recovery between each session. Each assessment is expected to last 90 minutes, with a minimum of eight blood pressures being taken from the left upper arm. As such, participants will be asked to give up 4.5 hours of their time to the study. During each assessment participants will be tested in a fasted and non-fasted state, and in a supine (lying) and seated position. All assessments will take place between 7 and 10am and will be undertaken following written informed consent.",0.1637
