NCT00334230,"This study, conducted in collaboration with the National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH) in Washington, D.C., will look at changes in brain activation and brain responses that occur with gait (walking) training. Brain images and responses of healthy subjects are compared with those of patients.

Healthy normal volunteers and people who have had a stroke within 3 months of starting the study may be eligible for this study. Candidates must be between 18 and 80 years of age, and patients must participate in NRH's walking study.

Stroke patients participate in all three study sessions described below. The first session takes place before patients start the NRH walking training study, the second session takes place at completion of the NRH walking study, and the third session takes place 3 months after completing the NRH study. Healthy control subjects complete only the procedures in session 3.

Session 1

Day 1: Neurological examination and questionnaire to evaluate memory and attention.

Day 2: Motor testing with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). For this test, a wire coil is held on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current passes through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During the stimulation, the subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions to help position the coil properly. The stimulation may cause a twitch in the leg muscles, and the subject may hear a click and feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil.

Session 2

Day 1: Functional MRI (fMRI). MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. The subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner (a narrow cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most scans lasting 45 and 90 minutes. Subjects may be asked to lie still for up to a few minutes at a time and to perform movements of their foot.

Day 2: motor testing with TMS.

Session 3

NCT00561405,"Stroke is a major cause of disability in Canadian adults. Following a stroke, many people have difficulty walking in their home and in the community. The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of two different approaches to walking retraining in people who have had a stroke.

Individuals living in the community who have had recently had a stroke will be asked to participate in this study. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two five week walking training programs. In one program, individuals will re-learn to walk in a variety of real-life situations. Practice sessions will encourage active problem solving by the participants. The other program will have participants practice walking on a treadmill while some of their body weight is supported by a special harness system. Participants will also be assisted by a physiotherapist to walk in a more normal manner.

Participants' will be assessed at the beginning of the study, after the 5 week training program and again, eight weeks later. The research assistant will assess their ability to walk, their confidence level and the average daily walking activity.

Primary Hypothesis: Individuals assigned to the Motor Learning Walking Program will improve their walking ability from baseline to follow up assessment significantly more than individuals assigned to the Treadmill Training Program.

NCT04839887,"Despite a generally favourable 3-month functional outcome and a very low mortality, young ischemic stroke (IS) patients face to reduced quality of life associated with a complexity of problems or ""invisible dysfunctions"" after IS. Better identification and understanding to these factors may improve stroke rehabilitation and stroke self-management programmes, wich will lead to better stroke recovery. The aim of the study is to assess the predictors of the health-related quality of life in young patients under 50 years after ischemic stroke, and to to evaluate specific changes in different dimensions of health-related quality of life during the first year of post-stroke recovery using a standardized battery of neuropsychological tools and stroke specific health-related quality of life measures. In the first phase of the study, 300 IS patients will be enrolled for the validation of the Czech version of the the Stroke Impact Scale 3.0. In the second phase of study, 200 enrolled IS patients (100 young IS patients < 50 years and 100 IS patients of 50-65 years) will undergo a serial of structured and standardized questionnaires during scheduled outpatients' controls three, six and 12 months after IS.

NCT00646217,"Most stroke survivors return home, where their care is supported by family and friends. Although family caring at home is usually rewarding, it is often challenging, too. The demands and responsibilities of caring for a loved one at home can be stressful. The actual activities of caregiving vary according to the needs of the stroke survivor, but can include helping with bathing, dressing, eating, and many other activities. Caregivers must learn care techniques and how to manage changes in roles and lifestyle. While adjusting to these changes, caregivers may be advised to 'take care' of themselves, but may not receive guidance or support for doing this. In this study, we are testing a self-care intervention for older, spouse caregivers of persons with stroke to see how helpful the intervention is in reducing distress and in helping caregivers adopt and maintain healthy lifestyle behaviors.

We have developed an intervention for caregivers that is called Self-Care TALK. The intervention includes creating a health-promoting, self-care education and support partnership between caregivers and nurses through the use of weekly telephone conversations. Each conversation focuses on a health-related topic, such as: healthy habits, building self-esteem, focusing on the positive, avoiding role overload, communicating, and building meaning. The conversations follow a basic format, but also are unique to each person. Participants complete questionnaires before and after the intervention, so that we can test the effect of participation in Self-Care TALK on caregiver health.

We know that education and support about self-care can be achieved through partnerships between family caregivers and health care professionals. Our goal is to build on this knowledge in testing whether participation in the Self-Care TALK intervention will result in less distress and better health and well-being for spouse caregivers, compared to caregivers who receive no additional care beyond usual education and support. In working toward this goal, we are using a partnership approach, in which nurses and caregivers discuss several health-related topics and mutually identify creative solutions for caregivers to incorporate self-care and health-promotion strategies into their daily routines. Promoting healthy outcomes for caregivers is essential to supporting their personal well-being, and to fostering their ability to continue home care for their loved one."

NCT00783913,"This study will determine if electrical brain stimulation during movement practice can improve the ability of stroke patients to reach for objects more than movement practice alone.

People between 18 and 85 years old who have had a stroke may be eligible for this study. Participants are randomly assigned to one of two study groups: movement training with active (tDCS) or movement training with sham (tDCS).

Participants will undergo 1-hour movement training and (tDCS) sessions twice a day, 5 days a week, for 3 weeks. For these sessions, subjects will sit in front of a computer screen that shows a target (round dots) and a cursor (a line). Participants will be instructed to move the cursor to various targets on the computer screen as fast and as accurately as possible, controlling the position of the cursor by moving their arm, which will rest on a mechanical device.

Participants will receive real or sham (tDCS) during the movement training sessions. For (tDCS), electrode sponges soaked in tap water are placed on the scalp and forehead. A small electrical current is passed between the electrodes. The stimulation lasts 20 minutes.

Patients will have the following tests four times during the study - 1) before starting movement training 2) (tDCS) during the course of training and (tDCS), 3) after completing training and (tDCS), 4) and 3 months after completing training and (tDCS):

NCT00832351,"Treatment in stroke units compared with treatment in general medical wards reduces the odds of being dead or disabled. Little is known about which components of acute stroke care that is responsible for this benefit.

Early mobilisation is one of the features of stroke unit care. In Scandinavia, any intervention aimed to reduce the time to the first out of bed episode has been focused in order to prevent complications.

However, therapeutic interventions for cerebral revascularisation and a more intensive unit approach for observation may postpone mobilisation. The aim of the present study is to identify whether early mobilisation (< 24 hours after admittance to hospital)reduce disability and mortality compared with mobilisation after 24 hours.

The study is a prospective, randomised controlled study with blinded assessment at the end of follow up. Patients admitted to the Stroke Unit, Akershus University Hospital less than 24 hours after stroke during 2009 - 2011 are screened for recruitment. Patients are randomly assigned to either mobilisation out of bed within 24 hours from admittance to hospital or mobilisation after 24 hours. Except early contra late mobilisation all patients receive standard stroke unit care.

Patients with modified Rankin Scale 0 and 1, patients with a secondary intracerebral hemorrhage, patients receiving thrombolysis or patients requiring palliative care are excluded.

All patients are assessed at admittance, discharge and 3 months poststroke. Investigations at admittance include standard blood sample, CT/MRI scan, EKG and ultrasound of carotid arteries.

Main outcome is mortality and disability 3 months poststroke. Secondary outcome measures are neurological deficits (NIH), morbidity, complications, cognitive function reflected by Mini Mental State Examination and emotional function (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale) .

Results from this study may add important knowledge about how and when to start mobilisation of patients with acute stroke."

NCT04241848,"Veterans who suffer strokes often have disturbances in the ability to walk that reduces independence and quality of life. Alterations in gait combined with general decreased activity are associated with reduced muscle strength of the paretic leg. This leads to cardiovascular deconditioning and reduced quality of life. There is a new and novel battery powered device (Keeogo powered orthotic exoskeleton) that uses motors that assist knee movement while walking, sitting down, and standing up. The Keeogo monitors hip movement to assist the knee, making it simple to learn how to use. If successful, this project will show how this device will help improve the ability to walk and provide evidence to support larger clinical trials in a home and community setting to improve mobility, increase muscle mass and strength in the legs, as well as improve general health and quality of life. Lastly, this device could be used to increase motivation and confidence in a person to walk for longer periods of time and distance, providing the ability to walk in places that were previously inaccessible."

NCT05524727,"In Switzerland, approximately 20'000 persons suffer a stroke each year. Despite carefully considered rehabilitation programs, full recovery is achieved only in a small proportion of stroke survivors (www.swissheart.ch). Studies suggest that motor-cognitive trainings can improve gait, balance, and mobility in chronic stoke survivors. However, little is known about the effect of motor-cognitive trainings on cognitive functioning in chronic stroke.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of a motor-cognitive training added to usual care compared to usual care alone on cognitive functions, single- and dual-task mobility, gait and health-related quality of life.

In this single-blind RCT, 38 participants will be allocated randomly to either the intervention group (usual care + motor-cognitive training by means of an exergame for 12 weeks, 2x/week for 30-40 minutes) or the control group (usual care only). Both groups will attend three assessments, at baseline, post-intervention (12 weeks after baseline), and at follow-up (24 weeks after baseline). Global cognitive functioning will be the primary endpoint and a linear mixed model will be used for analysis.

Motor-cognitive trainings, especially exergames, bear the potential for further development of innovative long-term rehabilitation solutions for chronic stroke survivors. Cognitive deficits are a common unmet need restricting daily activities mentioned by chronic stroke survivors. Exergame training following personally tailored progression to generate optimal training load may help addressing this unmet need. Therefore, this study will contribute to the on-going research objective on how to improve the long-term care of stroke patients."

NCT05263804,"Ischemic stroke is the first cause of acquired disability of the adult, the second cause of dementia and the third cause of death in the industrialized countries, what constitutes à major public health issue. Stroke is characterized by a cerebral parenchymal lesion due to an ischemic mechanism (85% of the cases) or hemorrhagic mechanism (15%). For a long time, the only approved treatment was the intravenous thrombolysis (rt-PA). Recently, thrombectomy has proven its superiority in this pathology.

Cohorts of patients with stroke are rare but can be very valuable by their clinical, laboratory and imaging well documented. They are the source of new hypotheses for research or interventions as well as the quality of care assessment tool.

The main objective of this project is to identify new markers: biological and imaging, treatment response and prognosis after ischemic stroke.

Secondary objectives of the HIBISCUS-STROKE II cohort are to establish a clinical database, completed by biological samples and by imaging data that can be used in the following areas:

Descriptive epidemiology of ischemic stroke and cerebral reperfusion, Pharmacoepidemiology and treatments observatory: safety, efficacy, indication of treatment in real life, costs Assessment of the long-term effect of the treatment on the occurrence of disability, stroke recurrence and death, Quality of life and personal, familial, professional and social consequences of stroke, Research of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, Research projects.

Ancillary study :

Cardiac complications are the second leading cause of death after stroke. A close relationship between brain damage and heart complications, referred to as ""neuro-cardiac syndrome"" has been established. 20% of patients admitted for ischemic stroke present at least one major cardiac event, including acute coronary syndrome, heart failure and / or cardiac arrhythmia, within three months of the event, while 28% have a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50%. However, the underlying pathological mechanisms remain unclear and the therapeutic targets unknown. To study these mechanisms, an ancillary study will be proposed to patient whom accepted to participate in the main project research.

The general objective of the ancillary study is to identify early markers of cardiac damage during ischemic stroke having benefited from mechanical recanalization by thrombectomy, and to improve the understanding of the pathophysiology at the origin of cardiac complications in the course of an ischemic stroke with the final objective of identifying new therapeutic targets."

NCT00283881,"This study will determine if stimulation of the stroke-injured side of the brain combined with stimulation to the paralyzed hand can temporarily improve the sense of touch in stroke patients.

Healthy normal volunteers and people who have had a single stroke within 3 months of entering the study that affected one side of the brain may be eligible for this study. All participants must be between 18 and 90 years old and must be right-handed. Candidates are screened with a medical history, neurological examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain if one has not been done within 1 year of entering the study.

Participants undergo the following tests and procedures during four 2-day sessions over about 6 weeks:

Peripheral high-frequency stimulation: Small loudspeakers are taped to the fingertips and simple tactile pulses are passed through the skin. Stimulation may be sham or real.
Transcranial direct current stimulation: Two small rubber electrodes are taped to the head - one above the eye and the other on the back of the head. A current is passed between the two electrodes. Stimulation may be sham or real.
MRI: The subject lies in the scanner, a metal cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field, for about 40 minutes, lying still for up to 40 minutes at a time. An electrical stimulation is applied to the fingers of the right and left hand in separate sessions. Earplugs are worn to muffle the loud noises during the scanning. Functional MRI measures blood flow changes in the brain during the performance of specific tasks.

Behavioral measurements:

Grating orientation task: The subject responds as quickly as possible to a touch stimulus to the finger by saying whether the direction of the stimulus is vertical or horizontal.
Haptic object recognition task: The subject is given five categories of unfamiliar objects in the shape of cubes. During the task, identical objects are hidden in a sack. With eyes closed, the subject is asked to identify and find the objects from the sack as quickly as possible.
Pegboard test: The subject is asked to place several pegs into a corresponding hole of a pegboard as soon as possible.
Tapping task: The subject is asked to tap a metal stick on a metal plate as quickly as possible for 1 minute.
Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation: This test measures changes in brain activity. A wire coil is held on the scalp and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The subject hears a click and may fee a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil, and there may be a twitch in the muscles of the face, arm or leg. Subjects may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions.

NCT00286702,"After a stroke, many people develop contracture of the muscles in their affected wrist and hand which leads to a permanently clenched, painful hand. A contracture is often treated by therapists who use hand splinting to prevent it occurring or slow down its progression. Despite their wide use, there has not been research completed to investigate whether or not splinting prevents contracture in people following stroke. In fact, this project will be the first of its kind in the world and is therefore vital to stroke rehabilitation.

The study is a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial that will measure the effect of hand-splinting in two positions on the prevention of contracture, functional use of the hand, and quality of life."

1. Research Question to be addressed

The utilization of SEMG biofeedback monitoring in dysphagia rehabilitation facilitates more rapid and complete recovery than traditional rehabilitation using the same swallowing exercises without exteroceptive feedback.
Swallowing rehabilitation provided in an intensive rehabilitative programme (10 hrs of treatment in the 1st week) facilitates more rapid and complete recovery than traditionally scheduled swallowing rehabilitation (twice weekly)."

NCT04019522,"Of the 795,000 people who experience a stroke every year in the US, only a small percentage will achieve full recovery. While current therapies promote strength and endurance, none directly address the unique potential of the brain to reorganize following injury. The goal of this project is to explore the effects of a novel therapy, acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH). During this therapy, individuals receive brief bouts of reduced oxygen levels by inhalation through a face mask. (This is akin to being on top of a tall mountain). In brief exposures, AIH is known to trigger the release of specific proteins that help the brain adapt to oxygen reductions. Published results in people with incomplete spinal cord injury have shown that AIH enhances muscle strength and coordination rather quickly. The research team aims to study the effects of AIH in stroke survivors."
NCT00295399,"The goal of this project is to develop a low-cost, user-friendly, portable telerehabilitation system for physical therapy of the upper limb after stroke or traumatic brain injury. The system is based on the use of a commercially available force feedback joystick and will work with an ordinary home PC and a standard high-speed internet connection. Using the joystick, the patient will perform exercises designed to aid in recovering motor function of the hand and arm. The joystick will be programmed to either assist or resist the patient's movements. The system will include sophisticated analysis of patient status and progress to provide the therapist and physician with detailed information. In the first phase of the study, we will develop the system in cooperation with the physical therapy staff and other rehabilitation specialists. The investigators will examine the usability, comfort, safety and therapeutic benefit of the system. In the second phase of the study, the investigators will employ the system in patients' homes, using the internet to connect to rehabilitation specialists in the clinic. The study hypothesis is that it is possible to adapt commercially available, low cost gaming equipment such as force feedback joysticks to provide therapy for patients in their own homes, and that patients will be able to work with this system and will find it enjoyable and helpful for recovering motor function."

NCT00305513,"Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) is believed to be a disorder of attention, characterized by impairment in the ability to perceive or respond to stimuli presented to the contralesional space, and which is not attributable to significant sensory or motor deficits. USN has serious consequences for rehabilitation and long term disabilities. Efforts have been made to clarify both the theoretical basis of this phenomenon and the rehabilitation methods that will be best in improving function. The purpose of this study is to try and contribute to both efforts by examining treatment effectiveness of two methods; one targeting general arousal (phasic alerting), and the other targeting increasing awareness to left side stimuli and habit changes. Functional neuroimaging methods (PET [positron emission tomography] and fMRI [functional magnetic resonance imaging]) have been applied to understand the functional anatomy of the brain during mental processes. Only a few attempts have been made to use functional neuroimaging in patients with neurological deficits such as USN, usually speculations are made based on findings with healthy participants to explain this disorder. This study's aim is to examine the functional reorganization of the attentional network in the brain of USN patients while performing visual tasks, by means of functional neuroimaging techniques, in light of specific rehabilitation techniques.

Patients will be examined before and after 3 weeks of rehabilitation both using standardized neurobehavioral tests and PET imaging procedures."
NCT00306501,"This study will compare several techniques designed to improve the ability to swallow in stroke patients with chronic dysphagia (difficulty swallowing).

Healthy volunteers 20 to 60 years of age and people 20 to 90 years of age who have had a stroke resulting in swallowing problems may be eligible for this study. Volunteers are screened with a medical history, physical examination, and urine test for women to rule out pregnancy. Stroke patients are screened additionally with a chest x-ray, physical examination, cognitive screening, swallowing questionnaires, nasoendoscopy (examination of the nasal passages in the back of the throat using a lighted telescopic instrument) and FEESST (passage of a thin, flexible telescope through the nose to the voice box), videofluoroscopy (x-ray of the head and neck during swallowing) and button press training (learning how to press a button on a table in coordination with swallowing).

All participants undergo the following procedures:

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): A metal coil is placed on the head and sends a pulse of energy to the brain through the scalp. The muscle response to the pulse is recorded from the muscles in the throat that are associated with swallowing.
Electromyography: A needle is used to insert tiny wires in specific muscles of the throat to record the muscle response to the TMS pulses.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): During brain MRI scanning, subjects lie quietly and images of the brain are taken.

In addition to the above tests, stroke patients undergo the following:

Water test: The subject swallows a small amount of water and the number of times required to clear the throat or cough is counted. This test is repeated five times.

Experimental training. Subjects have a total of 12 60-minute training sessions, one session a day for up to 5 sessions a week.

Button press training: The subject swallows small amounts of water. A device placed on the throat senses when swallowing occurs. The subject learns how to coordinate pressing a button on a table in coordination with swallowing.
Vibrotactile stimulator training: A device that uses a buzzing vibration is placed on the throat at times during the swallowing training.
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS): Wires attached to sponge electrodes are placed on the scalp and over the eye. Small electric currents are delivered to areas of the brain involved with swallowing. This is done at times during the swallowing training.

Participants may receive one of several combinations of training approaches; all receive the volitional (button-press) training. Within 5 days of completing training, subjects repeat the tests. TMS, MRI, MEG and x-ray study of swallowing function are also repeated to see if any changes have occurred in the brain or in the ability to swallow after training. Patients are contacted by telephone and in writing 3 and 6 months after training for follow-up on their swallowing status and oral intake."
NCT00306579,"Introduction

For several years ""ischemic"" electrocardiographic (ECG) changes in the acute phase of ischemic stroke have been reported. Whether these ECG changes reflect true myocardial ischemia remains controversial. So far no study has assessed different markers of myocardial ischemia or necrosis in consecutive patients admitted to hospital with an acute ischemic stroke.

Purpose

The main purpose of this study is to determine the potential burden of reversible and irreversible myocardial ischemia in patients with an acute ischemic stroke.

Patients and methods

Serial blood samples for measuring troponin T, CK-MB and NT-proBNP are collected in 250 patients with evidence of an acute ischemic stroke admitted to the Department of Neurology at Odense University Hospital. In addition resting 12-lead ECG recordings will be obtained on a daily basis, and a 24-hour ST-segment ambulatory monitoring will be performed once within the first week of hospitalisation. Finally, myocardial perfusion patterns during rest will be evaluated by means of a myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in patients with an elevated troponin T level.

Six months later control measurements of troponin T, CK-MB and NT-proBNP and a 12-lead ECG will be obtained.

Expectations

The study will contribute with original observations in patients with acute ischemic stroke considering the following issues:

The prevalence and characteristics of ECG changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia.
The prevalence of transient ST-segment changes on ambulatory monitoring.
The prevalence and degree of myocardial necrosis as judged from biochemical markers.
The prevalence of reversible and irreversible perfusion defects on myocardial scintigraphy.
The prevalence, size and patterns of NT-proBNP.
Whether there is a change in ECG and biochemical markers over a 6-month follow-up period.

The results may have clinical implications regarding early and late treatment as well as clinical follow-up of patients recovering from an episode of acute ischemic stroke."
NCT00307385,"This study will examine whether hand movement in stroke patients can be improved by applying electrical stimulation to the side of the brain affected by the stroke. It will compare the effects of similar brain stimulations in stroke patients and healthy volunteers.

Healthy, right-handed normal volunteers and stroke patients between 18 and 80 years of age may be eligible for this study. Patients' stroke must have occurred at least 3 months before entering the study and affect one side of the brain only. Candidates are screened with a medical history, brain MRI, and evaluation of memory and attention span. Pregnant women are excluded from the study.

The study involves seven 2-day sessions over the course of about 8 weeks, with each session separated by at least 1 week. During each session participants practice a pattern of hand movements and their accuracy in performing the movements is evaluated before and after brain electrical stimulation. The movements include a complex finger sequence, a simple finger sequence, a peg test (placing wooden pegs in holes on a board), a hand function test (turning over cards, picking up small objects with one hand and placing them in a can, picking up small objects with a spoon and placing them in a can, stacking checkers, moving light cans, and moving heavy cans), and a box and block test (picking up and moving blocks from one box to another).

The first day of each 2-day session lasts about 5 hours and includes the following:

TMS measurements: A wire coil is held on the scalp, and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During the stimulation, the subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. The stimulation may cause a twitch in muscles of the face, arm, or leg, and the subject may hear a click and feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil.
tDCS: Small, wet sponge electrodes are applied to the head - one above the eye and the other on the back of the head. A small electrical current is passed between them. The subject may feel an itching or tingling sensation under the electrodes or see light flashes. Some sessions are done with sham tDCS.
Motor learning under tDCS: tDCS is repeated while the subject performs different finger movements. A new pattern of finger movements is taught each session.
Surface electromyography: Electrodes are filed with a conductive gel and taped to the skin over one small hand muscle to measure the electrical activity of muscles.
Behavioral measurements: Evaluation of learned movement tasks
Questionnaires to evaluate the subject's attention, fatigue and mood before and after testing

The second day of each session lasts about 2 hours and includes the TMS measurements and behavior measurements."

NCT00721357,"Of the ~700,000 persons who suffer a stroke each year, only 50% recover the ability to perform unlimited community walking. One mechanism contributing to locomotor dysfunction post-stroke is an increased metabolic cost of walking relative to neurologically healthy individuals 2-4. This increased cost likely limits the amount of walking performed, which further reduces functional capacity, thus contributing to long-term spiral of disability and decreased quality of life in these persons. In addition to increased metabolic cost, increased estimates of mechanical work are also characteristic of hemiparetic walking 2,29. Interestingly, although estimates of mechanical work reflect work done by locomotor muscles, little is known about the impact that peripheral muscle properties have on estimates of mechanical work. Furthermore, questions concerning how these properties relate to the increased metabolic cost of walking remain unanswered. The short-term objective and purpose of the proposed research is to determine the extent to which peripheral muscle characteristics, as well as estimates of muscle mechanical energy expenditure (MMEE), relate to the metabolic cost of walking post-stroke."
NCT03611816,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. This arrhythmia is responsible for 15% of strokes and more than 30% of strokes on people over 65 years.

According to studies, 30 to 40% of isolated atrial fibrillations could be familial. Atrial fibrillation has significant genetic heterogeneity. About 40 genes have been identified as potentially involved. Studies have identified genes common to the risk of atrial fibrillation and stroke. Despite the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation has been intensively and extensively studied for almost a century, there are still many questions. The pathophysiology is not sufficiently understood to allow finding more effective therapies. It is necessary to identify genetic determinants and thus potentially new pharmacological targets more adapted.

The establishment of a biological database will test hypotheses concerning the genetic origin and thromboembolic process of atrial fibrillation and associated stroke."
NCT05280587,"Stroke represents the leading cause of disability worldwide, with a significant impact on an individual, family, and economic impact. The recovery of smoother, safer, and more correct walking is an essential requirement to allow the patient to regain autonomy in the activities of daily living. Some preliminary studies have shown that robotic training of the gait training has influenced the functional and motor outcome in patients with stroke outcomes an improvement in endurance and walking strategies was observed. In addition, frequently, a stroke involves an alteration of the cognitive system that contributes to the deterioration of balance and gait during dual-task activities; the study of these processes can be of interest for rehabilitation purposes. Considering these preliminary data and that the patient must continuously find balance in overground walking, it is believed that a robotic balance treatment associated with conventional therapy may be more effective than conventional therapy alone. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effects of technological rehabilitation utilizing a robotic platform (Hunova® Movendo Technology srl, Genova, IT):

(i) in terms of improvement in static, dynamic balance, and ambulation (assessed with clinical scales and instrumental measures);
(ii) on fatigue, on cognitive performance in terms of sustained attention, dual-task cost and cognitive-motor interference and on quality of life."

NCT00354081,"PURPOSE OF STUDY Observational studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of plasma total homocysteine is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the clinical effects of homocysteine lowering treatment with B vitamins during 3-5 years follow-up of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization for suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). Special attention will be given to complication rates among patients needing subsequent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PCI) or coronary artery by-pass grafting (CABG).

HYPOTHESIS The primary hypothesis of this study is that, among patients with CAD, a daily supplement with B vitamins will reduce the risk for cardiovascular mortality and serious cardiovascular events with at least 20%. The secondary hypothesis of this study is that, among patients with CAD, a daily supplement with B vitamins will reduce the risk for total mortality, coronary events, cerebrovascular events and other cardiovascular events. The hypothesis will be tested for an effect of any of the treatments (folic acid / vitamin B12 or B6), and the effect will be evaluated according to initial total homocysteine levels and B vitamin levels as well as to the change in these levels after 1 and 6 months. The sample size has been calculated to 3088 patients using a two-sided chi-square test with significance 0.05 and at an 80% power level, presumed event rate of 22% over 4 years, and event rate reduction of 20%, adjusted for non-compliance/drop-out of 20%.

STUDY DESIGN This is a controlled, double-blind two-centre trial with 3090 included men and women who underwent coronary angiography at Haukeland University Hospital or Stavanger University Hospital between April 1999 and April 2004. At baseline about 1300 patients underwent PCI and 600 underwent CABG. The patients were randomized into 4 groups in a 2 x 2 factorial design to receive one of the following four treatments: A, folic acid 0.8 mg plus vitamin B12 0.4 mg and vitamin B6 40 mg per day; B, folic acid 0.8 mg plus vitamin B12 0.4 mg per day; C, vitamin B6 40 mg per day; D, placebo. The active drug and the placebo tablets had identical appearance and taste. Treatment was started as soon as the patients were randomized after the coronary angiography procedure. The patients have been undergoing interviews, clinical examination and blood-sampling at baseline, at follow-up after 1 month and 1 year, and at a final study visit. In addition, information on dietary habits was obtained from 2400 patients at baseline. Among 350 patients that have undergone PCI at baseline, a full clinical examination, blood sampling and repeat coronary angiography to assess re-stenosis has been performed about 9 (6-12) months after the PCI procedure. For these patients, angiograms suitable for quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) analysis have been obtained at the baseline and follow-up invasive procedures.

The follow-up was terminated ahead of schedule in October 2005 due to lack of compliance of the participants caused by media reports from the NORVIT study (NCT00266487) on potential increased cancer risk associated by B vitamin supplementation. The patients had then been followed for 1.5 - 5 years.

STUDY END POINTS Primary clinical endpoints during follow-up are all cause death, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, acute hospitalization for unstable angina and non-fatal thromboembolic stroke (infarction). Secondary endpoints are fatal and non-fatal acute myocardial infarction (including procedure related myocardial infarction), acute hospitalization for angina, stable angina with angiographic verified progression, myocardial revascularization, fatal and non-fatal thromboembolic stroke."
NCT00343174,Treatment of acute stroke is still difficult and the only specific drug approved (rtPA) can only be administered if treatment starts within 3 hours after onset of symptoms.

Ancrod is a differently acting biological drug which has been used for a long time but not for acute stroke treatment. STAT was the first RCT of medium size to show a significant benefit/risk ration if treatment starts within 3 hours. ESTAT was designed closely related to STAT but with a longer 6 hours window and specifically extended inclusion/exclusion criteria to avoid secondary complications possibly related to a longer time window.

NCT00357513,"This study will characterize the gene response of the body's immune and inflammatory cells to stroke. There is a wide variation in stroke risk, stroke outcome, and response to clot-busting therapy for stroke. This variation may be due to differences in people's response to injury or infection, or to differences in genetic make-up between individuals. Genes store the biological information that determines the body's response to injury or infection. This study will analyze the activity of a large number of genes to try to learn which genes might be related to patient outcome. This, in turn, may lead to an understanding of which gene profiles are related to increased stroke risk and increased disability or death.

Healthy volunteers over age 21 and stroke patients over age 21 who are admitted to the NIH Stroke Program at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md., may be eligible for this study. Volunteers will be screened with a medical history, blood pressure and pulse measurements, electrocardiogram, and neurological examination.

Participants will have 20 to 35 milliliters (about an ounce) of blood drawn for genetic studies. The genetic material will be extracted from the white blood cells and analyzed for normal and abnormal gene activity related to stroke.

Patients presenting with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke who have evidence of a large vessel (2.5mm or greater in diameter) occlusion in the cerebral circulation will be assigned to either the Penumbra System with the Separator 3D or the Penumbra System without the Separator 3D. Each treated patient will be followed and assessed for 3 months after randomization. Up to 230 evaluable patients at up to 50 centers presenting with acute ischemic stroke in vessels accessible to the Penumbra Separator 3D System for revascularization within 8 hours of symptom onset. The hypothesis to be tested is that the safety and effectiveness of the Penumbra System with the Separator 3D for the revascularization of large vessel occlusion is not inferior to the Penumbra System alone."
NCT05578300,"As a major breakthrough of acute stroke treatment over the past decade, endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) drastically improved neurological recovery and survival in patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) ischemic strokes in major clinical trials. Nevertheless, much remained uncertain about the implementation of scientific evidence of EVT into real-world benefits. For instance, healthcare policies that influence critical time-matrices, endovascular thrombectomy techniques that may enhance success rate or prevent complications, or advanced imaging techniques that allow precise prognosis or expansion of treatment populations, should be evaluated. On the other hand, capturing LVO patients who were not able to undergo EVT may reveal the gap between clinical trials and real-world practice in the Asia-Pacific.

In this multicenter prospective collaboration across the Asian-Pacific, the investigators aim to evaluate the determinants of effective EVT in the real-world setting."
NCT00110175,"This study will determine in stroke patients whether stimulation of the injured side of the brain combined with stimulation of the weak hand can temporarily improve motor function of the paralyzed hand. It will also examine whether stimulation of the healthy side of the brain combined with stimulation of the weak hand can temporarily improve motor function in the paralyzed hand.

Healthy adult volunteers and adults who have had a stroke more than 3 months before entering the study may be eligible to participate. Candidates are screened with a physical and neurological examination. Stroke patients also have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a test that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of the brain.

Participants perform several tasks (described below) in a practice session and then during five more sessions on separate days. They perform the tasks before and after undergoing transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) plus electrical stimulation (ES), and during a procedure that involves sham stimulation. For tDCS, small rubber electrodes are soaked with water and taped to the subject's head, one above the eye and the other on the back of the head. The current passes between the two electrodes. For ES, two pairs of electrodes are attached to the subject's wrist with a paste. A very short pulse of current is passed between the electrodes, creating an electrical field that stimulates the brain. For the sham stimulation, the electrodes are similarly placed, but there is no stimulation. The tasks are:

Jebsen-Taylor test: Subjects write, lift small common objects like paper clips, and perform activities like turning pages, stacking checkers or lifting large objects. They do these tasks as fast as possible.
Pinch force: Subjects press a wedged instrument between their thumb and index finger as hard as they can. There are several trials every 10 seconds.
Speed tapping: Subjects press a key on a keyboard as quickly as possible for 10 seconds.
Simple reaction time task: Subjects perform a quick wrist movement as quickly as possible in response to a ""go"" signal presented on a computer monitor. Muscle activity in the forearm is recorded using electrodes.
Motor sequence learning/Learning a finger movement sequence: Subjects practice a finger movement exercise on a keyboard by pressing keys that correspond to a number displayed on a video screen.
Visual analog scales: Subjects complete three questionnaires about their attention, fatigue, and mood.
Sensory monitoring: Subjects are blindfolded and asked to judge the difference in various sensations, such as the feel of plastic domes with gratings, vibration, or a plastic hair applied to their fingertip.
Scoring MRC scale: The muscle strength of the subject's hands is measured.
Fugl-Meyer scale: The subject's ability to move his or her limbs is measured.
Mini-mental state examination: The subject's mental ability is measured briefly.
Handedness questionnaire: The subject's dominant hand is determined.

Participants also undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electromyography (EMG) before, during and after these activities. For TMS, a wire coil is held on the scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected with small electrodes taped to the skin of the arms or legs. EMG measures the electrical activity of the muscles. For this test, small electrodes are taped to the skin over the muscle."

NCT02911129,"Background:

After a stroke, the balance between the two halves of the brain can be lost. This may cause people to lose the ability to perceive a side of space. This is called neglect. Having people wear prism glasses (called PA) can reduce neglect symptoms. Researchers want to find out more about how PA, and whether it restores the balance in the brain.

Objective:

To learn how prism adaption temporarily changes vision and connections in the brain.

Eligibility:

People ages 18 75 with brain damage of the right side of the brain from a stroke or other cause, leading to neglect.

Healthy volunteers ages 18 75.

Design:

Participants will have 1 3 visits.

Participants will be screened with a neurological exam. They may also have:

Tests of thinking and vision

Tests to see which eye and hand they prefer

A pregnancy test

All participants will:

Answer questions about their personality, style of thinking, and beliefs.

Do simple tasks on paper or computer

Have magnetic resonance imaging. They will lie on a table that can slide in and out of a cylinder in a strong magnetic field. Participants will lie still or do computer tasks in the scanner.

Participants may also have:

Transcranial magnetic stimulation. A brief electrical current passes through a wire coil on the scalp. This creates a magnetic pulse that affects brain activity. Participants may be asked to tense certain muscles or perform simple actions or tasks.

PA. They will sit in front of a board and point to a dot on it while they wear prism glasses that shift vision to the left or right."
NCT02460809,"This is a device feasibility study, which will assess telerehabilitation in people with chronic stroke using a combination of noninvasive brain stimulation and finger tracking training. Telerehabilitation allows patients to train in their own home which also allows for longer training periods than what is currently allowed clinically. Noninvasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) uses two surface electrodes connected to a small battery that will be attached to the head. This will be used to modulate neuronal excitability. With sensors attached to fingers and the wrist, the patient will move the joints to track a target displayed on a screen. The combined treatment will be applied in two experiments. The first will be on 3 patients coming to our lab and the second on 3 patients in their home, both under supervision. We will integrate the two components and test the resulting and novel treatment system for technical feasibility, which will set the stage for future efficacy studies under federal grant support.

NCT04314388,"This research project aims to improve and promote physical activity participation in the outdoors and use outdoor walking as a form of long-term rehabilitation for young adults who have had a stroke.

This research is specifically focused on adults of working age (e.g. 18 to 65 years classed as young adults) as there is little to no research or rehabilitation programmes for young adults who have had a stroke on how best to regain function and independence to return to social/leisure activities, employment and education. During this study, The investigators will measure how fast a young adult who has had a stroke walks, how much energy they use to walk and how their joints move when walking. The investigators will also use questionnaires to measure how confident a young adult who has had a stroke is and how they feel when outdoors.

This project could highlight the positive role of exercising in outdoor natural environments to promote recovery following stroke in young adults. The investigators predict that an outdoor-walking rehabilitation programme could motivate the young stroke population to better engage in their rehabilitation, as walking in more challenging environments could facilitate an increase in the desire to walk outdoors and confidence."

NCT04945356,"BACKGROUND:

Although rehabilitation is effective in restoring function, many elderly individuals, especially those who have survived a stroke, are no longer receiving adequate rehabilitation services during the COVID19 pandemic due to containment measures. To overcome this problem, telerehabilitation is a promising avenue to deliver customized and personalized at-home therapy sessions while adhering to physical distancing guidelines.

OBJECTIVES:

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using customized and personalized at-home therapy sessions using the Physiotec application for individuals with a stroke. A second objective is to measure the potential efficacy of the telerehabilitation intervention at improving function and quality of life based on standardized clinical measures and measures of improvement implemented in the Physiotec application.

METHODS:

We propose a non-randomized, single-group trial. Twenty-five individuals will be recruited on a voluntary basis. To be included, participants must 1) be ≥18 years old; 2) have a single unilateral stroke (≥ 6 months); 3) have minimal return of function in the affected upper limb; and 4) no longer be receiving rehabilitation treatments. Participants will receive a tablet containing the Physiotec application training program and TERA+, a telerehabilitation platform. The training program of the affected upper limb will last 6 weeks (90 minutes/week) and will be updated 3 times (weeks 1-3-5) by the therapist, using the TERA+ platform, based on the participant's functional capacity and progress, as measured by the app. Feasibility will be assessed by means of retention rate, adverse events, adherence to the telerehabilitation intervention, satisfaction with its use and with the exercise program. Efficacy will be assessed by several questionnaires on life habits, motor recovery and quality of life.

RELEVANCE:

This study will inform as to the optimal delivery of adapted rehabilitation services for stroke survivors that are currently not receiving optimal rehabilitation services because of the ongoing COVID19 pandemic. The results will serve to support in-home rehabilitation exercises aimed at promoting recovery, independent living and improving quality of life for stroke survivors."

NCT00039832,"This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of two types of blood thinners, abciximab (ReoPro) and reteplase (Retavase) for restoring normal brain blood flow after ischemic stroke (stroke resulting from a blood clot in the brain).

The only therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat ischemic stroke is the clot buster drug rt-PA. This treatment, however, is effective only if begun within 3 hours of onset of the stroke and most patients do not get to the hospital early enough to benefit from it. There is thus a pressing need to develop effective stroke treatments that can be initiated more than 3 hours after onset.

Patients between 18 and 80 years of age who have experienced a mild or moderate acute stroke between 3 and 24 hours before starting study drugs may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a physical examination, blood tests and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (if an MRI was not done during the stroke evaluation).

All participants will receive ReoPro. Some will also receive Retavase, which may boost the effectiveness of ReoPro. Retavase is administered in a single dose through a needle in the vein over 2 minutes. ReoPro is infused into the vein over 12 hours. Patients will be monitored with physical examinations, blood tests, computed tomography (CT) scans, and three or four MRI scans of the brain to evaluate both the response to treatment and side effects of the drugs. An MRI scan will be done 24 hours, 5 days and 30 days after starting the study medication, and possibly during screening for this study.

CT involves the use of specialized x-rays to obtain images of the brain. The patient lies still in the scanner for a short time while the X-ray images are formed. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to demonstrate structural and chemical changes in tissue. MRI is more sensitive than x-ray in evaluating acute stroke. The patient lies on a table in a metal cylinder (the scanner) while the pictures are being taken. During part of the MRI, a medicine called gadolinium contrast is injected in a vein. This medicine brightens the images, creating better pictures of the blood flow."

NCT05374239,"Background: Using outcome measures is emphasized in foundational training and clinical practice guidelines, but less than 50% of rehabilitation professionals consistently use outcome measures in practice. No studies have evaluated the barriers to routine outcome measurement in Singapore's healthcare settings nor identified effective implementation strategies to sustain the use of outcome measures in practice.

Aims: To evaluate the effectiveness of a tailored multi-component implementation intervention effectiveness in improving the consistency of use of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity (FMA) among occupational therapists practicing in 4 hospitals in Singapore.

Method: The project will use the Normalisation Process Theory as a framework and data collection sites will include Singapore General Hospital, Sengkang General Hospital, Outram Community Hospital, and Sengkang Community Hospital. The investigators will use a stepped-wedge randomised trial design. The study will begin with an initial period in which no hospitals are exposed to the intervention. Subsequently, at regular intervals, one hospital will cross from the control to the intervention. The investigators will continue this process until the intervention is introduced to all hospitals. The intervention will be fully implemented by the end of the trial, with all 4 hospitals receiving the multi-component intervention.

Project Significance: This trial is part of a larger project that uses a theory-driven approach to systematically explore the embedding and integration of outcome measures in routine clinical care for rehabilitation professionals in Singapore (beyond initial implementation stages). Study findings will contribute to the scientific knowledge base of implementing outcome measures in clinical practice, improve patient care, and support future implementation projects on outcome measurement in different populations and healthcare settings."

NCT00366184,"This study will examine whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the brain used in combination with carbidopa-levodopa is more effective in temporarily improving the speed of hand movement in stoke patients than TMS alone. In TMS, a wire coil is held on the patient's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected with small metal disk electrodes taped to the skin of the arms or legs. Carbidopa-levodopa is a medication usually used to treat Parkinson's disease, but it may improve the effect of theta burst stimulation.

Two kinds of TMS are used in this study. In single-pulse TMS one or two pulses are delivered at a time in order to measure brain activity at that moment. In repetitive TMS (rTMS), a series of pulses are given in short bursts, temporarily altering brain activity. The type of rTMS used in this study is called theta burst stimulation.

Healthy normal volunteers and people who had a stroke 6 months or more before entering the study may be eligible to participate. All candidates must be between 18 and 90 years of age. Stroke patients must have had significant hand weakness and made a moderate or good recovery and must be able to move either the thumb or the wrist on the affected hand reasonably well. Normal volunteers must be right-handed.

Participants complete the testing for this study in four main sessions scheduled at least a week apart and five short follow-up sessions. At each main session, participants take either a carbidopa-levodopa tablet or a placebo (a look-alike inactive substance). Stroke patients have their arm and hand function assessed using two tests. One requires them to insert pegs into holes; the other includes writing, lifting various objects, and performing activities like turning pages, feeding or stacking checkers.

All subjects complete a questionnaire regarding their mood and alertness and then perform tests of thumb or wrist movement. For this test, a small electrical stimulus is applied to the side of the hand and the subject must respond to the stimulus as quickly as possible by making a thumb or wrist movement. This is repeated several times over about 3 minutes. A second test follows in which the subject moves the thumb or wrist in response to a beep from a speaker. This test is repeated several times over about 8 minutes. Some measurements are taken using single-pulse TMS during the beginning, middle and end of this test. In two of the four sessions, theta burst stimulation is applied after the single-pulse TMS and in the other two sessions, sham theta burst stimulation is applied.

Five follow-up sessions are scheduled one day after each main session and one week following the final one. In these sessions, subjects perform an abbreviated form of the thumb movement tests."

NCT04712747,"The eye has long been recognized as a window to pathological processes occurring in the brain. By imaging the vascular system of the retina scientific understanding and clinical practice have been improved for a wide range of pathologies from diabetes to stroke and dementia.

Adaptive optics (AO) reveals retinal details that remain invisible with other current imaging techniques. Indeed, vessels can be perfectly visualized, making it possible to detect wall irregularities, accurately measure their different structures and monitor their evolution under treatment if necessary.

In AO, studies on retinal vessels involve the calculation of wall thickness (WT), outer diameter (OD), inner diameter (ID), wall cross-sectional area (WCSA) and wall to lumen ratio (WLR). An increase in WLR > 0.31 is characteristic of hypertensive microangiopathy and predictive of cardiovascular and brain damage. This accurate assessment of microvascular structure may even be required in the near future in all patients with arterial hypertension. For vessels > 300 microns in diameter, the increase in vessel wall thickness occurs without changing the ID, a process known as external hypertrophic remodeling. For small arteries < 300 microns, remodeling occurs differently. The total volume of the vessel wall remains constant, but the OD and ID each decrease, a process known as inward eutrophic remodeling.

The objective of this study is to describe the parameters measured in AO in patients in the acute phase of a stroke and then at 3 months."

NCT01918748,"Rationale: Approx. 80% of acute stroke patients suffer from acute hemiparesis. Stroke patients have not reached their full potential when they are discharged from hospital. It is proven that extra training opportunities lead to further improvement. To date, new training possibilities, such as robotic techniques for rehabilitation, virtual reality training systems and tele-rehabilitation are being developed to aid in the training of stroke patients.

Objective: To obtain preliminary evidence on the efficacy of an individualised, intensive 6-week technology-assisted training regime, featuring a robotics-based self-adapting arm training system (I-TRAVLE) in a virtual context, focussed on improvement of arm function and arm skill performance in chronic stroke patients with low to moderate proximal (shoulder/arm) muscle strength.

Study design: single arm prospective cohort study. Study population: 16 stroke patients in the chronic phase after their stroke, aged >=18, diagnosed with a central paresis of the arm, having low to moderate proximal (shoulder and arm) muscle strength.

Intervention (if applicable): Haptic feedback of the I-TRAVLE robot either supports or challenges the patient to perform movements of the arm, thereby training motor control and co-ordination of the affected arm. Also strength and endurance of arm muscle use may be trained. The I-TRAVLE based training will last 6 weeks. Each week participants will attend training sessions on 3 days, during which they will train 2x 30 minutes, interspaced by at least half an hour to avoid (general) fatigue and overuse.

Main study parameters/endpoints: Baseline measurements will be performed 3x prior to the start of the intervention, each interspaced by 1 week to assess baseline stability or any fluctuations in baseline values. In these chronic stroke patients spontaneous improvement is not expected. Also measurements will be performed at 0 weeks and at 12 weeks post training.

In healthy human subjects verticality perception is accurate while upright.The strategy of this research is to quantify changes in verticality perception after unilateral lesions along the central graviceptive pathways and to assess the frequency and pattern of abnormal verticality perception in patients with acute stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic). Our underlying hypothesis is that screening for erroneous verticality perception by use of a mobile device assessing the subjective visual vertical (SVV) during the acute phase (i.e., within 24-48 hours after symptom onset) reliably identifies those patients with defects. Early detection of deficits in verticality perception may help to initiate balance physiotherapy early."
NCT04307108,"Background: Virtual Reality (VR) technology may help to provide a way for stroke survivors to exercise in their own time at home, with remote clinical support. Before we introduce this technology we need to test that it will work alongside current health services for stroke survivors. Aims: To find out if using the MAGIC-GLASS solution alongside current healthcare care is usable and acceptable to stroke survivors and helps to increase rehabilitation time. Design: Measures before and after stroke survivors use the MAGIC-GLASS solution.

Setting: Stroke survivors will use the MAGIC-GLASS solution in their own home. Population: adults (≥18 years) who have had a stroke at least two weeks before they enter into the study.

Interventions: Our VR technology is called MAGIC-GLASS, and in order to use the solution the user puts on a headset which is connected to a computer. They can then see a VR environment in which they will be able to see virtual hands that respond to the movements of their own hands. It will also be possible to see a mirror image of their hands moving. The system will record how much they use the system and improvement in their movement. Regular contact will be made with a clinician who will be able to use the system to see (from their clinic) how the stroke survivor is doing and talk to them. Outcomes: We want to find out how the stroke survivors' movement changes over time and what they think of using the system. We will also ask clinical staff what they thought of using the system as part of healthcare provision to stroke survivors. Finally we want to find out how much it will cost to use the system."

Stroke rehabilitation is increasingly home-based following early supported discharge (ESD) from hospital to facilitate self-management and avoid problems associated with prolonged hospital stays. There is strong evidence that intensive practice and re-education of normal movement is essential for functional motor recovery, hence the NHS guideline of 45 minutes therapy 5 days per week, but NHS Trusts have difficulty meeting this target due to cost and access to specialist therapists.

An M-MARK Mk1 device that combines an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) with an Mechanomyography (MMG) sensor has been designed and laboratory tested. Novel signal processing techniques have been demonstrated that reduce problems of vibration artifacts and generate information on mechanical muscle activity and movement. The aim of the overall M-MARK project is to develop a low-cost wearable wireless device (Mk2) that patients can use independently at home while practicing standardised everyday activities to regain upper limb function. Mk2 M-MARK has now been developed in collaboration with therapists, patients and their carers. The system incorporates feedback, presented on a computer/tablet, as motivating visualisations of movement showing them if they have moved in the correct way. A separate interface has been developed for therapists, which offers a simple system to diagnose specific movement problems to inform clinical decision-making, monitor progress and thus increase efficiency of therapy.

In phase 1 of this study, user requirements were assessed to inform the development of the Mk2 M-MARK for clinical use. Ten patients and carers were interviewed and 20 health professionals took part in two focus groups, from Portsmouth Hospitals NHS trust and North Bristol NHS Trust. The Mk2 system has now been developed, reliability demonstrated and iterative testing with stroke patients has ensured usability of the system.

This phase of research will examine the clinical feasibility of using Mk2 M-MARK with stroke patients who are undergoing early supported discharge. All feasibility aspects of the wearable system will be assessed including usability and safety. Preliminary data on efficacy will be collected and a health economics analysis will be undertaken."
NCT02377167,"Patients with severe ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, who require mechanical ventilation, have a particularly bad prognosis. If they require long-term ventilation, their orotracheal tube needs to be, like in any other intensive care patient, replaced by a shorter tracheal tube below the larynx. This so called tracheostomy might be associated with advantages such as less demand of narcotics and pain killers, less lesions in mouth and larynx, better mouth hygiene, safer airway, more patient comfort and earlier mobilisation. The best timepoint for tracheostomy in stroke, however, is not known. Preliminary data from a pilot study of early tracheostomy in patients with hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke suggest that such patients may also have improved survival and long-term functional outcomes, but a large, multicenter clinical trial is needed to confirm these findings."
NCT04646577,We propose to enhance the effects of brain plasticity using a powerful noninvasive technique for brain modulation consisting of navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) priming with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in combination with motor-training-like constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT).

NCT04759326,"Cerebrovascular accident [CVA] (medical term for stroke) is a high burden worldwide disorder and the second leading cause of disability. As illustrated by the number of survivors that remain disabled after a CVA (2 out of 3 according to the US National Stroke Association), recovery is limited, and novel neurorehabilitation approaches are urgently needed. Hippotherapy is an emerging specialized rehabilitation approach, performed by accredited health professionals on a specially trained horse via its movement. A body of scientific evidence has gradually emerged in recent years, showing robust benefits of hippotherapy in various massive neurological disabling conditions including brain stroke.

The aim of the study is to analyze the effect of a hippotherapy program of several cycles delivered during 22 weeks in total, on the functional and global evolution of post-stroke patients (with a score of Rankin ≥ 3 at inclusion) during the outpatient rehabilitation phase. A second purpose is to measure the impact of the intervention on the quality of life of their close caregivers.

A prospective clinical trial on the effectiveness of hippotherapy versus conventional outpatient rehabilitation alone will be carried out. The 22-weeks program includes three cycles of hippotherapy as follows: an initial 2-weeks cycle, an intermediate 1-week cycle and a final 1-week cycle. One-hour daily sessions will be conducted during each cycle exclusive additional rehabilitation care. After each cycle, the patients will have a 9-weeks rest period where they will continue their conventional therapy. A battery of clinical tests will measure both functional and psychological outcome. The primary end point will be the functional independence of the patient. The secondary end points will consider the patient's sensorimotor and cognitive function, the severity of stroke and the quality of life, as well as the caregivers' burden and quality of life.

Program evaluation is important in neurorehabilitation to ensure that patients are achieving meaningful outcomes from the care. A primary question is how do stroke patients clinically evolve after being discharged from the hospital and how stable is the achieved rehabilitation outcome. Hippotherapy optimizes brain plasticity and has a strong impact on the global rehabilitation process and functional outcome of these patients. A remaining question concerns the improvement of the caregivers' quality of life."
NCT05087719,To determine effects of proprioceptive activities on hand function in chronic stroke patients
NCT04166968,"Several previous studies have used tDCS as a neuromodulation tool, showing improvements in several diseases (Lefaucheur et al., 2017). Based on these observations, it is believed that the use of tDCS in combination with specific motor training may provide the opportunity to induce behavioral improvements in patients with motor deficits. As shown in previous reports brain stimulation can, in fact, interact with the intrinsic ability of the brain to ""repair"" damaged brain functions, increasing the involvement of compensatory functional networks and thus inducing neuroplasticity. If these low-cost, easy-to-use stimulation techniques prove to be useful in improving motor deficits with long-term effects, the current study would open up new and interesting avenues in the field of neurorehabilitation. Given the potential long-lasting effects of tDCS, there is currently a growing interest in the clinical sector with the aim to reduce motor deficits in patients with brain injury. The most widely used protocols in stroke patients include the application of either anodal on the hypsilesional hemisphere or cathodal tDCS on the unaffected hemisphere (contralateral), so as to increase and decrease the excitability of the motor cortex, respectively (Nitsche and Paulus, 2001).

The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation in enhancing the functional recovery of the upper limb of stroke patients after three weeks of neuromotor training and subsequent follow-up. The secondary objective is to evaluate the treatment effects on balance, gait, motor dexterity and disability, besides the functional recovery of the lower limb."

NCT03153020,"The effectiveness of emergency management of acute ischemic stroke has improved considerably in recent years with thrombolysis and more recently thrombectomy. This improvement is accompanied by an increase in the number of stroke survivors. One of the major issues for these ever-increasing survivors is the prevention of recurrence. According to data from the 3 French registries, more than 20% of patients have at least one recurrence. Secondary prevention treatment has demonstrated his efficacy to prevent stroke recurrence.

This evolution justifies identifying factors associated with adherence to secondary prevention treatment, measured at 1 year post-stroke / transient ischemic attack (TIA), in patients included in the STROKE 69 cohort."

The aim of the study is to determine whether there is an association between perioperative covert stroke and postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients undergoing noncardiac surgery."
NCT05064891,"The suprascapular nerve is the first nerve that branches from the upper trunk of brachial plexus. It receives signals transmitted from the fifth and sixth cervical root. The clinical importance of suprascapular nerve is mainly based on its distribution of 70% sensory innervation to the glenohumeral joint. After being divided from the upper trunk, the suprascapular nerve goes laterally and posteriorly. First, it passes underneath the omohyoid muscle, and then goes through the suprascapular notch into the suprascapular fossa. If there are some problems inside the supraspinatus muscle at the suprascapular fossa, the suprascapular nerve below it may be compromised. After the suprascapular nerve passes the suprascapular fossa, it courses through the spinoglenoid notch, and then goes into the infraspinatus fossa to innervate the infraspinatus muscle. Based on the sensory and motor innervation of the suprascapular nerve to the shoulder joint, the sonographic images of the suprascapular nerves would add tremendous values in assessing patients with refractory shoulder pain. Although there are some studies trying to measure the size of the suprascapular nerve, no available research can be found in stroke patients. Our study aims to explore the ultrasound morphology of the suprascapular nerves as well as subacromial dynamic imaging in patients with stroke. A control group without stroke will be recruited for comparison."

NCT02346630,"Stroke is the leading cause of acquired long-term disability in adults in developed countries. Despite aggressive rehabilitation, lasting upper extremity impairment remains in the majority of stroke survivors. It is hypothesized that enhancing neuroplasticity through the combination of drug therapy and physical therapy could enhance outcomes for stroke survivors. The combination of levodopa and intensive physical therapy shows promise in enhancing the functional motor recovery of stroke patients during the sub-acute and chronic period without reported significant side effects. Robotic-aided training is a promising tool that has the potential to deliver high-intensity, task-oriented, reproducible therapy that can decrease the burden on a therapist. Since the evidence behind dopaminergic potentiation of neuroplasticity and stroke recovery is promising, it is the investigators aim to combine dopaminergic drug therapy with highly intensive robotic-assisted therapy to provide superior upper extremity functional recovery over traditional stroke rehabilitation."

Plasticity occurs in areas of residual vision (ARV) at the visual field which are the functional counterpart of partially damaged brain regions at the areas around brain lesion. Few treatment options are currently available for post-stroke VFD. In this pilot study, the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to these areas on VFD in patients with cortical infarction will be studied. Patients will be divided into two groups; an active group which will receive active stimulation and a sham group which will receive placebo stimulation through a sham coil."
NCT04991519,"Strokes often cause a loss of communication ability, referred to as aphasia, as well as cognitive difficulties. Each stroke survivor has a unique pattern of strengths and weaknesses in communication and cognition, and a unique course of recovery. The BUILD study aims to understand the brain basis of these individual differences in stroke outcome. Participants with stroke as well as controls matched in age, educational background, race, and sex are examined using a combination of standardized and in-house tests of language and cognition to provide a detailed profile of strengths and weaknesses. Each participant will have between three and six sessions, including an MRI to measure details of the structure, function, and connections in the brain. The data are analyzed to test how patterns in the stroke lesion explain the patterns of communication and cognitive difficulties, and how patterns in the uninjured parts of the brain explain resilience and recovery from the stroke. Ultimately, we hope that BUILD will guide us toward new targets for brain stimulation treatments or other biologically based treatments that improve language and cognitive abilities after stroke."

NCT03942588,"Aerobic conditioning is very important after stroke as it may reduce the risk of subsequent stroke and overall mortality. High-intensity interval training (HIIT), in which aerobic training workload is varied between lower and higher intensity bouts within a training session, is known to be effective for maximizing aerobic capacity in healthy individuals and those with cardiac disease. HIIT has not been studied extensively in adults with stroke, but it could be an efficient way to maximize aerobic capacity in this population. Furthermore, using heart rate response to establish training intensity may lead to underestimation of target intensity after stroke because blood pressure medications may blunt the heart rate response. Ventilatory threshold is an alternate method of establishing training intensity and is derived independently of heart rate response. The investigators hypothesized that a 10-week program of treadmill HIIT with intensity based on ventilatory threshold would be feasible in adults at least 6 months post-stroke, and would increase aerobic capacity."

NCT02974530,"The oropharyngeal junction participates in 3 interpenetrating functions: Swallowing, Breathing and Speech. In the context of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, these are altered, isolated or associated manner, causing major disorders and representing a source of handicap for patients.

Understanding the swallowing mechanisms is therefore a major challenge to guide the rehabilitation and improve the initial and long-term prognosis of patients with stroke.

The main objective of this study is to describe and modeling, thanks to a clinical, physiological and radiological knowledge base, swallowing, speech and breathing, in patients with stroke and in healthy subjects."
NCT01864928,"Despite abundant evident supporting the use of acute reperfusion therapy in the setting of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), adoption of this practice in routine clinical care is poor. We hypothesize that a significant barrier is the difficulty in weighing the benefits and risks of rt-PA treatment in the care of an individual patient, a problem compounded by the time urgency of decision-making and clinical fears that weigh risks of treatment more heavily than benefits.

The goal of this Quality Improvement (QI) study is to leverage an IT solution that we have developed, ePRISM, that executes multivariable risk models with patient-specific data so that a personalized estimate of an individual's outcomes (both risks and benefits) with and without rt-PA, can be generated so support safer, more effective clinical care. Through an earlier project, we will have programmed ePRISM with the best available risk-stratification models and developed a clinically useful format for presenting the data to support clinical decision-making in AIS.

Through QI, we propose to identify the optimal mechanism for integrating the tool within the routine flow of patient care in preparation for more definitive studies, or dissemination strategies, to improve the treatment of patients with AIS."

NCT02806856,"Very early after the onset of the focal perfusion deficit, excitotoxic mechanisms can lethally damage neurons and glia. Excitotoxicity triggers a number of events that can further contribute to tissue death. Such events include peri-infarct depolarizations (PID) and cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) within the peri-infarct zone or ischaemic penumbra. Noninvasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are emerging as promising tools, owing to their effects on modulating cortical activity. Experimental studies have indicated that cathodic polarization of the cortical surface blocks initiation of CSD. Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated in murine stroke models that cathodal tDCS exerts a measurable neuroprotective effect in the acute phase of stroke, decreasing the number of spreading depolarizations and reducing the infarct volume by 20 to 30%.

The investigators propose here a pilot study, in acute middle cerebral artery stroke patients, with a double blind randomization: cathodal tDCS versus sham tDCS. The duration of this study will be two years. Fifty acute middle cerebral artery stroke patients will be included. The tDCS will begin within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. The main criteria of evaluation will be the extent of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) infarct volume between imaging on admission and 24 hours later. The investigators propose the hypothesis that in acute stroke patients, cathodal tDCS could be an adjuvant approach to recanalizing therapies."

The investigators will then develop a short version by reducing the items and conduct a psychometric validation.

The translation and validation of a short French version of the SS-QoL scale will generate a reliable and sensitive, easy-to-use tool suitable for use in everyday practice.

NCT04121611,"Evidence regarding the role of early (<24 hours) antithrombotics post-revascularization with either intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), endovascular thrombectomy (EVT), or a combination of both remains scarce. In 2018 the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association changed their recommendation, stating that the risk of antithrombotic therapy within the first 24 hours after treatment with IVT (with or without EVT) is uncertain. This was changed after data emerged that early antithrombotics may be safe and may improve outcomes in select patients undergoing EVT.

Recently the investigators showed for the first time that significant residual basilar thrombus can exist after EVT despite complete angiographic revascularization using endovascular optical coherence tomography imaging. This residual thrombus could cause ongoing function-limiting strokes with occlusion of vital basilar perforators after EVT. Therefore, the investigators propose a prospective,non-randomized safety study to evaluate optical coherence tomography guided antithrombotic management for patients with confirmed residual thrombus after EVT for basilar occlusion."

NCT05454007,"The purpose of this proposal is to use novel video-based movement tracking technology to measure gait quality after stroke - in the home. Current rehabilitation practice assesses walking in the highly controlled 'ideal' clinical environment. The implicit assumption by clinicians and researchers is that the way people walk in the clinic (their best capacity) reflects the way they walk in the real-world (true performance). With advances in computer vision and development of pose estimation algorithms, it is now possible to directly measure how people are walking in their homes. It is critical that researchers apply this technology to examine the basic assumptions that underlie current rehabilitation practice. Here, a video-based pose estimation workflow will be used to 1) contrast the gait patterns of persons post-stroke as observed in-clinical vs. in-home settings, and 2) map the rate of deterioration of clinically-derived walking improvements, in the home. This methodology has been used to accurately measure gait kinematics in people with stroke as they walk in laboratory, however this study now seeks to use these methods to record people with stroke as they walk in their natural home environments. The ultimate outcome of this project will not only be freely-available video-based workflow modified for home-based gait assessments, but also preliminary data revealing how people with stroke walk in the real world."

In order to assess the concurrent validity of the PSS, the SF-36 (short form) which evaluates the quality of life, and the Patient Satisfaction Scale in Physiotherapy (PSSP) which evaluates patient satisfaction will be used. Scales will be repeated after 15 days to assess test-retest reliability."
NCT02324634,"Stroke is the largest cause of adult disability in the United Kingdom. Loss of hand function, muscle weakness, pain, and joint deformities are persistent and disabling problems for nearly half of all stroke survivors. This can, in part, result from patients not getting adequate therapy targeting the hand and arm in the very early stages of rehabilitation. Previous research has highlighted the importance of early rehabilitation interventions after stroke. Although in stroke patients the damage is to the brain rather than the limbs, muscle wastage (atrophy) can occur soon after stroke through non-use. Muscle atrophy can even occur in those who have retained some degree of active arm movement. Electrical stimulation (ES) is a painless treatment in which small pulses of electrical current from a battery operated portable device are used to activate a paralysed muscle and produce a strong muscle contraction. ES has been shown to increase brain activity and can hence influence the formation of new nerve pathways (known as neuroplasticity) to replace those damaged by stroke. Previous studies have concluded that six weeks of ES to the muscle on the back of the forearm improved the chance of a person recovering arm function. However, as the intensity of treatment was not sufficient to prevent the complications identified in this proposal, the impact of any functional benefit was significantly limited. We plan to build on previous research by training clinical therapists to operate ES devices; starting ES much earlier after stroke; applying a higher intensity treatment to more of the forearm muscles (i.e. both the front and back of the forearm) and providing treatment for a longer period of time than previously carried out. We will evaluate the feasibility of incorporating ES into a patient self-management programme to enable independent use outside of routine therapist led rehabilitation sessions."
NCT05489146,"Upper extremity (UE) paresis or weakness is one of the most frequent impairments after stroke. Despite intense rehabilitation, motor and functional recovery of patients with severe hand impairments is poor. Hence, there is a need for more effective treatments to enhance motor function in patients with severe hand impairments after stroke. Adaptive functional electrical stimulation (FES) appears to be a promising treatment and has the potential to facilitate active movement in individuals with severe impairments post-stroke. In addition, transcranial random noise stimulation (trns) is a widely studied, non-invasive and safe method to enhance the corticomotor excitability in individuals with chronic stroke. However, the effect of combining trns and adaptive FES in patients with severe hand impairments has not been investigated. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether combining trns with FES will enhance hand function in individuals with chronic stroke than FES alone. The investigators predict that combining trns with FES will significantly enhance hand function than FES alone."
NCT05388578,"Although there have been major advances in (personalized) stroke treatment in the last decade, the need for prevention of stroke remains critical. Prevention of recurrent stroke is currently primarily organized through management of cardiovascular risk factors including lifestyle, hypertension and atrial fibrillation (AF). To improve the cardiovascular risk management of stroke patients, more frequent measurements of blood pressure and heart rhythm are essential. In addition, actively engaging the patient with their own recovery could lead to an improved lifestyle. Recent studies have shown telemonitoring of patients can improve care, help with prevention of disease, and reduce healthcare costs, whilst keeping the patient more engaged with their disease.

The LUMC ""Box"" has shown to effectively monitor blood pressure of patients after myocardial infarction with equal results and patient satisfaction rates compared to standard care with less physical contact moments. We plan to use this framework for improving post-stroke care by introducing more frequent blood pressure and heart rhythm measurements. Additionally, we will provide more information around lifestyle improvement and have the patient actively engage with their weight and physical activity.

In this study we will be evaluating the technical feasibility and clinical implementation of the home-based self-measurements using the Box in a post-stroke pilot setting: the Stroke Box.

Both procedures have a high risk of stroke and silent infarction. Gas has been detected in the cerebral vasculature during these procedures and associated with DWI positive lesions on MRI. The hypothesis is that air emboli contribute to stroke and silent infarction. The investigators propose addressing air emboli by flushing the device with carbon dioxide prior to flushing with saline. This is a pilot study comparing standard saline flush alone to carbon dioxide flushing with saline flush."
NCT04019483,"Rationale: Over 20.000 people suffer an ischemic stroke in the Netherlands each year. Large artery occlusions are easy to identify and can be treated with endovascular clot removal. 70% of patient will however suffer from a more distal occlusion resulting in small volume stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Small ischemic lesions are hard to detect with current acute stroke protocols. TIA and small volume stroke patients, are at an increased risk for recurrent stroke, making immediate diagnosis critical. Because thrombo-embolic sources often cause these strokes, identifying and treating the underlying aetiology has the potential to radically lower the risk of recurrence and improve the outcome of these patients.

Objectives: 1) To identify clinical and imaging predictors of recurrent stroke; 2) To improve early detection of small volume stroke with admission computed tomography perfusion (CTP) in patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke with small volume stroke or no ischemia on admission imaging.

Study design: Prospective, multicenter cohort study.

Study population: All patients who visited the University Medical Center (UMC) Utrecht, the Amsterdam University Medical Centers (Amsterdam UMC), location Academic Medical Center (AMC) or the St. Antonius Hospital and who underwent a CT-scan of the brain within 9 hours after onset of stroke symptoms with an age ≥18 years. Within 36 months, 720 patients will be enrolled in the study. Of these patients, 300 patients will be included for the follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study endpoints are: 1) Stroke recurrence rate at 2 years; 2) Presence and volume of acute ischemic lesions on follow-up diffusion weighted imaging MRI."

NCT03702452,"Ischemic stroke is the main cause of disability in the world. More than 70% of stroke patients show various degrees of neural function impairment. Motor rehabilitation in acute phase is beneficial for improving patient's structure and function of corticospinal tract. However, it is difficult to obtain effective rehabilitation during the acute phase of stroke because of the insufficiency of professional rehabilitation therapists in stroke wards in China.The present study is to verify that nursing-directed rehabilitation can compensate for the shortage of professional rehabilitation therapists. Our previous study indicated that nursing-directed motor function rehabilitation provided more obvious effect on stroke patients with a weighted corticospinal tract lesion load (wCST-LL) smaller than 2ml. We assume that implementing rehabilitation nursing based on the wCST-LL can realize nursing-directed, wCST-LL-based precision motor rehabilitation during acute phase of ischemic stroke.The present study is to conduct randomized clinical trial to confirm the effect of nursing-directed precision rehabilitation for motor function in acute stroke patients grouped by wCST-LL, and to evaluate the effect of this precision rehabilitation by using functional scale, and to explore the histopathologic mechanism of the precision rehabilitation nursing by mean of neuroelectrophysiology and neuroimaging examination.

NCT03975218,"Stroke is a growing disease. It is the first pathology responsible for acquired handicap, the second of dementia and the second cause of death in the world. In France, they are the leading cause of death in women and the third cause in men. Sequelae and disabilities also represent a significant financial cost for health insurance.

The early management of the treatment improves the patient's vital and functional prognosis. The ability of the patient to identify the signs of stroke requiring urgent consultation and proper orientation are therefore crucial for further management.

The most common signs that patients must recognize are muscle weakness or sudden paralysis of an arm, leg or half of the body, asymmetry of the face, tingling, numbness of a hemi-body, speech or understanding, loss of vision of an eye or hemifield, disorder of the coordination of a hemi-body. The variety of clinical pictures complicates primary prevention.

In this context, a 2010-2014 National Stroke Action Plan was undertaken with the aim, among other things, of developing information to prevent stroke and to limit its sequelae. In this plan, the attending physician must improve prevention in high-risk patients and be a link between the city and the hospital for follow-up.

Both approaches will feature a web-based computer ""game"" that trains cognitive processing speed, i.e., how quickly individuals process information that they receive through their senses. This training is termed Speed of Processing Training (SOPT). One approach will add (A) in-lab training on everyday activities with important cognitive components and (B) procedures designed to transfer improvements in cognition from the treatment setting to everyday life. This approach is termed Constraint-Induced Cognitive Therapy (CICT). The other approach will add (A) in-lab training on relaxation, healthy nutrition, and healthy sleep and (B) procedures designed to promote integration of these lifestyle changes into everyday life. This approach is termed Brain Fitness-Heath Education Lifestyle Program (BF-HELP).

Both CICT and BF-HELP will involve 35 hours of training. Ten 1-hour sessions of SOPT will be scheduled in the home with training conducted independently by participants. Ten 2.5 hours of in-lab, face-to-face, therapist directed sessions will be scheduled. These sessions will feature a brief period of SOPT; the bulk of the sessions will be committed to in-lab training on the target behaviors and the procedures designed to promote transfer of therapeutic gains to daily life; The set of the latter procedures is termed the Transfer Package.

NCT01812993,"Although the negative impact of sleep apnea on the clinical course of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is well known, data regarding non-invasive ventilation in acute patients are scarce. Several studies showed its tolerability, safety and signals-of-efficacy, yet no controlled randomized sequential phase studies currently exist that aim to establish the efficacy of early non-invasive ventilation in AIS patients. The main hypothesis for this study is that early non-invasive ventilation with automated bilevel positive airway pressure (auto-BPAP) positively affects short-term clinical outcomes in AIS patients. This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, third rater-blinded, parallel-group trial. Patients with AIS with proximal arterial obstruction and clinically suspected sleep apnea will be randomized to standard or standard stroke care plus auto-BPAP. Auto-BPAP will be initiated within 24 hours from stroke onset and performed for a maximum of 48 hours during diurnal and nocturnal sleep. Patients will undergo cardiorespiratory polygraphy between day 3 and 5 to assess sleep apnea. The primary endpoint is any early neurological improvement on the NIHSS at 72 hours from randomization.

NCT03641963,"Space-occupying, malignant middle cerebral artery (M-MCA) infarctions are still one of the most devastating forms of ischemic stroke, with a mortality of up to 80% in untreated patients. It is reported that early hemicraniectomy leads to a substantial decrease in mortality at 6 and 12 months and is likely to improve functional outcome. Thus, this study investigates if non-invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) measuring could represent an objective value to determine the time point to indicate decompressive craniectomy surgery.

However, there are still important questions about the individual indication for decompressive surgery. In consideration of a variable clinical course (some patients develop fatal brain edema early, whereas other patients do not show severe brain swelling for several days), achieving a way to measure, control and predict malignant brain edema formation would be of extremely important value."

NCT00376207,"Decreased insulin sensitivity is and independent risk factor for stroke despite glycemic control. It is known that physical exercise increases insulin sensitivity in healthy subjects. Wether stroke patients can increase insulin sensitivity via physical exercise is not known.

Chronic low-grade inflammation is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Physical exercise has shown to increase IL-6 directly after exercise in untrained subjects. When fitness is increased in each subject then the peak IL-6 concentration after exercise decreases and so does the basal level of IL-6. It is not known whether stroke patients can increase physical activity level to a degree where chronic inflammation are decreased.

This study is designed to evaluate if physical exercise after stroke will increases insulin sensitivity and reduce low-grade chronic inflammation.

Stroke patients have been randomized to intervention with physical exercise or control in the ExStroke pilot trial and followed for 2 years. Using the study population from the ExStroke pilot trail blood samples will be obtained at the last control. Insulin sensitivity can be measured from fasting glucose and insulin using the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA). Interleukin-6, TNF-alfa and CRP is measured to estimate chronic inflammation."

NCT01072032,"Reduced mobility is often a long-term problem facing those who have chronic leg weakness resulting from stroke. Recent innovations in stroke therapy have applied motor learning principles to improve motor skills through regular practice of activities using the weaker limb. Because the ankle provides critical torques for normal walking and mobility function, impairments at the affected ankle pose a major limitation to achieving optimal mobility recovery. To address this we have developed a novel ankle robot (Anklebot) to enhance physical therapy for improving walking and mobility after stroke. This computer controlled device provides assistance when users cannot complete a movement, but will not assist if the user is active.

Motor learning requires active involvement in task-related practice to mediate brain plasticity. While voluntary movement is important to remodel motor control circuits, the brain mechanisms of reward and motivation also can play an important role. Core brain networks involved in reward and motivation increase a person's involvement with their surroundings, to focus attention and to prompt one to approach reward and avoid punishment. This increased involvement and the elevated emotions associated with it have been shown to enhance performance, memory and learning.

The purpose of this study is to investigate responses of brain and motor behavior of stroke patients who use the Anklebot during a 3-week / 3-session/week motor learning based training. These responses are compared to a 3-week delayed entry period in which the participants will perform an at-home walking program of equal time. After the 3-week delayed entry walking program, subjects are divided into low and high reward-feedback groups. The low reward-feedback group receives the Anklebot training with only immediate feedback on target successes, without cumulative scores and with minimal social interaction with the researchers. The high-reward group receives cumulative scores and ongoing social support, are eligible for prizes during each session and at the study's completion. All subjects play the games as noninvasive electroencephalography and electromyography record brain and muscle activity. In addition to analyzing brain information before and after the Anklebot training, ankle motor control and walking functions are also assessed immediately before and after the first and last robotic training sessions."

NCT02601183,"The cerebrovascular diseases can be approximately divided as two types, namely ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Intravenous thrombolysis within 3-4.5 hours is highly recommended for acute ischemic stroke patients. But it's difficult to diagnose the ischemic stroke with the hemorrhagic stroke from the early symptoms and signs. It's with high risk of enlarging the hematoma if the patients with hemorrhagic stroke received the thrombolytic drugs. And time cost by CT or MRI examination is likely to responsible for missing the narrow time window and poor prognosis of stroke patients. Consequently, seeking for a noninvasive, rapid, portable and inexpensive diagnosis method which can sensitively distinguish the stroke type before CT or MRI examination would be very helpful in treating the ischemic stroke patients.

Because of the blockage in the cerebral supply artery, the heat from circulatory system will sharply decrease in infracted hemisphere among the ischemic stroke patients. The reduced brain temperature influenced the temperature on the ipsilateral forehead according to the data of our animal and preliminary clinical trial. In contrast, the temperature of the ipsilateral hemisphere showed a mild increase among the ischemic stroke patients in our preliminary experiment. The difference of the temperature tendency on the ipsilateral forehead has a great chance to be an early physical mark.

In our study, 30 ischemic stroke patients and 30 hemorrhagic stroke patients will be recruited. In the process of recruitment, the patients with acute stroke attack in no more than 4.5 hours will be collected the temperature at the five point without head coverage, including ipsilateral tempora, ipsilateral forehead, galbella, contralateral forehead, and contralateral tempora. Then the stroke would be recruited into the ischemic and hemorrhagic group according to the later CT or MRI results in the hospital. The accuracy and sensibility of early brain temperature in distinguishing stroke type would be tested in comparison with the diagnosis of imaging examination."
NCT02398656,"This trial will enroll patients that have been diagnosed with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke that has occurred within the past 12 hours. Anyone diagnosed with a minor stroke faces the possibility of long-term disability and even death, regardless of treatment. Stroke symptoms such as weakness, difficulty speaking and paralysis may improve or worsen over the hours or days immediately following a stroke. TEMPO-2 is a minor stroke trial for patients presenting within 12 hours of their symptom onset. Patients will be randomized to TNK-tPA or standard of care. In the intervention group TNK-tPA is given as a single, intravenous bolus (0.25mg/Kg) immediately upon randomization. Maximum dose 50mg. The control group will receive antiplatelet agent(s) as decided by the treating physician. Antiplatelet agent(s) choice will be at the treating physician's discretion.

The two groups will have to be similar in terms of demographic variables (age, gender, time since beginning of stroke). A series of parameters will be tested, on one occasion for each participant. The two groups will then be compared to one another."
NCT03924765,"The increased metabolic and biomechanical demands of ambulation limit community mobility in persons with lower limb disability due to neurological damage. There is a critical need for improving the locomotion capabilities of individuals with stroke to increase their community mobility, independence, and health. Robotic exoskeletons have the potential to assist these individuals by increasing community mobility to improve quality of life. While these devices have incredible potential, current technology does not support dynamic movements common with locomotion such as transitioning between different gaits and supporting a wide variety of walking speeds. One significant challenge in achieving community ambulation with exoskeletons is providing an adaptive control system to accomplish a wide variety of locomotor tasks. Many exoskeletons today are developed without a detailed understanding of the effect of the device on the human musculoskeletal system. This research is interested in studying the question of how the control system affects stroke biomechanics including kinematic, kinetics and muscle activation patterns. By optimizing exoskeleton controllers based on human biomechanics and adapting control based on task, the biggest benefit to patient populations will be achieved to help advance the state-of-the-art with assistive hip exoskeletons."
NCT03149705,"Ischemic stroke is the first cause of acquired disability of the adult, the second cause of dementia and the third cause of death in the industrialized countries, what constitutes à major public health issue. Stroke is characterized by a cerebral parenchymal lesion due to an ischemic mechanism (85% of the cases) or hemorrhagic mechanism (15%). For a long time, the only approved treatment was the intravenous thrombolysis (rt-PA). Recently, thrombectomy has proven its superiority in this pathology.

Cohorts of patients with stroke are rare but can be very valuable by their clinical, laboratory and imaging well documented. They are the source of new hypotheses for research or interventions as well as the quality of care assessment tool.

The main objective of this project is to identify new markers: biological and imaging, treatment response and prognosis after ischemic stroke.

Secondary objectives of the HIBISCUS-STROKE cohort are to establish a clinical database, completed by biological samples and by imaging data that can be used in the following areas:

Descriptive epidemiology of ischemic stroke and cerebral reperfusion,
Pharmacoepidemiology and treatments observatory: safety, efficacy, indication of treatment in real life, costs

NCT02596607,"Acute stroke management represents a true medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and urgent treatment. However, only a small percentage of patients access to thrombolysis on time. Various actions have been implemented since 2006 in the Rhone area as part of research projects and of the 2010-2014 national stroke action plan: training of health professionals involved in the stroke management, increase of public awareness through sensibilization campaigns, implementation of telemedicine and increase of the number of hospital beds dedicated to stroke (stroke units beds).

The main objective of the STROKE 69 study is to assess the impact of these actions on intra-hospital acute stroke management times in the Rhône area. The secondary objectives are to assess the impact of these actions on the rate and place of thrombolysis, the rate of post- thrombolysis hemorrhage, the rate of thrombectomies, mortality in the acute phase, at 3 and 12 months, the level of disability at 3 and 12 months, pre-hospital times, the number of calls to SAMU centre 15 (French mobile emergency medical services, equivalent to 911) and management channels.

The investigator will perform a prospective cohort study between 06/11/2015 and 06/06/2016 and data will be compared to data collected in a previous cohorts study, the AVC-69 cohort study (Porthault Chatard et al, Int J Stroke. 2012 Oct;7(7):E13), between 06/11/2006 and 06/06/2007, before the implementation of the actions in the Rhône area.

The cohort will be constituted of all consecutive patients treated for a stroke suspicion by the Rhône SAMU centre 15, or in one of the emergency unit or stroke unit of the Rhône area, and presenting a symptom-onset (the last time the patient was seen without deficit) less than 24 hours.

After collecting data in the acute phase, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) will be followed for 12 months after their inclusion by telephone calls at 3 and 12 months to assess the level of disability and mortality.

NCT00413595,"New studies indicate that in about 1 - 2 percent of the younger stroke patients the cause could have been an undiagnosed genetic disease, the so called Fabry disease. In this case certain fat molecules are not digested and broken down by the body - but remain in the cells. These fat molecules build up to dangerous levels, which start to damage the body, because they accumulate e.g. in the walls of the blood vessels. This accumulation in the blood vessels of the whole body may cause life-threatening malfunctions in the brain, inducing a stroke.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the stroke rehabilitation of Fabry patients during different therapeutic standard approaches for stroke and for Fabry disease (if any). During this study, stroke patients with Fabry disease will be monitored in greater detail to determine whether the differences in treatment are significant for patient recovery and on what they depend."
NCT00407667,"Transcranial galvanic stimulation (tDCS) seems to promote motor recovery after stroke by stimulating (anodal) or inhibiting (cathodal) neural circuits in the brain. In the treatment of severe arm paresis after stroke, robot-assisted arm training (AT) proved to be effective, but nevertheless only a few patients could use their affected hand functionally in daily life after robot training. Therefore the present study intends to combine both approaches, tDCS + AT, applied at the same time every day for six weeks. The study has three treatment arms, two groups will receive the tDCS, either anodal of the lesioned or cathodal of the non-lesioned hemisphere. The anodal stimulation is expected to facilitate the activity of the arm motor area of the lesioned side directly, while the cathodal stimulation of the non-lesioned hemisphere is expected to facilitate the lesioned side indirectly by decreasing inhibitory inputs. The third group will receive a sham-stimulation. All patients will work with the AT simultaneously to the tDCS, respectively sham-tDCS."

NCT00418275,To evaluate the safety profiles of HTU-PA in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
NCT00417898,"This study will determine the safety of 500mg of aspirin added to IV TPA at standard doses to prevent re-occlusion of cerebral vessels after successful reperfusion. In ischemic stroke brain arteries are occluded either by an embolus originating in the heart or large vessels leading to the brain or by a process of acute thrombosis of the cerebral arteries over a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. Rupture of the plaque exposes thrombogenic elements within the plaque and leads to accumulation and activation of platelets and induction of the clotting cascade eventually leading to acute thrombosis and occlusion of the artery. TPA is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat heart and brain problems caused by blockage of arteries. It activates plasminogen and leads to disintegration of the thrombus/embolus. It is effective only if begun within 3 to 4.5 hours of onset of the stroke because of potential deleterious side effects including life threatening symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) when the drug is administered outside of this time window.

Reperfusion of the ischemic brain (i.e. timely opening of the occluded artery) with TPA is associated with improved outcome. However, in about 33% of patients that have successfully reperfused after TPA the artery re-occludes within the first few hours resulting in worsening neurological symptoms and worse functional outcome. This re-occlusion is speculated to result from re-thrombosis over an existing ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. This is explained by the relatively short half life of TPA leaving the exposed ruptured plaque intact which leads to re-activation of platelets and clotting factors and re-thrombosis. Thus, we hypothesize that the addition of an antiplatelet agent to TPA would result in lower rates of re-occlusion after AIS. The FDA approved TPA for patients with AIS but discouraged the concomitant use of anti-platelet or anti-thrombotic drugs for the first 24hours after administration of TPA because of concerns that such therapy may result in increased rates of intracerebral hemorrhage. Aspirin is a well known platelet anti-aggregant that works by inhibition of cycloxygenase 1 and reduction in thromboxane A levels. It has a rapid onset of action and additional potential beneficial anti-inflammatory effects in patients with AIS. The international stroke study showed that acute treatment of stroke patients with 500mg of aspirin is safe and feasible and results in better outcome. Furthermore, the drug was safe in these circumstances with an ICH rate of only .

Therefore, the purpose of this clinical trial is to examine the safety and efficacy of the combination of aspirin with rt-TPA in patients with AIS."

NCT00422474,"After acute stroke, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) is impaired. This impaired acute stage BRS has been reported to be predictive of worsen outcome years after stroke in general. However, it is not very clear if the impaired acute stroke BRS would actually persist months after the acute stage. It is also not clear that such change, if any, would correlate with the functional outcome or prognosis after stroke.

The trial is to investigate the longitudinal time course of BRS after ischemic stroke up to the 6th month post stroke and to see if there is any correlation of the changes in BRS with the functional outcome parameters using NIHSS and mRS scores throughout this period."

NCT01112488,"Currently there is a lot of literatures on stroke rehabilitation and post-discharge therapy. However, there are few evidence based guidelines on patient engagement after stroke in the post-rehabilitation community phase. There is evidence from stroke studies that stroke patients with mild to moderate disability, discharged early from an acute hospital unit can be rehabilitated in the community by an interdisciplinary stroke rehabilitation team and attain similar functional outcomes when compared to patients receiving in-patient rehabilitation. There is strong evidence that additional hospital based outpatient therapy improves short term functional outcomes compared to routine care over short term. Although meta-analyses have examined the efficacy of self management education programs, the interpretation of such reviews is limited by heterogeneity in populations and interventions and the limited range of outcomes measured. Few randomized controlled trials have found a reduction in health service utilization, such as incidences of hospitalization (in patients with chronic lung disease, heart disease, stroke and arthritis) as a direct outcome of attending an education program. For self-management support to be effective and sustainable in the community, it is postulated that initiatives simultaneously focus on supporting patients to engage in self management and equipping health care professionals with the necessary resources to assist them."

NCT01112813,"Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and the third leading cause of death in Canada. Most stroke survivors live with residual impairments that diminish independence and quality of life. This may include vascular cognitive impairment (loss of ability to plan, think and reason) which can lead to dementia and loss of mental and functional independence.

The current treatment to reduce stroke induced brain tissue injury is limited to thrombolytics (clot busters), a therapy useful only if given in the first hours following stroke. One major new approach aims to reduce cell death after stroke by targeting the ongoing tissue loss initiated by the stroke. The tissue can be maintained by interfering with later neurochemical processes that are activated by stroke, potentially through activating natural substances in the brain that help survival and growth of nerve cells (""neurotrophic"" factors).

The recent recognition of lithium as a neurotrophic agent has generated the first studies of lithium treatment for managing brain diseases. Clinically, lithium has now been shown to increase brain gray matter volume in bipolar patients. This effect is potentially important in stroke because gray matter loss has been implicated in the development of cognitive impairment after stroke, a result of the series of brain processes that are activated by lack of oxygen due to stroke. Our primary objective is to examine the effects of lithium on total brain gray matter volume in the post-stroke population, as measured by volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the hope that lithium may increase gray matter volume in post-stroke patients and lead to greater cognitive and functional rehabilitation. This study will provide valuable information on the tolerability of lithium, and its effects on clinical outcomes relevant to stroke, providing the information needed for designing a large-scale clinical trial."

NCT00474292,"This study will examine how the brain rewires itself to make up for the lack of movement many people with stroke experience. It will try to determine if the rewiring differs depending on the location of the stroke and the amount of time since the stroke occurred. For some stoke patients, weakness may persist, while others recover completely after time. It is not known which parts of the brain are involved in the recovery of different types of stroke and if the type of stroke affects recovery.

People 18 years of age and older who have had subacute thromboembolic or hemorrhagic stroke more than 3 months before enrolling may participate in this study.

Participants come to the NIH Clinical Center three times every 2 years for up to 10 years. At the first visit, patients have a neurological examination and perform tests of motor abilities such as lifting small objects, turning cards, using a spoon, stacking checkers and lifting cans during a short period of time as rapidly as possible.

At the second visit, subjects have structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. During the scan, the subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the cylinder, wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking noises associated with the scanning process. Total scan time is about 30 minutes

At the third visit, subjects perform some simple movement tasks during functional MRI (fMRI) scans. The procedure is the same as with structural MRI, except that subjects are asked to perform simple movement tasks in the scanner. Before the fMRI scans, electrodes are attached to the subject's arms and legs to monitor muscle activity (surface electromyography). Total scan time is about 1.5 hours. Movement tasks might include pinching a force-measuring instrument with the fingers, pressing different keys on a keyboard as fast as possible, inserting pegs into small holes on a board, lifting weights, flipping cards or similar activities."

NCT00506818,"Cognitive and emotional symptoms are often seen in the acute phase of a stroke. The prevalence of such symptoms later and the mechanisms explaining the symptoms are not fully known. The causes of poststroke dementia are likely to be multifactorial (Cerebrovascular Diseases 2006). The investigators want to include all patients with first ever stroke without significant cognitive decline prior to the stroke (IQCODE cut-off 3,7) and follow them up for one year. At baseline we will make stroke classifications, measure neurological deficits according to NIHSS, evaluate cognitive and emotional function and make registrations of vascular risk factors, including precerebral color duplex scan with measurement of IMT in CCA. The investigators will then randomize the patients into multifactorial vascular-risk-factor-intervention in the hospital or care as usual in the primary health care. 8-12 months after stroke onset, survivors will undergo new examinations to evaluate neurological, cognitive and emotional functions, as well as MRI and SPECT."

NCT01115348,"Stroke is the most common cause for motor disability in the grown-up population in the Western world. In Sweden > 80 % are above 65 years of age at onset (1).Areas in the brain, controlling the movement in the upper extremity (UE) are often damaged at a stroke, which leads to impaired function. This impairment of the UE often leads to limitations in activities of daily living and reductions in the level of social activities; therefore, interventions that will improve function are needed to reduce the consequences for the person living with stroke. The time course of recovery of the UE is not clear and therefore the optimal timing of the intervention for the person and its content (ways of intervention) uncertain.

The investigators have developed objective assessments of motor performance with new technology (kinematic analysis and virtual reality with haptics). Since having an impaired UE often results in reduced capacity in daily living and social activities, this might lead to decreased participation. To complement the traditional focus on body function, there is a need for assessments of the person's activity level and participation, as well as self-perceived function.

The results from this study will lay the ground for an intervention study focusing on improved function in the upper extremity."
NCT02080624,"Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a rare congenital neuro-cutaneous disorder considered as a rare or orphan disease. SWS is characterized by a capillary vascular malformation (CM) localized on the skin of the face, eyes and central nervous system. Given the localization and the extent of the CM, children with SWS are particularly prone to developing severe psychological problems. The standard treatment for CM is pulsed dye laser (PDL) although in these cases whitening of the lesion is rarely achieved.

NCT04441177,"Compared to conventional rehabilitation therapy, the full-immersive commercial game (CG) system, in the form of available video game, could safely provide more positive effect on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and motor function in post-stroke patients.

The study aims to perform the research from 2019/7/1 to 2021/6/30 and enrolls a total of 80 participants. Stroke participants are recruited from the rehabilitation ward of CGMH hospital.

The inclusion criteria are (a) first-time unilateral cerebral stroke, (b) stroke onset less or equal to 1 year, (c) admission to the rehabilitation ward, (d) ages 20-80 years, (e) spasticity of paretic arm ≤ grade 2 in the Modified Ashworth Scale, and (f) no active medical problems such as fever, pneumonia, or scabies.

NCT01897025,"Stroke is the most common cause of adult disability. Current treatments for functional loss of the upper extremity post-stroke remain limited in efficacy, particularly for those with moderate to severe impairment.

Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for motor recovery post-stroke, a technique of neuromodulation. Motor imagery is effective to enhance motor recovery, with activation of neural pathways similar to that of motor execution. This treatment is accessible to more severely impaired stroke survivors. Our previous studies have demonstrated feasibility and efficacy of motor imagery-based brain computer interface (MI-BCI) for post-stroke motor impairment, in which motor imagery is detected by surface EEG and translated to execution of the target movement with the aid of an arm robot (MIT-Manus).

In this study, we investigate the feasibility of combining robot-assisted MI-BCI training, with tDCS to facilitate post-stroke motor recovery in moderate to severe impairment of upper extremity function. We hypothesise that both tDCS-BCI and sham-BCI will improve motor function in the stroke-affected arm; but that tDCS-BCI will be more effective than sham-BCI. Our secondary aim is to gain insight into the neurophysiological mechanism by comparing the cortical excitability changes following sham-BCI vs tDCS-BCI, using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

We will conduct a randomized, double-blinded study with MI-BCI combined with tDCS (tDCS-BCI) vs MI-BCI combined with sham-tDCS (sham tDCS-BCI). Subjects will undergo 10 sessions of tDCS each lasting 20 minutes, followed by 40 minutes of robot-assisted MI-BCI training at each session. Primary outcome will be functional ability measured by upper extremity component of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment. Secondary outcome measures will be the Box & Block Test, Modified Ashworth Score (measuring spasticity), grip strength and measures of brain activity including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures including functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).

This study will be important to develop a new and effective treatment (tDCS-BCI) for post-stroke motor impairment."

NCT02017574,"Stroke is one of the leading causes of chronic disability in Veterans. Stroke is associated with significant loss of mobility, increased risk of falling, cardiovascular disease, depression and neuro-cognitive impairment. These deficits negatively impact the independent completion of the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Task-oriented training has emerged as the dominant therapeutic intervention in the rehabilitation of chronic stroke victims. The effectiveness of these interventions may be enhanced through facilitation of implicit knowledge rather than explicit knowledge. Specifically, implicit learning increases retention and improves transfer of the improved motor function outside of the lab environment. Moreover, implicit motor control reduces the burden imposed on cognitive resources as the skill is performed automatically (i.e. do not have to 'think' about it). The amount and type of feedback individuals receive while learning a new task (or relearning in the case of rehabilitation) has been shown to influence the type of learning (i.e. implicit or explicit). Thus the purpose of the current study is to determine the effect of different types of feedback during motor learning on the learning type and the resultant impact on functional outcomes (i.e. motor performance, retention, and cognitive workload) in chronic stroke patients."

NCT00542256,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether a painless and noninvasive procedure called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with a method of physical therapy called constraint-induced movement therapy improves motor function in patients with chronic stroke. Research in healthy subjects has shown that when tDCS is combined with motor learning tasks, there is an increase in learning as compared to motor learning tasks only. The tDCS procedure sessions will be compared to sham (fake) procedure sessions, which is also called placebo stimulation. This study is double blind, which means neither the subjects nor researchers analyzing motor function will know if participants are receiving real tDCS stimulation or placebo. Only the person performing the procedure will know which one participants are receiving. Only by comparing the tDCS procedure to a sham (placebo) procedure can we understand if the tDCS actually improves motor function.

We hypothesize that tDCS will enhance the effects of constraint-induced movement therapy on motor recovery in chronic stroke patients."

NCT04800809,"Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) occurs in 300,000 newborns per year in the world, with 150,000 affected births in Nigeria, alone. With improvement in survival for children with SCA in both high- and low-resource countries, neurological morbidity is an emerging significant public health challenge, particularly in countries with a high rate of sickle cell disease (SCD). Both silent cerebral infarcts (SCI) and overt strokes result in significant neurological morbidity and premature death. Five NIH-funded randomized controlled trials (RCT) demonstrated that regular blood transfusion or hydroxyurea therapy are efficacious treatments for primary and secondary stroke prevention in children with SCA. Despite the observation that at least 99% of children with SCA in high-resource settings reach adulthood, and approximately 60% of adults will experience one or more strokes (~50% with SCI and ~10% with overt strokes) and the high disease-burden in Nigeria, the prevalence and incidence rates of new and recurrent stroke (overt and silent strokes)have not been collected systematically in children and young adults (16-25 years old) with SCA. In the last decade, there has been growing use of stroke registries in economically advanced nations, particularly for epidemiological purposes of trend analysis, clinical effectiveness, compliance to guidelines, assessment of implementation, adoption of novel techniques, and quality improvement process. For the first time in clinical centers in Nigeria, the Investigators will conduct an observational epidemiological study to document the prevalence and track the incidence of new and recurrent strokes in children and young adults with SCD. The Investigators will create a stroke registry referred to as the Afolabi Stroke Registry for Children and Young Adults with Sickle Cell Disease in Nigeria.

Patients with less severe conditions can be diagnosed and safely left at home. The objectives of this project are to investigate whether the Advanced Mobile Stroke Unit compared to a normal ambulance enables more accurate triage of patients (treatment at home vs hospital vs specialist vs A&E). The Advanced Mobile Stroke Unit ambulance will be used in a random order of weeks and this will be compared to weeks with normal ambulances.

NCT04992195,"Safe and effective severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines may reduce the transmission of and achieve population immunity against the COVID-19 pandemic, which accounted for more than 3.75million deaths worldwide. With World Health Organization's (WHO) effort on ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, vaccination rate may increase in the near future.

On the other hand, vaccination hesitancy has emerged as a major hindrance on the global vaccination campaigns in certain areas due to safety concerns, social factors, and public health policies. For instance, a recent survey conducted in Hong Kong showed a low vaccine acceptance rate of 37%. Long-term safety concerns and post-vaccination events relayed by the social media maybe reasons for vaccination hesitancy. Among which, cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) after vaccination were one of the most frequently reported post-vaccination events. These reports ranged from ischemic strokes in elderly patients with multiple cardiovascular co-morbidities, to hemorrhage strokes in otherwise ""young-and-fit"" adults. While many of these events were investigated by the COVID-19 immunization expert committee, an important premise to address the apprehension of CVA after vaccination is the provision of evidence-based information of the impact of COVID-19 vaccines on brain health.

In this prospective, longitudinal, observational study, we aim to elucidate the relationship between COVID-19 vaccines and cerebrovascular health in healthy citizens in a population-based cohort."
NCT03300141,"The goal of this research study is to increase understanding of error augmentation by applying it to visual feedback during motion tracking with a Leap Motion device - a recently developed optical hand tracking tool - and the LookingGlass - a new, portable virtual reality environment.

In conjunction with the Leap, large, three dimensional work spaces can provide an immersive and virtual augmented environment for rehabilitation. Previously, experiments have utilized the Virtual Reality Robotic and Optical Operations Machine (VRROOM) to create such visually immersive environments. The Robotics lab as part of the Arms and Hands Lab on the 22nd floor of the Shirley Ryan Abilitylab has developed a portable version of this system, which is more compact and clinic-compatible. Combining this visual 3D system with the Leap creates a novel, more capable apparatus for studying error augmentation.

This research study will have 3 different arms: 1.) a healthy group of individuals (Healthy Arm), 2.) a group of stroke survivors within 8 months of stroke (Acute Arm), and 3.) a group of stroke survivors that had their stroke more than 8 months ago (Chronic Arm).

Each Arm will use the Leap motion tracker and the Looking Glass to participate in a reaching intervention. The healthy arm will only participate in 1 visit with an intervention with and without error augmented visual feedback. The Acute Arm and the Chronic Arm will both have 2 groups: 1.) Error Augmented Visual Feedback group and 2.) Non-Augmented or Veridical Visual Feedback group.

The Chronic Arm will have a structured intervention and evaluation protocol: Study staff will administer outcome assessments at 3 time points: a.) prior to intervention, b.) post intervention, and c.) 2 months after the conclusion of intervention. Intervention will occur over the span of 6-8 weeks with the goal of 3 1-hour sessions per week.

The Acute Arm will have a less structured intervention that will occur while the participant is an inpatient at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. Study staff will administer outcome assessments at at least 2 time points: a.) prior to intervention, b.) post intervention just prior to discharge from Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. Between initial and post intervention evaluations, midpoint evaluations will take place at a maximum of once per week if the participant's schedule, activity tolerance, and length of stay allows. Intervention will consist of 1-hour sessions occurring according to the availability of the participant at the rate of no more than 2 sessions in a 24 hour period.

Investigators hope to investigate these questions:

Can the movement of healthy individuals be characterized with error augmented visual feedback and veridical visual feedback?

Will error augmented visual feedback or veridical visual feedback result in greater movement ability improvement?

Investigators hypothesize that in the Chronic Arm, those what trained with error-augmented visual feedback will have improved movement ability compared to those who trained with veridical visual feedback.

Is treatment with the looking glass and leap system feasible with an inpatient population?

Investigators hypothesize that this treatment will be feasible for an inpatient population."

NCT03376893,"Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a rare disease occurring in an estimated 100,000 individuals, often poor and underserved, in the US. Silent and overt strokes contribute significantly to morbidity in adults with SCD, resulting in functional impairment, challenges with school and job performance, and premature death. Five NIH-funded randomized controlled trials have identified therapies to prevent silent and overt strokes in children with SCD, including monthly blood transfusion therapy (for preventing initial and recurrent strokes) and hydroxyurea (for preventing initial strokes). Despite the observation that at least 99% of children with SCD in high-income countries reach adulthood, and approximately 60% of adults will experience one or more strokes (~50% with silent strokes and ~10% with overt strokes), no stroke trials have established therapeutic approaches for adults with SCD. For adults with SCD, inadequate evidence-based guidelines exist for secondary stroke prevention strategies. Applying stroke prevention strategies in children may not be effective for stroke prevention in adults with SCD, particularly given the high rate of co-morbidities. Identifying subgroups of adults with SCD and higher incidence coupled with the contribution of established stroke risk factors in the general population (smoking, diabetes, obesity, renal disease) will provide the requisite data required for the first-ever phase III clinical trials focused on secondary stroke prevention in adults."

Rehabilitation of walking ability contributes to these costs. To ""walk again"" is the number one stated goal for Veterans who have had a stroke. Teaching patients post-stroke to use their weak leg while they are regaining walking function and to not compensate by over-using their strong leg is necessary to restore safe, efficient walking ability. This project will determine if providing biofeedback (an audible tone) from pressure-sensitive shoe insole sensors, that encourage use of the weaker leg during walking training, in addition to therapists' feedback, will help Veterans regain use of their weak leg, improve their endurance and improve their balance when walking in challenging environments."
NCT05335772,"The loss of upper-limb motor functioning due to ischemic stroke has a negative impact on quality of life of patients. Action Observation Treatment (AOT), recently developed based on the mirror mechanism functioning, has proved effective in promoting plasticity into the motor system, ultimately boosting the motor recovery. The use of virtual reality further empowers the effectiveness of AOT, making the visual experience more first-person, and thus more realistic. A complete picture of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AOT effectiveness is lacking to date, including the neuroradiological and biohumoral markers modulated by AOT, and their role in predicting the clinical outcome. Starting from these premises, the investigators propose a study aiming at evaluating the AOT effectiveness in post-stroke patients, and at identifying the biomarkers indexing the motor recovery process.

Sixty patients affected by ischemic stroke will be enrolled at Humanitas Clinical and Research Center IRCCS (ICH) Stroke Unit will be included and randomized in the following groups:

VR-AOT: experimental group, observing actions in virtual reality
VR-LO: control groups, observing a matched dose of videos depicting landscapes in virtual reality.

Clinical, neuroimaging and biohumoral evaluations, performed at Screening (Ts), Basal visit (T0), end-of-treatment (T1), 2 months follow up (FU-2), will include the following endpoints: Fugl-Meyer upper extremity motor scale (FM-UE); Nine-hole-peg test; Box and block test; Modified Ashworth scale; MRC; Pain Numeric-rating-scale; Functional Independence measure.

Patients will undergo treatment sessions for 6 weeks (5 days/week). VR-AOT patients will observe in virtual reality -rehearse and execute specific upper limb motor task belonging to activities of daily living. VR-LO participants will observe virtually explorable landscapes lasting for a matched duration. Then, participants will be asked to actively perform the same set of hand actions requested to VR-AOT experimental groups.

An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis will be performed, using rmANOVA, minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in clinical outcomes, and chi-square test. For the primary endpoints, a two-arms rmANOVA with time as within-subject factor (3 levels: T0, T1, FU2) and group (VR-AOT vs VR-LO) as between-subjects factor will be conducted. The same approach will be adopted for secondary outcome measures. Subsequently, the effect of clinical, neuroradiological and biohumoral baseline features will be tested as regressors on the primary outcome variations via linear or ranked regression models. Significance will be set at 5%, and adjusted for MC."

NCT05318586,"Stroke is of high morbidity and mortality, and surviving patients are often unable to take care of themselves because of severe motor dysfunction. The brain has plasticity, and makes adaptive changes after stroke, resulting in the reorganization and compensation of neural networks. However, the muscle tone of some patients will significantly increase during the recovery process, which affects the rehabilitation effect. Neuromodulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have been widely used to promote brain network remodeling after stroke. The investigators attempted to evaluate the motor brain network characteristics of spastic patients by fNIRS, and used the most active brain regions as rTMS stimulation regions to evaluate the improvement effect of this individualized treatment on post-stroke spasticity."
NCT05224973,"Swallowing disorders are a common consequence of stroke. After stroke, some patients retain a dysphagia responsible for an alteration of the quality of life, respiratory diseases and a degradation of the general health status.

The oral phase of the swallowing involves a significant control of the various intraoral organs. These allow the formation of the bolus, its propulsion, and the emptying of the oral cavity after swallowing. Precise and coordinated mobility of the tongue, lips and mandible is essential during this time. During the speech therapy after a stroke, targeted analytical training, coupled with passive stimulations of the swallowing reflex, is typically used.

Previous studies have shown a functional link between fine manual motor skills and oral motor skills, particularly during child development. Little data are available for adult subjects. A pilot study is therefore needed before a larger scale comparative study can be considered. Our hypothesis is that there is a functional link between digital and oral motor areas that could, through co-activation during rehabilitation sessions, promote the recovery of swallowing disorders after stroke."

It is a fan-like wide muscle that connects to the inferior angle of the scapula and ribs, adheres to the anterior surface of the proximal humerus and continues with aponeurosis of the contralateral Gluteus Maximus below. The activation of the LD muscle during the functional reach activity, which we use most frequently in daily living activities, affects the upper extremity and trunk movements. Therefore it is important muscle that affects the quality of movement.

During sitting activity, they will be required to reach three different distances in the sagittal and scapular plane: arm length, 125% of the arm length and end point where it can reach the modified functional reach test. During the activity, electromyography (EMG) activation of latissimus dorsi, anterior deltoid and erector spina muscles will be examined with electromyographic device.

Hypothesis originating from the investigation:

H1: Latissimus dorsi muscle segments show different activation during functional reach activity.

H2: Activation of latissimus dorsi muscle segments is affected by reaching direction during functional reach activity.

H3: Activation of latissimus dorsi muscle segments is affected by reaching distance during functional reach activity."

The overall aim of this study is to find a cost-effective solution to facilitate patient-tailored rehabilitation that improves daily and social activities and health-related quality of life for persons discharged from the acute care after stroke. We have recently developed a novel digital graphic tool, Rehabkompassen®, which based on patient-reported outcome measurements captures the patient's complex health status after stroke.

Here, this tool will be used in a parallel, open-label, 2-arm prospective and multicenter pragmatic randomized controlled trial between 2022-2026. All participants (n = 1106) will be randomized according to permuted block design; and receive a usual care without (control group, n = 553) or with (intervention group, n = 553) Rehabkompassen®, within 3-month after stroke.

NCT02398734,"SONOBIRDIE Trial is a randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled study designed for a demonstration of the safety and effectiveness of sonolysis (continual transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring) in reduction of risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), brain infarctions and cognitive decline using a 2-MHz diagnostic probe with a maximal diagnostic energy on the reduction of risk of brain infarctions by the activation of endogenous fibrinolytic system during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with ≥ 70% symptomatic or asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis.

The sample size is based on an expected 2.5% reduction of ischemic stroke, TIA, and death during the 30-day postoperative period in the sonolysis group (estimated prevalence, 1.5 %) compared to the control group (estimated prevalence, 4 %). Pre-study calculations showed that a minimum of 746 patients in each group is needed to reach a significant difference with an alpha value of 0.05 (two-tailed) and a beta value of 0.8 assuming that 10 % would be lost to follow-up or refuse to participate in the study.

Consecutive patients will be assigned to the sonolysis or control group by a computer-generated 1:1 randomization. In patients randomized into sonolysis group, middle cerebral artery segment in a depth of 55 mm will be continuously monitored during intervention using a diagnostic 2-MHz TCD probe with a maximal diagnostic energy.

In patients randomized into control group, the TCD probe will be fixed in a required position using a special helmet as in sonolysis group patients, but middle cerebral artery segment in a depth of 55 mm will be only localized using a diagnostic 2-MHz TCD probe with a maximal diagnostic energy and the TCD monitoring will be stopped afterwards.

Confirmation of the investigators hypothesis that sonothrombolysis is able to activate endogenous fibrinolytic system during CEA with consecutive reduction of ischemic stroke, TIA or death, and the number and volume of brain infarcts, can lead to the increase of the safety of CEA in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis. The investigators can presume that up to 50% of patients indicated for CEA can be treated using these methods in the future."

NCT05133232,"Stroke is a major cause of adult long term disability and the fourth leading cause of death and affects 1·8/1000 persons in Singapore. Post-stroke functional recovery of upper limb is poor with 80% of stroke survivors having some upper limb disability during the acute to subacute phase after stroke. Early rehabilitation is paramount for enhancing the survival and independence of stroke patients and inadequate supervised therapy hours is closely associated with poor rehabilitation outcome. However, high intensity and high repetition therapies, which facilitates neuroplasticity, have historically had a poor uptake because it is manpower intensive and places a high demand on stroke patients, many of whom cannot cope. High fatigue and sustained levels of effort are also generally perceived as placing the patient at risk if done at home without trained supervision.

Robotic rehabilitation system can provide high-intensity, repetitive, task-specific, interactive treatment of the impaired upper limb and can serve as an objective and reliable means of monitoring patient progress.

Stroke subjects also have a wide spectrum of disability resulting in unconscious co-contractions and compensatory muscle use. Although these disability elements are widely acknowledged to be present, technological tools for identifying and quantifying these are missing. This technology gap affects the optimization of therapy and the patients' understanding of their condition.

This study aims:

To investigate the feasibility and efficacy of using the SynPhNe device outside of conventional therapy time, compared with conventional occupational therapy alone, on hand motor function in acute and subacute stroke patients;
To evaluate the feasibility of the use of SynPhNe by acute and subacute stroke patients with minimized supervision;
To investigate subject and staff perceptions in terms of usability and benefit of the device;
To study clinical outcomes, EEG, EMG and TMS changes over the course of the study;
To compare the cost-benefit of SynPhNe therapy on inpatients with standard care.

SynPhNe therapy will have added benefit compared to conventional occupational therapy alone on hand motor function in acute and subacute stroke patients;
SynPhNe can be used with minimal supervision by acute and subacute stroke patients so that the efficiency of rehabilitation is increased;
SynPhNe therapy is a cost-effective inpatient rehabilitation option."

NCT02328573,The study will focus on the impact of communal singing on patients with stroke and their personal caregivers. Forty post-stroke patients will be randomly assigned to two groups: the first group of 20 stroke survivors and their caregivers (up to 40 total participants) will receive 6 months (approximately 24 sessions) of music therapy. The second control groups of 20 stroke survivors and their caregivers will receive standard post-stroke care
NCT02879123,"This trial aims at collecting standardized data concerning the early neurological clinical recovery of patients, 3 months after endovascular treatment of an acute ischemic stroke.

NCT04144530,"Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability. A major unresolved problem in MRI-based stroke assessment is to relate image features to brain function in a way that can properly guide stratification for treatment and rehabilitation. This requires extracting meaningful and reproducible models of brain function from stroke images, a daunting task severely hindered by the great variability of lesion frequency and pattern. Large datasets are imperative to uncover possible lesion-function relationships.

In this project the investigators will create a large database of acute strokes MRIs. The investigators will retrospectively archive an estimated 3,000 MRIs of patients with acute stroke, acquired at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, 2009-2019. This dataset will include 1.5 and 3 Tesla scans, diverse protocols and sequences (e.g., diffusion and perfusion weighted images (DWI/b0, PWI), T1, T2, FLAIR, susceptibility weighted images), with typical clinical low voxel resolution (4-7 mm3). Lesions will be initially delineated on DWI/b0, the most informative MRI sequence for acute stroke. After anonymization and defacing, two trained evaluators will perform the manual lesion segmentation. Two expert neuroradiologists will create consensual structured radiological reports with information about stroke type and location according to different criteria (e.g., 34 brain structures and 11 vascular territories). The investigators will also archive structured information from discharge (demographics, laboratory, and neurological evaluation of patients, including NIH stroke scale and modified Rankin scale, mRS), as well as the 90-days follow-up mRS."
NCT02325427,"This study is to investigate changes in brain activities in acute stroke patients , and to correlate findings with clinical outcome measures. Another aim of the study is to investigate whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could improve motor function in subjects with poor brain activity after stroke. The brain activity will be measured by single and paired pulse TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation). The study hypothesizes that:

The neural mechanisms employed in patients who have different response to TMS stimulation are different. It is hypothesized that patients with no response upon TMS stimulation might have poorer motor function outcome, compared with patients with response upon TMS stimulation.
The result of clinical outcome measures is related with TMS measurement.
tDCS intervention is beneficial to subjects with poor brain activity. Clinical outcome measures will include a battery of upper limb motor tests such as upper extremity component of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Modified Ashworth scale for spasticity, box and block test, and manual muscle testing. Clinical outcome and TMS measurement will be assessed at within 2 weeks, 4-6 weeks and at 6 months post-stroke."
NCT00612300,"The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of an automatic gait trainer (Lokomat) handled by physical therapists compared with categorized gait training by physical therapists in ambulatory stroke patients. Gait speed, gait distance and gait symmetry are used to evaluate study effects.

Hypotheses: 1) The Lokomat improves stroke patients gait speed, distance and symmetry more than categorized gait training."
NCT01845441,"Dexmedetomidine is a unique sedative medication able to provide sedation without causing respiratory depression and maintaining neurological functions.

NCT05423119,Clinical predictors of rehabilitation-induced arm recovery after stroke are still missing since literature provides evidence mainly on the spontaneous recovery path. This longitudinal cohort study aims to identify neurophysiological and behavioural features able to predict arm recovery and how it can change according to provided rehabilitation.
NCT00613522,"Stroke is the third leading cause of death in industrialized countries and the first cause of handicap in adults. Several stroke risk factors were identified such as high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia or cardiac arrhythmias. Sleep respiratory disorders have been found to be frequent among patients with stroke. Among them obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome seems to be the most important due to its association with high blood pressure and atrial fibrillation.

Stroke can be responsible of central apneas, therefore the differential diagnosis between central apneas and pure OSA after stroke is sometimes difficult. The misidentification of OSA can explain the poor tolerance of CPAP treatment by these patients. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the association between pre-stroke OSA syndrome OSA diagnosed on specific scales and confirmed by polygraphic studies and stroke occurrence."
NCT00629655,"The spinal cord is a very important part of the central nervous system. fMRI can be applied to observe functional status of the human spinal cord.

NCT00624000,"Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States, responsible for 158,488 deaths in 1998 (American Heart Association). Nationwide, each year, an estimated 600,000 to 750,000 people suffer a new or recurrent stroke. Cerebral infarction comprises 80% of all strokes and is the result of a complex series of cellular metabolic events that occur rapidly after interruption of blood flow to a region of the brain. The extent of the brain damage is dependent on the duration and severity of the cerebral ischemia. Acute thrombus formation or migration is the principal cause of blood flow interruption in at least 75% of cerebral infarctions. In several animal models of focal cerebral ischemia, restoration of cerebral blood flow within two to six hours after initial occlusion has been associated with smaller volumes of cerebral infarction and improved functional outcome. An effective way of dissolving the thrombus is by administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator or Activase (Alteplase, rt-PA), which promotes the proteolytic action of plasmin from plasminogen at the site of a clot. In this study, the drug, Activase, will be administered in subjects with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) intravenously (IV) or by local intra-arterial (IA) injection. The use of the intravenous administration within 3 hours of stroke symptom onset is FDA approved whereas the intra-arterial administration, despite evidence of potential benefit, is not currently FDA approved. Although not FDA approved, this study will evaluate the effectiveness of IA thrombolysis with Activase, used in AIS because of its higher rate of recanalization , potential expansion of the time window out to 6 hours, and lower doses of thrombolytic agent used compared with systemic or intravenous Activase. The study is designed to test the feasibility and provide preliminary safety data regarding the relative benefits and risks of IA Activase as compared to IV Activase when administered per the NINDS rt-PA stroke study protocol, i.e. randomized within 3 hours of onset of symptoms of ischemic stroke then treated within 3 hours in the IV Activase arm and within 4 hours in the IA Activase arm."
NCT00627991,"Patients who are suffering from a stroke often present to the hospital with elevated blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure in the setting of stroke increases the risk of brain swelling or bleeding into the brain. Even so, there has been concern about lowering the blood pressure with medications because the newly injured parts of the brain may not get the blood flow they need, thereby worsening the damage from the initial stroke. We hope to demonstrate that the drug valsartan can be used safely and modestly to lower blood pressure in acute stroke patients, without having a detrimental effect on brain blood flow or neurologic status. Novel MRI techniques to measure brain blood flow will be used in conjunction with clinical scales to demonstrate safety."
NCT00629005,"People with stroke experience weakness and incoordination. Studies have shown that with functional task practice, people can increase motor control and strength to a certain extent.

NCT00614224,"Aerobic treadmill exercise has been shown to improve walking, cardiovascular fitness and thereby risk factor profiles in chronic stroke patients (Macko et al., Stroke 2005). The proposed project is a randomized controlled trial in geriatric stroke patients with chronic disabilities to investigate potential mechanisms of treadmill therapy. The hypothesis is tested that 3-months of aerobic treadmill exercise induces structural brain plasticity and reorganization. The outcome measures are walking ability, gait pattern, cardiovascular fitness and brain morphology. This study will elucidate fundamental mechanisms of brain adaptations linked to task-repetitive aerobic lower extremity exercise. These mechanisms will not only lead to a better understanding but may also help to identify predictors of treatment response.

40 patients aged over 60 years with lower extremity paresis after a first-ever clinical stroke longer than 6 months prior to study inclusion will be recruited from: 1) The Geriatric Rehabilitation Clinic at the Robert-Bosch Hospital in Stuttgart 2) the Dept of Neurology, University Hospital in Tübingen. Subjects will be randomized to 3 months progressive graded aerobic treadmill exercise training (TAEX; 3 times/week, duration 10-45 min) or an attention control group (CON). Because we expect that localization and size of stroke affect therapy outcomes, stratified randomization will be used to balance entry into groups.

We hypothesize that 3 months of treadmill gait training but not conventional care leads to improvements of cardiovascular fitness and gait and to brain reorganization (structural plasticity) in regions in which functional adaptations have been demonstrated using fMRI in previous studies. The specific aims are:

To assess reorganization by comparing cortical thickness, cortical density and fiber tract morphology before (time point 0), and after therapy (3 months) using T1-weighted 3D-MPRAGE images, voxel based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging.
To correlate brain reorganization with improvements in walking velocity, and analysis of gait patterns (parameters, swing time, stance time, gait symmetry).
To correlate brain reorganization with location and size of the index stroke lesion and of diffuse white matter damage (subcortical vascular encephalopathy). Lesion and white matter damage will be evaluated based on T2-weighted FLAIR sequences."

NCT00626353,"Objective: To evaluate the effect of interdisciplinary home rehabilitation of patients with acute stroke. The trial seeks to evaluate:

Can early home rehabilitation affect the degree of independence (motor capacity, activities of daily living and cognitive status), quality of life and the possibility of discharge to own home?
Can home rehabilitation influence the length of admission at a rehabilitation centre in the municipality, readmission to hospital, the use of healthcare services and death?
To what extend can home rehabilitation be implemented according to finances? Materials and methods: Patients at the age 18 years or more admitted to the stroke unit at the University Hospital of Gentofte. The patients were eligible when meeting the following criteria: symptoms of stroke, need of rehabilitation tree days after admission, living in own home in the Municipality of Gentofte, Lyngby-Taarbaek or Rudersdal and Modified Rankin Score between 0 and 3.

The trial was conducted as a randomised controlled trial. The control group patients were rehabilitated according to normal procedure.

NCT00639730,"This research is being done to find out if the Atkins Diet can be used safely and effectively to reduce seizures in children who have Sturge Weber syndrome.

The ketogenic diet is a proven therapy for epilepsy, but can be difficult to use in children. The Atkins Diet is a high fat, high protein, low carbohydrate diet introduced in the 1970s to help with weight loss. It is different from the ketogenic diet in four major ways: no calorie restriction, no fluid restriction, no protein restriction, and is easy to start outside the hospital. People on the Atkins Diet become ketotic (produce high levels of ketones, a certain substance in the body), like patients on the ketogenic diet, and the investigators believe this may lead to seizure control.

Children aged 2-18 with Sturge Weber syndrome and seizures at least monthly, who have used at least two anti-seizure drugs may join. 5 children in total will be enrolled."

NCT00634439,"Using a proprietary insurance health claims database, Eli Lilly and Company has contracted with an external party to conduct a retrospective cohort study of health claims for the time period from 1 January 2003 through 31 December 2006 (with follow-up of patients through 30 June 2007). This study will evaluate the potential association between atomoxetine and cerebrovascular events. In this study, the incidence of selected cerebrovascular outcomes as represented in health claims data among adult patients who initiate therapy with atomoxetine will be estimated. In particular the study will focus on cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and transient ischemic attack (TIA) as the outcomes of interest. The incidence for each outcome among atomoxetine initiators will then be compared to the incidence in a cohort of similar patients who initiate stimulant treatment and an age and gender-matched general population cohort. The atomoxetine and stimulant-initiating cohorts will be matched on a broad variety of variables, including age, gender, diagnoses, medication use, and healthcare utilization through the use of propensity score matching in order to minimize the influence of confounding by indication. The analysis will include the cohorts (atomoxetine and stimulant initiators) from a previous completed study with increased follow-up time (1 January 2003 through 30 June 2007) and accrue new atomoxetine and stimulant ADHD medication initiators over a 2 year period, so that the study will represent initiators between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2006 with follow-up through June 30, 2007."

NCT04841161,"The sit-to-stand and dynamic weight-shifting ability of stroke patients is highly associated with walking performance. Therefore, in order to improve the dynamic weight-shifting ability in sit-to-stand and parallel or tandem standing, a real-time visual or auditory feedback is used in our design to allow patients to realize the weight-bearing condition (by using load cells) in both sound and affected legs immediately. It can help patients to learn to control muscle to shift weight effectively which will improve patients' walking performance. By integrating physical therapy planning with electro-mechanical technology, the goal of this study is to develop a standing balance training system by requiring patients to control their center of pressure (COP) in performing sit-to-stand and maintain a standing posture via the use of their core and lower extremity musculature."

Subjects enrolled in a double-blind placebo- controlled cross-over study that employed a comprehensive battery of language tests and measures of general cognitive and behavioral status that will be used to control for factors that may influence language functioning. The primary study outcome was a within-subject comparison of changes in language function and behavioral scores between placebo and active-treatment phases (12 weeks each).

NCT05083195,"Stroke is a clinical picture that develops due to occlusion or rupture of cerebral vessels and results in loss of cerebral functions. Stroke individuals face some limitations in managing daily activities such as walking, dressing, feeding and showering. Personal, environmental, and societal limitations have led to the development of new treatment strategies, such as telerehabilitation(TR), to meet the needs of stroke individuals and their caregivers.

In this study, patients will be randomized and divided into 2 groups in order to examine the effects of two different TR methods on physical parameters and activities of daily living in stroke patients. Baseline assessments will be made for both groups to determine functionality, activities of daily living, fall activity, quality of life, and level of fatigue. For 8 weeks, the TR group will do their exercises with exercise videos prepared on the system 3 times a week. The control group, on the other hand, will do their exercises with exercise brochures on the system 3 times a week for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, assessments will be repeated.

NCT00697645,"This study will determine the safety and efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in treating acute ischemic stroke (stroke resulting from a blood clot in the brain).

TMS was found to be effective and safe in the set up of depression. TMS acts by generating magnetic fields in the brain which simulate neuro-chemical changes and stimulate neuronal activity translating into increased secretion of growth factors such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). This is followed by positive effects of these growth and survival factors on neuronal sprouting, re-organization and also potentially on neurogenesis. Hence it is postulated that TMS will have a positive effect on the recovery rate and extent of recovery after stroke. Brainsway innovative project involves the development and use of deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in humans to treat a host of behavioral disorders, including depression and addiction. Brainsway developed a novel coil design for stimulation of deep structures in the human brain and conducted several safety and efficacy studies and recently completed a large study (70 subjects) demonstrating effectiveness in depressive patients. Deep TMS produces directed electromagnetic fields that can induce excitation or inhibition of neurons deep inside the brain. The treatment is non-invasive, with no significant side effects, and no need of hospitalization or anesthesia. Consistent with animal studies using brain stimulation deep TMS of the prefrontal cortex was found to exert potent antidepressant effects on patients not previously responsive to antidepressant drugs in two different studies. Therefore, it is expected that TMS will also be safe in patients with stroke.

Patients between 18 and 80 years of age who have had a mild or moderate acute stroke may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood tests, rating of neurological deficits such as cognition deficits or problems walking that resulted from the stroke, and a computed tomography (CT) or a magnetic resonance (MRI) scan of the head. CT involves the use of specialized X-rays and MRI involves a magnetic field to obtain images of the brain.

All participants will receive standard medical and rehabilitation therapy for stroke. In addition, patients recruited for the study will receive x sessions of TMS with the Brainsway device delivered over the motor strip of the affected hemisphere. Each session will last for y minutes. Sessions will begin on day 3 after stroke onset and will be given on an alternate day basis for 14 days (7 treatments). Patients will be monitored daily until discharge from the hospital, or until day 17, whichever is earlier. Assessments will include physical examinations and safety evaluations including blood tests to and MRI or CT scans to evaluate both the response to treatment and side effects if needed. Patients will return for a follow-up examination 30 and 90 days after treatment conclusion to evaluate their recovery rate and functional status."

NCT04695236,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) has been one of the major causes of global mortality and morbidity. The superiority of endovascular therapy (EVT) over standard medical therapy in treating AIS due to large vessel occlusion (LVO) in the anterior circulation has been widely accepted. However, a critical concern is that even with an extremely high rate of successful recanalization (the modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction [mTICI] score 2b-3) around 90%, nearly half of the patients failed to benefit from EVT. So, adjunctive therapy of EVT for neuroprotection is required.

From the previous domestic and foreign literatures, hypothermia can prevent and treat secondary injury caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury and cerebral edema of acute cerebral ischemia, so as to achieve the role of neuroprotection. In this study, intravascular cooling was performed as soon as possible with careful temperature control in patients receiving thrombectomy. The temperature was controlled at 33° C for 48-72 hours.

NCT04459091,"In addition to its physiological functions, serum albumin plays a role of neuroprotection in cerebrovascular stroke. The circulating levels of albumin may be reduced in patients with stroke due to the presence of a systemic inflammatory state and to the inadequacy of protein-energy intake. The circulating levels of albumin have proven to be predictors of functional recovery in ischemic stroke and cerebral hemorrhage.

In the present survey it is hypothesized that it is possible to significantly improve the values of hypoalbuminemia by supplementation with essential amino acids and that, in the second place, any increase in albumin may result in a strengthening of functional recovery in patients with a stroke."

NCT04188457,"Cerebral Vascular Accidents (stroke) and Myocardial Infarction (MI), which share the same risk factors, treatments and pathophysiological mechanisms, have become two major public health problems due to the increase in their prevalence rate and the longer survival after such an event in developed countries.

International data, including French data and data from our own registries, illustrate that:

risk factors that are common, mainly hypertension, smoking, high cholesterol or diabetes, remain insufficiently controlled, although they are easily detectable and treatable;
the incidence rate of stroke has doubled in 20 years in people under 55 years of age, increasing the number of people with chronic disabilities;
1-month and 1-year mortality rates for stroke and MIs have decreased by 17% in 5 years, increasing the number of survivors but with chronic disabilities;
the aging of the population and the arrival of the baby boomers of the 1950s in the at-risk age groups has increased the at-risk population;
Stroke and MI recurrence rates reached a threshold of 6% / year, in contrast to the very high rates of re-hospitalization at 1 year: 30% post-stroke and 20% post-MI, due to poorly anticipated and controlled complications. These reasons explain the lack of significant progress in preventing recurrences, preventable complications (heart failure and arrhythmias after MI; falls, sphincter and swallowing disorders, dementia and arrhythmias after stroke) and re-admission. This observation is aggravated by problems of medical demography and therefore the availability of neurologists, cardiologists and general practitioners.

Local and foreign experiments have demonstrated the value of intensive, coordinated and multi-professional stroke and MI monitoring, including nurses, in terms of: better control of risk factors and reduction of the rate of re-hospitalization by recurrence in stroke follow-up; improvement of the patient's general condition, control of risk factors, reduction in the number of events, decrease in the number of re-hospitalizations and their duration in MI follow-up. The value of pharmacists' additional intervention in intensive post-MI follow-up compared to routine follow-up has also been demonstrated, particularly in terms of significant improvement in patient compliance.

The hypothesis is that 2 years of intensive follow-up for both post-stroke or post-MI patients, by trained hospital and liberal nurses, in conjunction with doctors and pharmacists, is of medico-economic interest compared to usual follow-up. Therefore a medico-economic evaluation was designed to evaluate the efficiency of this model, which combines community-based and recourse care, prevention and coordination of care compared to usual follow-up."
NCT00729625,"Many patients who have sustained strokes are unable to effectively use their hemiparetic upper extremity. Limited mobility in the performance of daily activities, such as eating or dressing, adversely affects their quality of life and compromises independence. Rehabilitation techniques engaging the hemiparetic limb in repetitive task practice (RTP) may improve upper extremity function and quality of life in patients with stroke, but costs limit the number of patients that can utilize this type of therapy. Advances in microprocessor design and function make the use of an assistive device as an adjunct to RTP plausible. An innovative assistive repetitive motion (ARM) device using an ""air muscle"" has been developed specifically for the rehabilitation of the hemiparetic upper extremity. The primary aim of the proposed study is to collect pilot data to estimate the clinical effectiveness of using the ARM device in conjunction with RTP to improve upper extremity motor function and the quality of life of patients with stroke. Twenty sub-acute (3 to 9 mos. post-stoke) patients will be randomized to a RTP only or ARM + RTP group. The RTP group will receive 15 days (4 hours per day) of intensive one-on-one RTP therapy. The ARM + RTP group will use the ARM device for 2 hours per day and receive 2 hours of intensive RTP per day for 15 days. Clinical motor function and quality of life measures will be taken before and after the interventions and two months later. We hypothesize that the ARM + RTP group will exhibit greater improvements in motor function and quality of life measures than the RTP only group."

NCT00737334,"A highly desired result during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the ability to predict and warn the surgeon if the brain is at risk of damage during the period of time that the carotid artery is cross-clamped for surgical repair of the vessel narrowing. A number of approaches for cerebral monitoring have been developed, including EEG, cerebral oximetry, and measurement of arterial to jugular venous concentration differences of oxygen, glucose or lactate. This study will utilize and compare multiple monitoring approaches for detecting when and if the brain is at risk of injury during CEA. As such, this robust approach to monitoring may permit a more prompt intervention to prevent or limit damage should cerebral ischemia occur. In this study we will compare a processed EEG monitor -- the EEGo, which uses nonlinear analysis to a bispectral (BIS) index monitor, and to the FORE-SIGHT cerebral oximeter to assess the ability of each to identify cerebral ischemia should it occur with carotid artery cross-clamping during CEA.

NCT05435404,"During the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent series of Lockdowns, clinic out-patient spasticity services were replaced with video based tele-consultation appointments, in order to reduce the potential risk of virus transmission between patients and clinicians in either direction. This meant that for an extensive period of time, this treatment could not be offered, and like many other specialist services, this resulted in a backlog of case referrals and an extensive clinic waiting list, where patient appointments and referrals were delayed by the pandemic.

There have been discussions in many professional network forums that have suggested that the necessary changes to appointments during the pandemic may have contributed to a build-up of pain and disability for patients who were unable to access spasticity management treatment when they needed it.

This research aims to gain insight and understanding of the individual experiences and perceptions of patients, carers and a physician who have been involved in spasticity treatment out-patient service clinics during and post COVID 19 pandemic. To do this, a qualitative research approach has been adopted and a group of 10 potential participants along with one consultant physician will be invited to participate in the study.

NCT03297827,"Various molecules (cytokines: interleukins, interferons and neural proteins) found in human and animal blood are reported to be elevated in acute stroke (Ischemic and hemorrhagic). Cytokines can be pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory. There are studies confirming level changes in serum of humans in the setting of several rheumatologic and cardiovascular diseases. As new molecular markers (cytokines and neural tissue markers) are established in scientific literature, stroke scientists are interested to evaluate the role of these in the pathophysiology of stroke. Investigators intend to study the role of these molecules in the development of stroke.

Acute stroke treatment has advanced considerably in the last 10 years with the establishment of comprehensive stroke centers and approval of neuro-interventional techniques. However, the molecular advancement in stroke pathogenesis has yet to reach a milestone in the world of stroke treatment. In our opinion, creating a database of acute stroke patients containing all pertinent medical demographics and clinical information along with the laboratory data, molecular levels of pertinent cytokines/neural factors from consenting patients, will help us define and delineate the most relevant molecules that are altered in acute stroke patients and can help us further improve us understanding of the role of these in acute stroke and thereby hopefully help in the improvement of our understanding and management of stroke. Moreover, analyzing the cytokines in stroke and ICH patients would help understand their role in the acute phase, which may become potential therapeutic adjuncts for tPA and endovascular thrombectomy."

NCT04030806,"Stroke is characterized by poor brain perfusion resulting from an ischemic or hemorrhagic event, causing a sensorimotor disorder in the upper extremity (UE) contralateral to the lesion. Mirror Therapy (MT) has been used in rehabilitation and its effects are related to the activation of mirror neurons and cortical reorganization. However, few studies have investigated the isolated effect of MT on the rehabilitation of these individuals.

Objective: To investigate the isolated effect of MT on motor function, sensitivity, muscle strength, manual dexterity and spasticity of the paretic UE of individuals with chronic hemiparesis after stroke.

Design: Randomized simple-blind trial. Subject: Twenty-six patients post chronic, aged between 30 and 80 years, with mild or moderate sensorimotor impairment in UE will be evaluated.

Intervention: The subjects will be randomly distributed in: intervention group will perform 60 minutes of MT and the control group will perform 60 minutes of control therapy composed of the same exercises, but without the mirror. Both groups will hold two sessions per week for six weeks.

Main measure: Participants will be evaluated before and after the intervention. They will be evaluated through the Fugl-Meyer Scale to measure UL sensorimotor performance, Box-and-Block Test for manual dexterity, Dynamometry for palmar grip strength and Modified Ashworth Scale for spasticity. With this study, it was expected that the intervention group presented better results regarding the sensorimotor function when compared to the control group.

The data will be expressed as mean and 95% confidence interval (continuous variable) and absolute frequency (categorical variables).

NCT00789542,"Strokes occur when blood flow to part of the brain is interrupted. Patients are often bedbound for several days or weeks although if they survive, most will make some recovery. The lack of mobility encourages blood clots to form in the legs - so called deep venous thrombosis or DVT. About 10% of patients will develop these. Pieces of this clot may break off and can be carried by the bloodstream to the lungs. These clots, called pulmonary emboli, can stop the heart and can cause patients with stroke to die suddenly. A treatment which reduces the risk of DVT after surgery is intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC). Inflatable sleeves wrapped around the legs inflate at intervals squeezing blood up the legs, increasing the blood flow, and decreasing the likelihood of clots forming - at least that is the theory!. Although this sounds uncomfortable, most people actually quite like the sensation! There have been some small randomised trials of IPC in stroke patients, particularly those with intracerebral bleeding. However, these studies although encouraging have not provided enough information to persuade clinicians to use this treatment routinely in stroke units. The proposed study will include 2000 patients who have had a stroke and who have been admitted to a stroke unit.

Patients who cannot walk independently, and who are at greatest risk of DVT will be invited to join the study. If they agree they will be randomly allocated to having routine care plus IPC or just routine care. Patient in both groups will have routine ultrasound scans on their legs to detect DVTs. The study will establish whether IPC reduces the risk of DVT. This result could improve the outcome of many thousands of patients each year."

Previous research has indicated that cognitive-affective-behavioural profile is related to exercise activity in a number of populations including sedentary adults, older adults and patients with cardiovascular disease. As we anticipate that one of the mechanisms by which the cycling will result in an outcome better than the more traditional type of disability tailored exercise program is through greater compliance, this second objective is very relevant. This study will also address the impact of regular exercise on cardio-vascular risk factor profile."

NCT00792220,"Stroke, the most common cause of permanent disability, the second most common cause of dementia and third most common cause of death, has tremendous socio-economic consequences.

Currently, systemic thrombolysis with the tissue plasminogen activator represents the only causal and approved treatment for acute ischemic stroke. However, the chances to save the brain tissue by a thrombolytic therapy exponentially decrease with proceeding time after onset of symptoms.

In most cases, the beginning of the thrombolysis therapy is delayed by a variety of factors, like delivery to the hospital, re-examinations and delay of blood analysis or of CT scans. Due to this, a thrombolytic therapy is possible only in a minority of the stroke patients (2-5 %). The aim of this study is to investigate whether a ""Mobile Stroke Unit"", a rescue car with an integrated CT scanner, necessary for essential diagnostics, contributes to a better stroke management by saving precious time until a therapeutic decision is made. The trial is planned as a monocentric, randomised prospective trial."

NCT01136993,"Objective is to describe two years experience from The Finnish Telestroke piloting between Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH), Department of Neurology, The Hub, and five hospitals, the spokes. The participating hospitals are from Rovaniemi (Lapland), Kemi (North-West of Finland), Lappeenranta, Kuusankoski and Kotka from South-East of Finland. All the participating hospitals have a stroke unit and the thrombolysis treatment and the follow up of the patients are carried in the treating hospital. The aim of the pilot is to provide these hospitals expertise in thrombolysis treatment during off-hours through teleconsultations.

The teleconsultations were begun between the participating hospitals 05/2007 after about 1 years preparation period. During the preparation period the staff from participating hospitals were trained with simulation training and lectures held by the local staff and the faculty of the Helsinki University hospital.

Telestroke consultation: During two way interactive audio-visual consultation the thrombolysis decision is based on: 1) the consultant going through a check up list of indications and no contraindications to the treatment together with the treating physician and 2) Clinical assessment of NIHSS by the treating physician under guidance of the consultant through the two way video system besides 3) Evaluation of the head CT scan.

The data registered is based on documents made at HUCH and the follow up data provided by the chief neurologist of the other hospitals. 109 teleconsultations have been documented over 2 years period. A unique feature of the Finnish pilot is the high percentage of consultations leading to thrombolysis treatment.

NCT00850408,"Weakness of the arm and hand results in long-term disability for many persons who suffer a stroke. After the initial recovery phase, only limited gains are achieved by retraining the weak limb to perform daily tasks. However, new treatment strategies such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) show promise for enhancing motor recovery after stroke. rTMS is a noninvasive technique for modifying brain activity that aims to improve motor function by correcting abnormal patterns that occur after stroke. We believe that giving rTMS right before a therapy session will prepare the brain so that the patient is better able to participate in and benefit from training of the hand and arm. The goal of this study is to test how well this new strategy works to improve recovery in people who have mild to moderate weakness of the arm and hand after stroke.

Participants will receive magnetic stimulation of the movement area of the brain just prior to arm and hand training for a series of eight sessions. We will evaluate changes in hand and arm function after the intervention and one month later to see if the changes are maintained. We will also test whether some groups of people benefit more than others from the intervention. If improvements in hand and arm function are observed after the intervention, we will test it more rigourously in a future clinical trial in which participants are randomly assigned to different treatment conditions. This research will show whether brain stimulation can be used to improve the effectiveness of rehabilitation care."

NCT00859885,"The prevalence of patent foramen ovale (PFO) is about 25% in the general population and approximately 40% in patients who have ischemic stroke of unknown cause (cryptogenic stroke). Given the large number of asymptomatic patients, no primary prevention is currently recommended. On the contrary, secondary prevention is very important. Prospective studies have shown that antithrombotic treatment (ATT) with aspirin or warfarin appears to negate the risk of recurrent stroke associated with a PFO. Patients with spontaneous or large right-to-left shunts (RLS), those with a coinciding atrial septal aneurysm (ASA) or multiple ischemic events prior to the PFO diagnosis may still be at increased risk of stroke recurrence despite ATT. Percutaneous device closure (PDC) is a challenging alternative to ATT. Several studies reported 0% to 3.4% annual recurrence rates of stroke or TIA in patients treated by PDC. To date, there is no data from randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing the risk of stroke recurrence after PDC with that under ATT only. The results from ongoing RCTs are not to be awaited in the near future, mainly due to low enrolment and event rates. Alternative data-gathering strategies such as multicenter registries are needed to overcome the low recruitment rates. The aim of the present study is to compare the risk of recurrent stroke and TIA in patients with PFO and otherwise unexplained stroke who undergo PDC or receive ATT."

NCT05071885,"Recovery programs of the upper extremity can be extensive, for many adults with neurological disorders/injuries, including maintenance exercises that need to be done continually to maintain function and to prevent secondary disabilities. However increasing demands and shrinking funds are making it harder to meet the rehabilitation needs of Manitobans and Canadians with chronic disabilities. There is a need for innovation to improve the accessibility and engagement of rehabilitation programs for adults with upper extremity (UE) motor impairments due to spinal cord and acquired brain injuries.

The purpose of this research proposal is the further development and validation of a multipurpose plug-n-play rehab gaming system for use in community centers, in particular, at First Step Wellness center. It's no sleight of hand our gaming system provides a basis for repetitive, task-specific therapy focused on manual dexterity; object handling and manipulation for adults with spinal cord and acquired brain injuries. It was designed to transition engaging, highly effective and personalized rehabilitation programs to function in community centers , and with automated monitoring (tele monitoring), which to manage and progress outreach programs.

The gaming system consist of hardware and software components the hardware includes a low-cost, portable smart exercise manipulanduu device (EMD), with assistive technology. The EMD is designed as a HID compliant plug-n-play computer input device that emulates a standard optical computer mouse. Therefore these devices can be used with most any common/ modern computer video game that function by mouse control. Inclusion of ""fun"" gaming elements is intended to provide extra motivation for the patients in the form of a challenge and a more enjoyable means of encouraging them to follow tedious, repetitive movements that are often a part of the rehabilitation process. Therapeutic value can be derived from both the types of object manipulation tasks (use of the EMD), as well as the choice of computer games. Many inexpensive and readily available common computer games exist that require different levels of movement amplitude, speeds, accuracy repetition, cognitive enhancements, and offer sufficient diversity to appeal to a broad range of individual preferences (both children and adults).

A purpose-built Rehabilitation game (RTP game) has also been developed and validated. It was designed to gather event data and synchronize it with patient movements while they practice a range of game-based exercises with the hand and arm. This will provide; a) automated monitoring, assessment embedded into treatment, b) Immediate feedback to client, and c) electronic outcome measures to quantify and track client's performance over time Clinical support of outreach programs with protocols that can be easily updated will help create better-targeted and personalized solutions for patients and achieve the desired rehabilitation outcomes.

The innovation of this approach comes from the implementation of well-designed, yet inexpensive and easy-to-use hardware and computer software (i.e. in essence a computer mouse and a computer game). It can be judged in terms of the fact that the proposed system would provide highly effective exercise programs with embedded assessment and timely feedback/support for use in community centers and ultimately the home (tele rehabilitation). This research will contribute to the development and validation of promising, new technologies that have he capacity to become widely adopted as a viable, affordable eHealth tool that will support the quality of life and participation of Canadians living with chronic disabilities."

NCT00880113,"Less than 10% of all ischemic stroke patients are treated by intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) as most present later than the accepted 3 hour time window. Intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) is possible 3-6 hours post ictus, but is infrequently used. Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) with a MERCI device is a new intervention possibility but lacks large randomized studies. Although it is desirable to treat more stroke patients, clinical information and plain CT alone are insufficient to discriminate which patients are most likely to benefit or be harmed from treatment. Advanced imaging techniques can help predict patient outcome and provide the necessary information to weigh expected benefit against associated risk of treatment. Visualizing the penumbra, the hypoperfused tissue at risk of infarction around the irreversible infarct core, is one way of identifying patients most likely to benefit from intervention. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based selection of patients with sufficient penumbra for thrombolysis is possible, however, MR has less 24-hour availability than CT in the acute setting. Plain CT is mostly used to exclude intracerebral hemorrhage, and can easily be extended with CT perfusion (CTP) and CT angiography (CTA). CTP compares well to MRI for imaging penumbra and infarct core, and it is faster and more feasible than MRI. Other image findings such as infarct core size and leakage of the blood-brain-barrier (permeability) on CTP, and site and extent of the occlusion and collateral circulation on CTA also influence stroke outcome but have not been combined in one study to assess their combined predictive value.

Hypothesis:

The investigators hypothesize that combined CTP and CTA parameters can predict patient outcome in acute ischemic stroke."

NCT05041582,"Post-stroke motor recovery is compelling but limited. Current rehabilitation has less impacts on the plateau that spontaneous biological recovery could be expected. The advances in non-invasive neuromodulation and neurophysiological characterization of critical motor recovery period enable breaking the proportional recovery limitation. Our pilot studies demonstrated the safety and responsiveness of combing dual transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and motor training in subacute stroke patients. There is also strong evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can substantially increase the effects of tDCS and improve motor function after stroke, even in the absence of depression. This proposal aims to prove the potential of combining of tDCS and the commonly used SSRI citalopram to improve response to a daily motor training intervention in acute stroke patients (Co-STARS trial)."

NCT04165616,"This study will contribute to the field of stroke rehabilitation research by expanding the investigator's understanding of the neural mechanisms responsible for the development and expression of abnormal flexion synergy, a primary movement impairment due to stroke. The study will longitudinally evaluate motor tract morphology and motor impairment/function in an attempt to develop early neuroimaging-based predictors of the development of flexion synergy and its impact on reaching and hand recovery (6 month). The study will utilize quantitative motor testing (kinematics and kinetics) to measure motor impairment and reaching and hand function. Both neuroimaging and quantitative motor testing will be conducted within 96 hours-, 2 weeks-, 3 months-, and 6 months-post stroke. The knowledge gained by this study will provide crucial structural and functional neuroimaging evidence that demonstrates the timeline of progressive ipsi- and contralesional motor pathway (including bulbospinal pathways) changes and the associated development of flexion synergy that grossly impacts reaching and hand function in individuals with moderate to severe stroke."

MIT uses a simple form of singing, while SRT uses intensive repetition of a set of words and phrases. We want to see which intensive form of treatment is more effective in leading to an improvement in speech output compared to a no-therapy control period, and whether either treatment can cause changes in brain activity during speaking and changes in brain structure. We will use a technique known as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to measure blood flow changes in the brain and structural MRI that assess brain anatomy and connections between brain regions. We will use fMRI to assess brain activity while a patient speaks, sings, and hums. We will assess changes in brain activity and in brain structure by comparing scans done prior to treatment to scans obtained after treatment and we will also examine changes between treatment groups.

NCT03570216,"There is an urgent need to reduce the impact of stroke by promoting optimal rehabilitation strategies that decrease the risk of stroke. Improving cardiovascular health following a stroke is a key rehabilitation strategy that has the potential to reduce the risk of a recurrent event.

Adverse cardiovascular events, including stroke, are often due to chronic atherosclerosis, which shows as increased arterial stiffness. Elevated arterial stiffness is prevalent in individuals with cardiovascular disease, is associated with markers of silent cerebrovascular disease and is a new marker for predicting cardiovascular risk. Cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) are used to assess cardiorespiratory fitness. Novel CPET protocols have emerged for stroke, enabling safe and valid measurements of cardiorespiratory fitness. Cardiovascular exercise, typically performed through moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICE), can improve function and fitness in individuals living with stroke and lower the risk of recurrent stroke. Recently, high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) has emerged as a potentially potent stimulus that may also lead to improvements in function and fitness. While HIIE has shown benefits in clinical and non-clinical populations, only a few small, preliminary studies have examined the effects of HIIE in individuals living with stroke, and most have primarily focused on examining the effects of HIIE on function and gait. No study has examined and compared the acute effects of a CPET, MICE and HIIE on arterial stiffness in stroke. This study will (1) examine the acute effects of a single session of this HIIE protocol compared to a CPET and a single session of MICE on arterial stiffness among individuals with chronic stroke, and (2) the feasibility of a high-intensity interval training exercise protocol previously found to be tolerable and effective in attaining high levels of exercise intensity in in these individuals."

NCT03521882,"Stroke is caused by sudden changes in blood flow in the brain. This can be fatal or can result in permanent disability. A fast diagnosis is essential to initiate effective interventions and optimize benefits to patients. There are other diseases that can look like a stroke and these are called ""stroke mimics"". The quicker that stroke mimics can be ruled out the faster a stroke can be diagnosed and treatment can be given. The investigators may be able to use chemicals in the blood to rapidly confirm that a person has had a stroke. One such chemical is called eotaxin. Eotaxin has been found to be changed in sufferers of a stroke but not in those with stroke mimics. However, more research is needed to confirm the usefulness of eotaxin. This feasibility study aims to provide the foundations to allow a large scale trial of this test. The study aims to recruit participants that have had a stroke or a stroke mimic from the Acute Stroke Unit and Stroke clinic at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital. Up to 6 blood samples will be taken from each participant at different times over one week. Eotaxin will be measured in these samples and in participant's leftover samples taken for clinical care. This is needed because the investigators know that the amount of eotaxin changes in the blood after a stroke but we do not know how quickly this change happens and for how long the change occurs. The study will also allow the investigators to understand how many participants will be needed for a large scale trial and the challenges that may be faced in recruiting participants."

NCT03511300,"Apathy is a syndrome of reduced motivation, characterized by diminished goal-directed behaviours (e.g., lack of effort), decreased goal-oriented cognitions (e.g., lack of interest) and blunted affect. Apathy is present in 20-50% of individuals after experiencing a stroke. Despite the detrimental impact of reduced goal-directed behaviours and cognitions on activities of daily living and cognition in stroke patients, interventions for increasing motivation (reducing apathy) have yet to be examined in this population. This study will examine the effect of goal-setting instructions on cognitive performance in stroke patients. The investigators hypothesize that in stroke patients, goal-setting instructions will improve cognitive performance relative to standard instructions. If goal-setting instructions are effective in improving cognitive performance, it may indicate that treatments targeting apathy could serve as a novel way to improve cognitive outcomes and enhance patient quality of life post-stroke."
NCT00913211,"Paralysis following stroke stems not only from the loss of neurons killed by the stroke but also from the loss of neurons lying dormant in the stroke hemisphere. One of the reasons viable neurons become dormant (down-regulated) is because of excessive interhemispheric inhibition imposed on them from the nonstroke hemisphere. The challenge in neurorehabilitation is to restore excitability and voluntary control of these down-regulated neurons in the stroke hemisphere. Suppression of the source of this excessive interhemispheric inhibition can be achieved with the noninvasive method called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). It has been shown in healthy subjects that the known depressant effects of low-frequency rTMS can be increased and prolonged by preceding it with 6-Hz priming stimulation. In a recent safety study, we showed that one treatment of 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS applied to the nonstroke hemisphere is safe. It is now important to evaluate a series of these treatments and whether their efficacy can be enhanced by combining the rTMS with motor learning training. The specific aims of this study are to determine the efficacy, mechanism, and safety of a series of 5 treatments of 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS applied to nonstroke hemisphere and combined with motor learning training to promote recovery of the paretic hand. Forty subjects with stroke will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. The rTMS/only group will receive 20 min. of rTMS per day. The Track/only group will receive 20 min. of finger tracking training per day. The rTMS/combined group will receive alternating days of the rTMS and Track treatments. The rTMS/sham group will receive 20 min. of rTMS using a sham electrode each day. The hypotheses are: 1) the rTMS/combined group will show the greatest improvements in hand function, 2) the rTMS/combined group will show the greatest improvements in cortical excitability using paired-pulse TMS testing and in brain reorganization using fMRI, and 3) the rTMS treatment will be safe. The proposed research is important because it addresses the greatest cause of long-term disability in society, hemiparesis following stroke, and it is innovative because it applies a technique never used before, 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS combined with motor learning training. The potential impact of this research is a radical change to rehabilitation that accomplishes a higher quality of life in stroke."

NCT03247998,"After a stroke caused by a blockage (clot) in a blood vessel in the brain, patients may have the clot removed by threading a catheter from the groin up to the affected area of the brain. An anesthesiologist is involved in the patient's care during this procedure to maximize patient safety and procedural efficiency. The options for anesthesia for this procedure are general anesthesia (where the patient is unconscious) or sedation (where the patient is in a relaxed, calm, sleepy condition).

NCT01311544,"The Magnetic Resonance angiography (MRA) of supraaortic vessels is essential for the etiologic of stroke. However, the techniques usually used provide only static evaluation (degree of stenosis, occlusion) but not dynamic. An ultra-fast 3D MRA originally developed for the cardiac imaging, k-t blast (Broad-use Linear Acquisition Speed-up Technique) could be used to review the supraaortic vessels. This MRA offers the following advantages: short acquisition time, wide spatial coverage (of the thoracic aorta to the distal encephalic arteries), 3D spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. These qualities are even more optimal with a high magnetic field (3T). The high temporal resolution is interesting because it provides to repeat a volume every eight seconds and thus to have a dynamic evaluation of vascular filling and to assess the vascular supply of the infarcted territory. This sequence is classified as a 4D MRA."

NCT02554487,"Investigating the interrelation of stroke and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is of major importance. First because of the high occurrence rate of stroke and the fact that it is a frequent cause of long-term disability in adulthood. Second because SDB (obstructive, central and mixed forms) affects more than 50% of stroke survivors and has a detrimental effect on clinical stroke outcome. Third, spontaneous and learning-dependent sleep-associated neuroplasticity may be affected by SDB following stroke worsening stroke rehabilitation. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate whether early treatment of SDB with Adaptive Servo-Ventilation (ASV), the treatment device of choice to treat obstructive, central and mixed forms of SDB, has a beneficial effect on the evolution of the lesion volume and on clinical stroke outcome.

To this end, the investigators recruit and prospectively follow 3 groups of patients with ischemic stroke over 1 year. During the first night after hospital admission due to acute stroke, nocturnal breathing is assessed by means of a respiratory polygraphy. Patients with significant sleep disordered breathing, defined as an Apnea-Hypopnea-Index (AHI) > 20/h, are randomized to ASV treatment or no treatment (sSDB ASV+ or sSDB ASV-). ASV treatment starts the second night following hospital admission and ends 90 days later. Stroke patients without SDB (AHI < 5 / h) serve as a control group (no SDB) to observe the evolution of the lesion volume and stroke outcome without the additional burden of SDB.

Lesion volume one day after hospital admission due to acute stroke (after potential lysis therapy) measured by Diffusion Weighted Imaging will be subtracted from lesion volume measured by T2-weighted volumetry assessed 90(+/-7) days following stroke and compared between patients with and without ASV treatment (sSDB ASV+ and sSDB ASV-) as well as patients without SDB (no SDB). Short- and long-term clinical stroke outcomes are assessed by clinical scales and questionnaires 4 to 7 days, 3 months and 1 year following stroke. Cognitive outcome is assessed during hospitalization (within the first week following stroke) and after the treatment period of 90 days by neuropsychological tests assessing attention and memory. In addition, baseline assessment of physiological parameters such as blood pressure and endothelial function/arterial stiffness are assessed during the first weeks following stroke and at the end of the treatment period, i.e. approximately 90 days following stroke."

NCT01818349,"Background: A discrepancy between strength gain and gait changes following various training programs aimed at improving gait function after stroke has been noted. A mismatch between the training program and gait parameters could explain this finding.

Objective: To evaluate the impact of an isokinetic-strengthening program, matching the requirements of the affected lower-limb muscle groups involved in the energy generation of gait, to a control intervention, on gait performance and muscle strength.

Hypothesis: The isokinetic training program of the affected lower-limb muscles would produce greater changes in gait performance and strength than a control intervention not aiming at training these muscle groups.

Design: Single-blinded randomized controlled trial.

Participants: A convenient sample of 30 individuals with chronic hemiparesis.

Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned into two groups (n=15), each training three times/week for six weeks. The experimental group trained the affected plantarflexors, hip flexors and extensors concentrically, while the control group trained the affected upper-limb muscles.

Main outcome measures: Baseline values and post-training values, taken at the end of the training program, of maximal voluntary concentric strength, gait speed and peak positive power."

NCT03377465,"A stroke is the second cause of deaths after heart attack, one of the most important causes of malfunction as far as adults are concerned and the second as for the frequency cause of dementia. In spite of a possibility of the therapy of stroke ( tissue plasminogen activator) and recognized most of risk factors there is expected that incidence rate on stroke connected with ageing of the society will be growing. It will cause medical and social consequences.

There are many of potential causes of cardiac strokes, which are not entirely examined.

More over many cryptogenic strokes are presumed to have an embolic etiology, and the frequent cause of these kind of strokes at young age is probably the mechanism of paradoxical embolism through patent foramen ovale.

As far as the investigators are concerned, at present there is lack of any recommendations for these scientific hypothesis."

The primary objective of our study is to assess the incidence of newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation during 28 days of chest and thumb-ECG monitoring in patients with cryptogenic stroke. Secondary objectives are to assess Health-related Quality of Life using Short Form-36 and the feasibility of the Coala Heart Monitor in patients with stroke."
NCT04042961,"People with stroke should exercise to maintain function and reduce the risk of another stroke. Different types of exercise target different components of fitness, such as aerobic, strength, and balance. Post-stroke exercise guidelines exist for each type of exercise separately (eg, brisk walking as aerobic exercise, resistance training for strength, and Tai Chi for balance). Meeting these recommendations means spending a lot of time exercising, and people with stroke say that lack of time and fatigue are barriers to exercise. It is possible to target several components of fitness with one type of exercise.

'Reactive balance training' (RBT) is a type of exercise that improves control of reactions that are needed to prevent a fall after losing balance, and is the only type of exercise with potential to prevent falls in daily life post-stroke. Because RBT involves repeated whole-body movements it may have similar aerobic benefit as other exercises using whole-body movements (eg, brisk walking). Also, leg muscles need to generate a lot of force to make rapid steps in RBT; repeatedly generating this force may help to improve strength.

The purpose of this study is to determine if RBT improves two important components of fitness among people with chronic stroke: aerobic capacity and strength. The investigators expect that the improvements in aerobic capacity and strength after RBT will not be any worse than after an exercise program that specifically targets aerobic fitness and strength. A secondary purpose of this study is to determine the effects of RBT compared to aerobic and strength training on balance control and balance confidence. The investigators expect that RBT will lead to greater improvements in balance control and balance confidence than an aerobic and strength training program."
NCT03443245,"Currently, there is no reliable biomarker for stroke, meaning that treatment is often delayed and patients are often left with a disability. Stroke is one of the largest causes of mortality (death) and morbidity (disease) in the UK and affects around 120 and 15 people per 100,000 population. This has huge economic implications, with around £9 billion a year being spent on stroke in the UK alone, and health and social care costs accounting for half of this amount. Productivity losses (i.e. income costs) are estimated at £1.33 billion and benefit payments total £840 million per year.

Previous studies involving heart attack patients have suggested that succinate (a biomarker) levels rise after reperfusion (reoxygenation) of the heart tissue and in the context of ischaemia (i.e. when a restriction of blood supply to the heart has caused a heart attack and the tissue has been reoxygenated to improve blood flow around the body). Malonate is a therapeutic option to block this rise in succinate and reduce any potential resulting damage. Animal studies support these findings and have further shown that malonate prevents ischaemic brain damage and reduces the succinate increase in tissue.

However, there is currently no pre-clinical data for the release of succinate into blood, nor for stroke. This study aims to explore whether elevated succinate levels are present in stroke patients having thrombolysis (brain reperfusion). If we can show that elevated succinate levels are attributed to stroke (and not a result of thrombolysis), it might be possible to identify a therapeutic intervention at baseline for these patients and this reduce disability in all stroke patients, and healthcare costs in turn."
NCT04342143,"Stroke is a major global health problem and main cause of disability worldwide. Blood pressure control is important for good health in stroke patients. Measuring central blood pressure (the blood pressure which is found in the heart) and measuring the stiffness of your arteries will give practitioners, clinicians and researcher's important information over and above what is usually obtained from peripheral blood pressure in the arm. The most validated and most recognisable equipment for central blood pressure and arterial stiffness is the SphygmoCor XCEL. However, the Doppler Ultrasound is used more often in population-based studies and has been shown to be a precise and accurate measurement. Although these devices are validated, they both require a highly skilled operator and are quite time-consuming. As such, it is important to explore less operator dependent and time consuming devices, such as the Vicorder, as this could be essential for researchers and clinicians.Therefore, this study will investigate whether the Vicorder device is valid and reliable when measuring these outcomes and if so could be implemented in large research studies and potenially be used by clinicians."

NCT00006414,"This study will examine the effectiveness of an experimental treatment to improve hand function in patients who have had a stroke affecting one side of the body. One of the main problems of stroke patients is difficulty using the affected hand. Most treatments focus on acute (early) intervention, although special exercises may help some chronic patients. Previous studies have indicated that combining hand exercises with anesthesia (blocking motor and sensory function) of the upper arm may improve hand movement in stroke patients, even in the chronic state. This study will examine whether the exercise plus anesthesia treatment is more beneficial for these patients over the long-term than exercise alone.

Patients 18 years or older who are at least 12 months post stroke, which has affected only one side of the body, may be eligible for this study. Candidates will have a medical history and physical and neurological examinations.

Participants will be randomly divided into two groups: one will practice hand exercises without upper arm anesthesia and the other will exercise with anesthesia. All patients will perform two consecutive sessions of 30-minute pinch practice-forceful pinching of the thumb and index finger. Patients in the anesthesia group will have the anesthetic injected in the lower neck. Enough anesthetic will be administered to block motor and sensory function in the shoulder and upper arm, while maintaining as much function as possible in the forearm and hand.

All patients will also have transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) testing. For this procedure, a very brief electrical current is passed through an insulated wire coil placed on the head, producing a magnetic pulse. The pulse travels through the scalp and skull and causes small electrical currents in the outer part of the brain. During the study, the patient will be asked to make movements, do simple tasks, or tense muscles, while the electrical activity of the muscles is recorded.

Patients will have four sessions at 3-week intervals and three follow-up sessions at 3 weeks, 9 weeks and 24 weeks after the testing. Follow-up evaluations will include pinch power testing, TMS, sensory function test and hand function measurement."

NCT00930020,"Background: Stroke is a leading cause of death and chronic serious disability worldwide.

Minocycline, a semisynthetic tetracycline, has consistently been shown in recent years to be neuroprotective in animal models of brain ischemia. Furthermore, a small, open label study done in humans with acute ischemic stroke published late last year showed that minocycline, when administered for 5 days, within 6 to 24 hours after stroke onset was highly effective in improving functional outcome even as early as 7 days after stroke onset. However, further well-conducted, randomized controlled translational studies using minocycline are currently lacking.

Objective: To determine if minocycline, administered within 3 to 48 hours after acute ischemic stroke onset is superior to placebo in reducing neurological deficit and improving functional outcome at 90 days post stroke.

Methods: The investigators plan to do a multi-centre randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial in which ischemic stroke patients will be randomized to treatment with either oral minocycline or placebo within 3 to 48 hours of symptom onset. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score for all randomized subjects at 90 days.

Secondary endpoints will include improvement of the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score from baseline and Barthel index at 90 days.

NeuMAST will test the following hypotheses:

Primary Hypothesis: Minocycline, compared with placebo, when administered between 3 to 48 hours after the onset of acute ischemic stroke improves recovery and functional outcome as assessed by mRS scores on day 90 post-stroke.

Secondary Hypotheses:

Minocycline compared to placebo, when administered between 3 to 48 hours after onset of acute ischemic stroke improves recovery and functional outcome as assessed by improvement of NIHSS score on day 90 post-stroke.
Minocycline compared to placebo, when administered between 3 to 48 hours after onset of acute ischemic stroke improves functional outcome as assessed by the Barthel Index (BI) score on day 90 post-stroke.
Minocycline, compared with placebo reduces 90 day risk of recurrent stroke, MI or death when administered between 3 to 48 hours after acute ischemic stroke onset.

A positive result will have a significant impact in the management of acute ischemic stroke and pave the way for future studies aimed at finding the optimal dose and formulation of minocycline for treating acute ischemic stroke."

NCT00966316,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether the clinical pathway for acute ischemic stroke(with combination of traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine) is able to improve the outcome of acute ischemic stroke and evaluate its effect on hospital day and cost, etc. Meanwhile, the study will discuss the safety and efficiency of this kind of Clinical Pathway"
NCT00967408,"Rehabilitative treatment in stroke survivors has shown to be effective in improving functional outcome and reducing dependency. Plasticity of the central nervous system, along with coping strategies and adaptations, seems to play a key role in functional recovery. Some data support the hypothesis that drug which improve dopaminergic, serotoninergic and noradrenergic transmission in the central nervous system could improve recovery in stroke patients. In this population, antidepressants as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are associated to better outcomes, as evidenced by small clinical trials. However, since depression is a common consequence of stroke, observed improvements could be biased by the action of these drugs on depressive symptoms, thus improving participation in rehabilitative treatment.

The hypothesis of this study is that SSRI could improve functional outcome in stroke survivors not only because of their action on depressive symptoms, but mainly because of a direct effect on neural repair and neuronal growth.

The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of a SSRI, escitalopram, on functional outcome of stroke patients."
NCT00975962,"This study is a blinded randomized study. Randomization for treatment/not treatment with remote perconditioning takes place during transportation to the hospital. This is because the investigators' hypothesis states that remote perconditioning is neuro-protective and the effect is proportionally larger with early treatment. As the size of the effect is unknown, the investigators will use multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to determine the size of a potential neuro-protective effect.

The aims of this study are:

To describe method of remote perconditioning in clinical practice regarding feasibility. Pros and cons and potential limitations.
To estimate the size of the effect of remote perconditioning in combination with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPa) treatment within four and a half hours of onset of symptoms."
NCT00976001,"This is a randomized follow-up study after discharge from a stroke unit after a first stroke. The patients are randomized either to follow-up at a special out-patient stroke unit or with their general practitioners. The hypothesis is that follow-up with specialists is superior to follow-up with general practitioners. Endpoints are mortality, recurrent stroke and handicap measured with different scales."
NCT00983450,"The study will include 20 subjects who will be randomly divided to two groups: a ten person group being the study group and a ten person group acting as a control group (each group will include a similar number of females and males as the other group). In addition, the physiotherapy treatments at the rehabilitation center, the study group will gain an intervention consisting of 12 therapy sessions, administered for 12 consecutive days (apart of weekends). The intervention will include 6 minutes of watching a movie clip alternately showing a healthy man and a healthy woman at their sixties, walking while being filmed from various angles. Immediately after watching, the subject will perform 6 minutes of walking, under the experimenters supervision, but without his or hers intervention. Immediately following the walking, the whole procedure will be repeated (watching a clip and walking).

The control group will undergo 12 treatments of the same nature, but will watch the movie clip shown backwards, so that the people filmed will seem to walk backwards (it was established that watching a reversed action does not activate the MNS system activated by a regular execution of the activity [Celnik et al., 2008]), followed by 6 minutes of walking under the experimenters supervision, then watching the movie again and walking again.

The person performing the examinations will be blinded as to the division of the subjects to the study group and the control group. After performing the previously noted examinations needed to participate in the research, the subjects found fit will be examined before the beginning of the intervention, at its end and then three months after its conclusion. The examinations will include smart step and walking parameters."

NCT04816929,"Trunk impairment and asymmetry that occur after stroke negatively affect many functional activities in the daily lives of patients. There are different neurophysiological approaches such as Bobath method and task-oriented approach used in post-stroke rehabilitation programs in the literature. However, there are not many studies that comprehensively evaluate and compare the effects of these neurophysiological approaches on trunk muscles, balance and gait in stroke patients. The aim of this study is to examine and compare the effects of Bobath method and task-oriented approach on architectural features and activation of trunk muscles and functional performance in stroke patients. In addition, this study will demonstrate with muscle thickness and activation the asymmetry that may occur between the hemiparetic and non-paretic trunk muscles of stroke patients, and will allow examining the effects of these features on functional performance. This study was planned to include two treatment groups. The Bobath group will receive Bobath based trunk, balance and walking exercises, while the task-oriented group will receive exercises for oriented task. Trunk impairment, motor functions, thickness and activation of trunk muscles, spatio-temporal parameters of gait, balance and goal attainment will be assessed before and after 8 weeks treatment program. As a result; effectiveness of Bobath method and task-oriented approach will be compared and relationship between muscle thickness, activation and functional performance will be examined."

NCT00023569,"This study will determine whether an electric shock to the forearm can improve hand function in patients with chronic stroke and, if so, whether the improvement is related to brain reorganization. Some studies indicate that electromyography-triggered neuromuscular electrical stimulation (EMG-triggered NMES) on the forearm improves wrist motor function in patients with chronic stroke. The shock is delivered to the wrist extensor muscle of the forearm, causing greater hand movement than the patient can make on his or her own. The study will determine if the electric shock is more effective given after the patient initiates the hand movement (EMG-triggered NMES) than at times unrelated to patient effort (NMES alone).

Stroke patients with muscle weakness on one side of the body may be eligible for this study. The stroke must have occurred at least 12 months before the patient enters the study. Candidates will have a medical history and physical and neurological examinations.

Participants will be divided randomly into two groups: EMG-triggered NMES, and NMES alone. For EMG-triggered NMES, two electrodes from the NMES machine and two EMG electrodes are placed on the wrist extensor muscle of the forearm. The patient relaxes the hand, then contracts the wrist extensor muscle to produce movement. This movement triggers the NMES to deliver enough electrical stimulation to produce maximum wrist extension. For NMES alone, only the two NMES electrodes are placed on the forearm. The patient relaxes the hand and stimulation is applied at an intensity to produce full wrist extension without any patient effort.

At the first clinic visit, baseline hand function is measured with the following tests:

Wrist extension - wrist extension is measured with a digital instrument called an accelerometer
Pinch power - grip strength between thumb and index finger is measured with a digital pinch analyzer
Jebsen-Taylor hand function - function is evaluated through activities such as moving a can and lifting a pin
H reflex - (Note: I could not find a description of this test or its purpose in the consent or the protocol)

In addition, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is done to examine brain activity. For this test, an insulated wire coil is placed on the patient's scalp. A brief electrical current passes through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that travels through the scalp and skull and causes small electrical currents in the outer part of the brain. The stimulation may cause muscle, hand or arm twitching, or may affect movement or reflexes. During the stimulation, electrical activity of muscles are recorded with a computer or other recording device, using electrodes attached to the skin with tape.

Participants will be instructed in how to use the NMES machine at the first visit. They will be required to practice with the machine at home 30 minutes twice a day every day for 4 weeks, for a total of about 56 sessions. Follow-up evaluations of hand function will be done one day after the first NMES or EGM-triggered NMES task, then after 2 weeks and after 4 weeks of performing the exercise. These evaluations include the tests described above for baseline measurements, plus TMS."

NCT05590988,"Hemiparesis is a frequently observed symptom of stroke. There are various therapy options that are used in the rehabilitation of patients. Some studies have shown that, in addition to unilateral arm training, bilateral arm training can also lead to positive results in treatment and is a useful addition to therapy. The newly developed app requires the coordination of both arms in certain time sequences and intensities or rhythms and addresses different sensory modalities (visual, auditory and kinesthetic). The aim of the study is to examine whether tablet-based training improves bimanual coordination."
NCT01149447,"Following a cryptogenic stroke, many patients are nowadays treated with the percutaneous closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO), assuming that the aetiology of the stroke is secondary to a paradoxical embolism. After the PFO closure procedure a dual antiplatelet regimen is often prescribed for 3-6 months and several cardiologic and neurologic follow-up exams are scheduled in the first 12 months of follow-up. Usually a transthoracic +/- transoesophageal echocardiography (TTE +/- TEE) are performed at 6 months, however this kind of control is not systematically performed. In order to improve the clinical outcomes in this young patients' population, the investigators prospectively perform a complete cardiologic and neurologic follow-up program to all patients undergoing a successful percutaneous closure of a PFO.

The aim of these controls is to confirm the good position of the PFO-device, to confirm the absence of any residual right to left shunt or any significant atrial arrhythmias Furthermore this prospective follow-up will analyze the possible mechanisms leading to a cerebral stroke recurrence (e.g. size of the PFO, presence of an atrial septal aneurysm, presence of a residual shunt, size of the utilized closure device, ....)."
NCT00989716,"Nitric oxide is a multimodal candidate treatment for acute stroke having a number of properties which may be beneficial in acute stroke, including lowering blood pressure, causing cerebral vasodilation, and improving central and systemic haemodynamics. Nitric oxide donors are effective in experimental stroke and pilot studies in patients suggest that one, glyceryl trinitrate, can be delivered easily in a transdermal preparation. Around half of all patients admitted with acute stroke are taking antihypertensive therapy immediately prior to their stroke. No data exist as to whether it is beneficial or safe to stop or continue this treatment during the acute phase. ENOS is a prospective, international, multicentre, randomised, parallel-group, blinded, controlled, collaborative, factorial trial designed to test two questions related to the management of blood pressure immediately post-stroke:

The safety and efficacy of nitric oxide, given as transdermal glyceryl trinitrate.
The safety and efficacy of stopping or continuing prior antihypertensive medication.

Previously independent adult patients who are conscious and have residual limb weakness are eligible for enrollment. Central randomisation will be performed via the internet. Treatment is initiated within 48 hours of stroke onset and is given as daily glyceryl trinitrate patches for 7 days. A computed tomography (CT) scan is required within 7 days of randomisation. Early follow-up is performed locally over the 7 days of treatment, including blood pressure, early stroke events, and adverse events. Telephone central follow-up by the trial co-ordinating centre will be performed at 3 months. The primary outcome is combined death or dependency (modified Rankin Score >2)."

Acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) is caused by a severe blockage of an artery leading to immediate reduced blood flow to part of the brain. Standard therapies target the blocked artery by either dissolving the blockage or removing the blockage. However, even after successful treatment, re-blockage of arteries can occur. The use of an antiplatelet therapy, AZD6482, in addition to standard therapies offers the possibility of improved restoration of blood flow and reduced rates of artery re-blockage."

NCT01141738,"Intervention studies for stroke caregivers (CG's) during early caregiving are few and have met with limited success. The Post-Stroke Rehabilitation Clinical Practice Guidelines (1995) recommend sensitivity to the adverse effects of caregiving on family functioning and CG health. Breakdown of the informal care system can lead to premature introduction of formal services, excess disability, and decline in well-being for stroke survivor and CG alike. Thus, it is important to attempt to prevent the chronic distress of stroke CGs through an early intervention that prevents and remediates distress, coaches problem-solving and other coping skills, can affect multiple outcomes, has durable effects, and is non-threatening and accessible. The proposed intervention will incorporate these features and will be low cost and feasible for use in clinical practice; it will target outcomes important to stroke CGs, depression, anxiety, caregiver preparedness, perceptions of life changes, family functioning, and survivor functioning. The individual format will make it possible to address life stage needs and cultural issues. Given the prevalence of distress in chronic stroke CGs, early intervention to prevent and mediate negative outcomes is essential. The proposed study will, therefore test the efficacy of an early intervention for stroke survivor caregivers that provides structured information on problem-solving and resources, guided problem-solving in the context of a supportive relationship, and training in skills to cope with stress and emotions. The intervention will be tailored based on assessment data, will begin during acute rehabilitation and will extend through the most stressful caregiving phase. The study will use a two-group design (the experimental caregiver problem-solving intervention [CPSI] group and a wait-list control [WLC]) group to examine the effectiveness of the CPSI in reducing CG depressive symptoms and anxiety, improving caregiver preparedness, perception of life changes, family functioning, and stroke survivor functional status. Qualitative methods will be used to gain insight into why the CPSI works for some CGs and not others."

NCT05002400,"Numerous patients are addressed to the Emergency Department for unspecific symptoms which can evoke a stroke, such as vertigo, isolated motor deficit, behavior disorder.

For these patients, when they arrive out of time for specific treatments such as thrombolysis and thrombectomy, the cerebral imagery is not an emergency, but necessary to confirm or invalidate the diagnostic of stroke.

If a biomarker could exclude the diagnostic of stroke, we could avoid an imagery for these patients.

PS100B is a biomarker whose blood level increases in case of stroke. It has already proven a prognostic value. Until now, it hasn't proven a diagnostic value because it take a few hours to increase in the blood.

It could have in prognostic value for patients who have the symptoms for more than 24 hours.

STROkE is a diagnostic, prospective, monocentric study, conducted at University Hospital Center of Poitiers (France).

The aim is to determine the value of PS100B to exclude the diagnostic of a stroke in case of evocative symptoms, for patients who are out of delay for a thrombolysis or a thrombectomy.

Patients eligible are the ones who present to the emergency department with symptoms evocative of stroke for more than 24 hours and less than 4 days. Patients included have a sample of blood withdrawn, in order to measure PS100B blood level.

The diagnostic of stroke is than confirmed or excluded by an adjudication comity, who are unaware of the result of PS100B blood level.

NCT01005394,"The past 10 years of research in persons more than 6 months post stroke have shown certain types of rehabilitation can help ""re-wire"" the brain. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be used to monitor this re-wiring by mapping the brain's function (measuring brain activity). Recent research suggests that TMS can be used for both prognosis (determining future function) and to determine what type of rehabilitation therapy will work best after stroke. The purposes of this research study are to: 1) determine changes in brain activity during the first 6 months after stroke (to determine how the brain ""re-wires""); 2) compare changes in recovery of motor function with changes in brain re-wiring; 3) determine the ability of TMS to ""predict"" functional outcome in the first 6 months after stroke.

The primary hypotheses are: 1) functional recovery will be correlated with TMS changes (as measure motor threshold (MT), motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and recruitment curves; 2) baseline TMS will predict future functional outcomes at 3 and 6 months."
NCT01003353,"The study aims to investigate the effects of strength training on maximal strength, walking ability and neural function in chronic stroke patients. The strength training intervention in this study is different to all previous interventions for stroke patients.

Maximal Strength Training (MST) involves weights of up to 90% of the participants 1 repetition maximum and has a focus on the explosive development of force. This study will use these principles for unilateral leg press and plantarflexion exercises. Only 2 previous studies have investigated high intensity strength training for stroke patients and they used intensities of 80% 1RM. Previous MST interventions have shown large increases in strength, rate of force development and this has transferred to improved walking economy.

The investigators predict that MST will give large increases in strength, improved rate of force development (RFD) and walking economy. The investigators expect that better neural function will account for the improvements. This study could provide evidence for the adoption of a completely different method of strength rehabilitation for stroke survivors."

NCT01006993,To assess the safety and feasibility of using the NeuroFlo catheter to treat acute ischemic stroke patients following administration of intravenous tPA.
NCT01006434,"Thrombolysis using Alteplase (tPA) is still the only approved specific therapy for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Current guidelines in western countries recommend an tPA dose of 0.9mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 90mg for patients weighing more than 100kg. However, larger dose-finding rtPA trials for intravenous thrombolysis in AIS are missing. Based on results from research on myocardial infarction only a few open label studies with low case rates were initiated to evaluate the optimal dose for tPA in cerebral ischemia. These studies suggested a narrow therapeutic range with decreased efficacy in lower dosages and an increased risk for thrombolysis related intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) at doses above 0.95mg/kg. The ECASS-1 trial which used a dosage of 1.1mg/kg rt-PA showed significantly higher rate of large parenchymal hemorrhages compared to trials using 0.9mg/kg. Therefore accurate dosing is crucial. In the acute phase two aspects complicate rtPA dosing in AIS: First, unlike in other diseases many stroke patients are unable to communicate information on their body weight (BW) because of their stroke symptoms (e.g. aphasia, decreased consciousness). In addition motor symptoms prohibit easy weighing procedures in many patients. Second, the ultra-early and narrow time window for treatment does not allow time loss to weigh each patient in the emergency situation. Therefore routinely the attending physician has to make a visual estimation of the patient's BW. This may be inaccurate and may cause dosing errors which has been shown for other weight based emergency medication. There is little data on tPA-dosing errors in stroke patients and prospective data are lacking. The aim of our study is to evaluate availability of BW-information, accuracy of estimations and final dosing of tPA in a routine clinical setting. Therefore the investigators evaluate different sources of body weight estimations and also compare visual estimation with recently proposed anthropometric measurements for body weight approximation. Finally, impact of dosing errors on safety and efficacy are analyzed.

The initial phase will consist of 100 enrolled patients as a pilot phase for further power calculations. Based on the results of the pilot phase enrollment will continue. The envisioned inclusion target is up to 800 patients."
NCT01006772,"Stroke is a major cause of disabilities worldwide. Stroke survivors commonly exhibit walking defects which lead to an altered, slow speed and asymmetric gait pattern. The main aims of rehabilitation are to enhance recovery of movement control and regain walking ability. Ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs), braces which encompass the foot and ankle joint extending to a point below the knee, are commonly prescribed to address ambulation impairments in stroke patients. Their main function is to support the foot and allow a subject to walk safely with a gait approaching normality. This project will aim to evaluate the early provision of AFOs as an adjunct to standard physiotherapy on the walking ability of stroke survivors. Usual rehabilitation practice will be the control condition. Participants will be recruited from the stroke unit of Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow. They will be randomised into two groups. Participants allocated in the control group will receive usual clinical practice as per routine for stroke patients. The intervention group will receive custom made solid AFOs as an adjunct. They will be provided with three AFOs, one for use during rehabilitation and two which will be used only during the outcome assessment sessions for research purposes. The intervention phase will last 24 weeks. Gait analysis will be performed three times for each participant (at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks after enrolment) in the biomechanical laboratory of Strathclyde University. During these sessions force and movement data of patients walking will be recorded. Fortnightly time and distance factors of gait will be measured and a battery of functional tasks will be performed in the physiotherapy gym of the hospital using a simple video camera and a grid lino-mat. During all assessments participants with an AFO will be asked to walk with and without the AFO provided."

NCT01020851,"National recommendations state that patients with a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke should receive hypertension treatment, including antihypertensive medication and lifestyle modification, with a goal of reducing blood pressure (BP) to <120 mm Hg systolic BP and <80 mm Hg diastolic BP. Statin treatment and lifestyle modification is also recommended for post-stroke and post-TIA patients with elevated cholesterol levels or a history of stroke or TIA with an atherosclerotic cause. Despite the clear benefits of secondary stroke prevention, there is a gap between evidence and implementation in clinical practice. By a randomized controlled trial, the investigators will test whether a tailored, telephone-delivered transtheoretical model-based behavioral intervention will improve adherence to treatment in veterans with a history of TIA or stroke, thereby leading to better control of BP and cholesterol levels, as compared to an attention placebo.

The primary specific aims of this project are to:

determine whether a behaviorally tailored intervention (TI) can effectively lower BP after 6 months of counseling as compared to an attention placebo (AP) in veterans with a history of stroke or TIA
assess whether the TI is effective in improving adherence to diet after 6 months of counseling in veterans with a history of stroke or TIA.

Secondary aims are to

assess whether the TI is effective in improving cholesterol levels in post-stroke veterans after 6 months
evaluate whether the TI is effective in improving adherence to antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications after 6 months of counseling in veterans with a history of stroke or TIA
determine whether the TI is effective in improving adherence to exercise recommendations after 6 months.

To answer this, veterans (n=190) with a history of stroke or TIA will be randomized equally to the TI, which will use the transtheoretical framework to provide 6 monthly counseling phone sessions about adherence to diet, medication, and exercise recommendations, and the AP, in which 6 monthly counseling phone sessions about non-stroke-related health topics will be provided. Participants will make in-person visits at baseline and 6 months. BP (3 measures taken at least 5 min apart) and dietary sodium are the primary outcomes, while secondary outcomes will be total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein ratio, adherence to antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs, and exercise adherence."

NCT00084292,"The International Pediatric Stroke Study (IPSS) was established in 2003 as a multi-center, multi-national clinical research registry. Over the years, it has grown to become a highly successful study vehicle for pediatric stroke research across over 100 institutions worldwide. Today, The IPSS continues to serve as the global data and imaging core for multi-disciplinary pediatric experts who perform international collaborative research in an effort to better understand, prevent, and improve outcomes in pediatric stroke. The robust dataset and cohesive network enable high caliber and ground-breaking research in the field.

Participating sites enroll neonates or children who have had an ischemic stroke or are at high risk of having a stroke into the registry. Participants have their medical and research records reviewed for information about their stroke and abstracted into a secure electronic database called REDCap. The IPSS also provides an attractive imaging platform (through the Stroke Imaging Lab for Children, SILC, housed at SickKids) for sites to share clinically acquired brain images that will complement the clinical dataset. The clinical and imaging datasets will improve our understanding of the processes underlying plasticity and recovery in childhood stroke.

All information captured in the study is de-identified.

This study does not require any interventions or additional visits for research. Two outcome measures are typically administered during a follow-up clinic visit: the Paediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM) and the Recovery and Recurrence Questionnaire (RRQ). The PSOM is used during clinic visits by the study PI or co-investigator; the RRQ is a parental questionnaire that can be completed during clinic visits or by telephone interview for those parents who cannot attend the follow up appointment. Both measures assess neurological function in the following 5 domains: sensory, motor, language, cognition and behavior.

Participating investigators will retain ownership of their own (single-site) data. However, by entering data into the IPSS, co-investigators give implicit permission for the IPSS to analyze the collective dataset. These contributing investigators are recognized through authorship.

The activities of the network are creating the opportunity for manuscript writing, grant development and collaboration on clinical challenges in pediatric stroke."

NCT01157195,"Constraint-Induced Movement therapy, also known as CI therapy, is an approach to physical rehabilitation derived from basic behavioral and neuroscience research. It has been shown to be efficacious for rehabilitating use of the more-affected arm in individuals more than one year after stroke with mild to moderate motor impairment. The first component of the therapy is intensive training in use of the more-affected arm on functional tasks for 3 hours daily for 10 consecutive weekdays. The second is wearing a protective safety mitt on the less-affected hand for all waking hours of the approximately 2-week treatment period that it is safe to do so. The purpose of the mitt is to discourage use of the less-affected arm. The third is a group of behavioral techniques designed to transfer gains from the treatment setting to the real world, which takes a therapist, on average, 30 minutes to implement on each treatment day.

These recordings are transmitted via telephone to a secure encrypted Internet site. Within these 30 days the participants also perform an ambulatory 24 hour Holter recording. Handheld ECG recordings are evaluated continuously. In case of atrial fibrillation the patient is informed and offered treatment with anti coagulant medication (Warfarin). The investigation is a comparison between 24 hour continuous ECG recordings and short intermittent ECG recordings twice daily over a longer time period to determine which method is the best to detect atrial fibrillation in this patient group.

NCT01189058,"Newborn stroke is the leading cause of a common type of cerebral palsy (CP) that affects thousands of Canadian children and families. Treatments for CP are generally ineffective, and have traditionally focused on the weak body rather than the injured brain. Understanding how the newborn brain responds to injuries like stroke (plasticity) carries the greatest potential for better treatments. We propose to study the ability of two interventions to modulate brain plasticity toward better function in children with stroke-induced CP. One is a rehabilitation method called constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), the other is a type of non-invasive brain stimulation called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is safe and comfortable for children and we recently showed it could improve motor function in children with stroke.

We will perform a special study to test both treatments simultaneously. Children 7-18 years with stroke-induced CP will be recruited into the study from across Alberta. Each child will randomly receive either TMS, CIMT, both, or neither each day for two weeks while attending our new HemiKids Power Camp for motor learning. Improvements will be measured by trained therapists over 1 year. TMS will also measure brain plasticity, both initially and following treatment. Our lead investigator is an expert in both newborn stroke and TMS and has assembled an experienced team of accomplished collaborators to ensure the completion of this important work. This will be the largest study of children with CP examined in this manner. This will be the first clinical trial of non-invasive brain stimulation (TMS) in CP, the largest trial of CIMT (and the first exclusive to newborn stroke), and the first study allowing the direct comparison of two different therapies. In establishing the first dedicated pediatric TMS laboratory in Canada, we will be the first to measure plasticity changes in newborn stroke, advancing new treatments of this previously untreatable and disabling disease.

Patient recruitment is currently underway at Alberta Children's Hospital. Application is currently underway to expand recruitment to Northern Alberta through the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital and Stollery Children's Hospital, to enable patients from Northern Alberta greater opportunity to participate as subjects in this study."
NCT01198496,"Objectives and Hypothesis

Objectives:

This study evaluates whether strict BP management is useful for the prevention of recurrent stroke.

Hypertensive patients with history of stroke are treated with stepwise multi-drug therapy to achieve stricter BP target <120/80 mmHg in the strict BP control group and less stricter BP target <140/90 mmHg or <130/80 mmHg for patients with current DM/CKD/MI in the standard BP control group. The participants under the BP treatment achieving their respective BP target will be followed for recurrence of stroke. The study continues until the number of patients with the first recurrent stroke reaches a total of 330 between the two groups. The occurrence rates of recurrent stroke will be compared between the two groups.

Hypotheses The incidence of recurrent stroke will be lower in a strict BP control group having lower BP target: <120/80 mmHg* than in a standard BP control group having BP target <140/90 mmHg or <130/80 mmHg for current DM/CKD/MI in patients with hypertension.
Study design This will be a multicenter, randomized, open-label study. The study consists of a screening period, a titration period and a follow-up period. The screening period is a period between the date of consent and the enrollment date. Hypertensive patients with history of stroke are randomly assigned to either the strict BP control group having the target of <120/80 mmHg or the standard BP control group having the target of <140/90 mmHg without current DM, CKD or MI and <130/80 mmHg with current DM, CKD or MI. The titration period is the period finding a treatment which achieves target BP, and 24 weeks at maximum. Patients will be treated with stepwise multi-drug therapy using an angiotensin-receptor antagonist, diuretic, calcium channel blocker and aldosterone antagonist. The participants will be observed under the BP management for their respective BP target. The study will be continued until the number of patients with the first recurrent stroke reaches a total of 330 between two groups. The follow-up period will be 3 years.

The recurrent rates of stroke in both groups will be compared from various aspects, and strict BP management will be investigated on the usefulness in prevention of recurrent stroke."

The study will be conducted over a period of 1 day and each participant can anticipate the testing to take approximately 120 minutes.
NCT00172289,"According to the theory of wave transmission, the speed of wave transmission is dependent on the nature of the transmission medium, which is the vessel wall for pulse wave transmission. Then, the pulse wave velocity is related to the mechanical property of the vessel wall. The mechanical property of the vessel wall is determined by the texture of the vessel wall and the contraction status of the smooth muscle within the vessel wall. Because the texture of the vessel wall could not be changed in a short duration, the sympathetic nerve activity, which controls the contractibility of the smooth muscle, becomes the only determinant factor of pulse wave velocity. So, pulse wave velocity may reflect the status of sympathetic nerve activity. The purpose of this project is to use the pulse wave velocity to measure the sympathetic activity of stroke and spinal cord patients. The present project plans to measure the pulse wave simultaneously at four limbs by pressure receptors, and use the electrocardiogram as the reference to synchronize the recorded pulse wave at different vessels, using the corrected data to calculate the pulse wave velocity. With the pulse wave velocity of different vessels, we, the investigators at National Taiwan University Hospital, can understand the local sympathetic nerve activity in different diseases and different sites.

The first year, we will set up the equipment for measuring the pulse wave velocity, and then apply it to 20 healthy subjects to adjust the measurement error and ascertain the reproducibility of the machine. The second year, we will apply the measurement to 15 complete cervical cord injury individuals and 15 healthy subjects in different erected angles by a tilting table. This procedure will make us understand the response of sympathetic nerve activity to different postures in normal subjects and cervical cord injury patients. The third year, we will apply the measurement to 30 cerebrovascular accident patients to understand the change of sympathetic nerve activity after having a stroke. By comparing the clinical information, we hope to clear up the relationship between sympathetic nerve activity and pulse wave velocity."

NCT05419791,"The effectiveness of applying robot-assisted walking training together with conventional physiotherapy is widely accepted. Virtual reality is another component and its contribution to rehabilitation is important. When we look at the literature on virtual reality applications on balance and walking, it is seen that some systems are beneficial while some systems have no effect. This raises the possibility that virtual reality applications may produce different results due to the task in the exercise, patient motivation or any other reason. There is a need to investigate whether virtual reality applications have different effects, if any, what is the source of this and what care should be taken in the development of these applications in the future. Therefore, we focused on investigating the different effects of Lokomat virtual reality applications."

NCT03181412,"The effectiveness of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) management has improved considerably in recent years with thrombolysis and more recently with mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Currently, mechanical thrombectomy can only be performed in stroke unit with an interventional neuroradiology center by experienced/qualified interventional neuroradiologists. In the Rhone area, only one hospital has the authorization to perform mechanical thrombectomy. Therefore, transferring directly eligible acute ischemic stroke patients for mechanical thrombectomy to this center constitutes an important stake of the triage of suspected acute ischemic stroke patients. Some validated scores for the identification of severe strokes and large vessel occlusion, including the Cincinnati prehospital stroke severity scale (CPSSS), appear to be relevant for pre-hospital use in order to identify patients potentially eligible for mechanical thrombectomy and address them to a stoke unit with interventional radiology center."

NCT02949609,"After stroke, patients frequently suffer from arm or hand weakness. There are numerous rehabilitation methods to stimulate recovery, amongst which mirror therapy (MT). It is particularly interesting in cases for which impairment is severe, as many other forms of therapy are often impossible.

During MT, a mirror is placed in the midsagittal plane, so as to hide the impaired limb. Thereafter, the subject is asked to move his unimpaired limb while looking at its reflection in the mirror, thereby creating the illusion that the contralateral, impaired limb is moving.

The objective of this study is to better determine the efficacy of MT. The investigators will therefore compare recovery of arm function in two groups of patient, that perform a regimen of 30 minutes of therapy, 5 times a week, for 4 weeks on top of conventional therapy. One group performs MT and the other one performs a therapy in which the same movements are performed, but without the use of a mirror, with unrestricted view of both limbs. Allocation to each group will be randomized. Arm function will be evaluated by use of a scale before, during and after the 4 week period. The assessor for the primary outcome measure will not know in which group the patient is. There will be a total of 30 patients included over a one year study period."

NCT05418335,"Stroke is a common, serious and restrictive global health problem. Restricting the activities of daily living of stroke patients impairs patients' ability to pay attention to oral hygiene. Facial paresis and tongue weakness due to stroke may cause a decrease in the control of dental prostheses and the removal of food residues in the oral cavity. Food residues and saliva contaminated with bacteria as a result of poor oral hygiene can result in pneumonia when aspirated due to oropharyngeal dysphagia. In the literature, it has been shown that there are significant relationships between periodontal health and vitamin D and calcium intake, and that dietary supplementation with calcium and vitamin D can improve periodontal health, increase bone mineral density in the mandible, and inhibit alveolar bone resorption. In line with all these data, our hypothesis in this study is to investigate the relationship between oral health and vitamin D levels in stroke patients in rehabilitation units."

NCT05549141,"Introduction: Stroke is one of the major causes of morbidity/mortality in the world and affected individuals, due to important (mainly motor) impairments, have their physical capacity to exercise reduced, a fact that aggravates the cardiovascular risk factors already installed. For this reason, a cardiovascular rehabilitation program, in addition to motor rehabilitation, must be added to the life of this individual. Objective: To verify the cardiovascular and metabolic effects of treadmill gait training associated with functional electrical stimulation in individuals after stroke. Method: This study will be an analysis based on archived data from the project ""Functional electrical stimulation during gait training in people after stroke"" approved by the CEP with CAAE number: 52079115.4.0000.5515. Such analyzes have not been carried out before and they will enable the discussion of other important points for the scientific community and health professionals. The study included 20 adults (aged between 45 and 59 years) and elderly individuals (aged between 60 and 70 years) with sequelae of hemiparesis due to stroke, of both sexes. To assess functional capacity, the 6-minute walk test was performed and, from this, the Double product, VO2max and metabolic consumption units (METs) will be estimated in this research. There were two protocols (Group A and B) formed by two training phases alternating between moments with and without electrical stimulation (WalkAide), consisting of 12 sessions, twice a week and lasting 30 minutes. In each session before and after training, the participants remained seated at rest for 10 minutes, for the collection of cardiorespiratory parameters and heart rate variability. During training on a treadmill with or without electrical stimulation, heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) were monitored, and a detailed analysis of HRV will be carried out in this research. Data will be analyzed and statistically treated, considering a significance level of p<0.05."
NCT05559398,"Emergent reperfusion is the main goal for acute ischemic stroke therapy (AIS). Endovascular therapy (EVT) is recommended within 6 hrs of stroke onset, and up to 24 hrs following perfusion imaging criteria.

Despite the major benefit associated with MT, more than 50% of the patients remain disabled at 3 months. Reperfusion rates after MT are critical to determine functional outcome. However, complete reperfusion is obtained in only 50 % of the patients, due to, at least in part, erratic emboli and/or no-reflow processes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of glenzocimab in addition to EVT and compared to EVT plus placebo, whether or not associated with ntravenous thrombolysis (IVT), on functional outcome at day 90."

NCT02597569,"Patients with cognitive impairments following a stroke are often denied access to inpatient rehabilitation, despite evidence of its benefits for them. Patients with cognitive impairment who are admitted to inpatient stroke rehabilitation often receive services based on outdated impairment-reduction models, rather than recommended function-based approaches. These two issues, reduced access to rehabilitation and the knowledge-to-practice gap, both stem from a reported lack of skills and knowledge on the part of some stroke rehabilitation teams to foster recovery in people with cognitive impairments. To address these issues, the investigators will implement and evaluate a multi-faceted, supported, integrated knowledge translation initiative, targeted specifically at the inter-professional application of the Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP), called CO-OP KT. CO-OP is a contemporary, effective, cognitive strategy-based treatment approach. CO-OP KT is a combination of the CO-OP Approach with multi-faceted knowledge translation support. Clinical staff at participating institutions will receive CO-OP KT training.

The long-term objective of CO-OP KT is to optimize functional outcomes for individuals with stroke and cognitive impairments. Three specific research questions have been posed, one of which is the focus of this registration. That sub study relates to patient outcomes following the CO-OP KT training initiative and it will be addressed using a non-randomized design with historical controls. Patient participants who enroll in the project prior to implementing the CO-OP KT training will belong to the historical control group. Patient participants who enroll in the project after the CO-OP KT training will belong to the CO-OP KT Exposure group."
NCT02132650,"The VHA estimates that over 15,000 Veterans incur a stroke each year. As the population of older Veterans grows, stroke will become an increasingly important problem to the VHA. Recovery of walking function is the most common goal of stroke survivors. The proposed study will test whether training with accurate walking tasks to engage the damaged supraspinal motor pathways is more effective than training with steady state walking. The investigators expect that training accurate tasks will be more effective, thereby improving walking function of Veteran stroke survivors and reducing the burden of care placed on families and on the VHA. Furthermore, this rehabilitation approach can be accomplished at comparable cost to existing rehabilitation approaches, which is important given that the VHA invests $88 million per year toward outpatient care, including physical rehabilitation, in the first six months after stroke. This research also has implications for rehabilitation of other neurologically injured populations, including traumatic brain injury and incomplete spinal cord injury."

NCT00814177,"Warfarin is very effective for the prevention of blood clots (thrombosis). A test of coagulation, the prothrombin time (PT) is used to monitor the effect. The PT response to warfarin can fluctuate as a result of interactions with a large number of other drugs, food or herbal agents as well as for no apparent reason. Thus, frequent monitoring of the PT and dose adjustments according to the results are required. One third of our patients remain on the same maintenance dose over 6 months. However, also these patients sometimes have a PT result moderately outside the therapeutic range without any obvious explanation. Too short PTs may be due to missed dose(s) or more dark green vegetables in the diet. Too long PTs may be due to a course of antibiotic therapy or less dark green vegetables. Laboratory errors may also occur and can cause deviations in any direction. Most likely, unnoticed fluctuations in the PT occur as well between the time points of monitoring.

There are no guidelines on how to manage the treatment in this situation but there are some typical ""behaviours"".

Behavior A: Some physicians simply let the patient continue with the same dose. ""It is extremely unlikely that the very temporary dose adjustment has any effect on the PT result 4 weeks later and this is a ""cosmetic procedure""."" Behavior B: Others recommend the patients to take ½ - 1 additional dose in case of short PT and to skip a dose or take half dose in case of long PT, and thereafter to continue with the usual dose. ""The investigators need to quickly correct the temporary aberration in order to avoid thrombotic or bleeding complications the next few days.

This may seem like an issue of no importance. The investigators are however performing a series of studies to evaluate if these stable patients can be managed with blood tests less often than every 4 weeks. For that purpose it is important to know how often and why aberrant results occur, the implication and to what extent they can be ignored.

The investigators hypothesis is that in patients with very stable PT-results and unchanged dose for 3 months, should continue with exactly the same maintenance dose, even when the result unexpectedly is slightly above or below the therapeutic range. The investigators believe that most of these occasional PT-results outside the therapeutic range are due to laboratory errors, perhaps missed doses by the patient or temporary change in diet or medications."

NCT00101543,"Conventional rehabilitation does not restore normal, safe gait to many stroke survivors. Functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) using intramuscular (IM) electrodes (FNS-IM) improved persistent gait deficits for patients with chronic stroke (1-7 years post stroke), but required a long protocol of 6-18 months. For chronic deficits, a shortened response to treatment (3 months) was obtained by combining FNS-IM with body weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT). Gains included strength, coordination, gait kinematics, walking endurance, and quality of life. Gait deficits treated in the chronic phase are more resistant to treatment than in the early recovery phase, because chronic, abnormal movement patterns are more ingrained. Therefore, during the early recovery phase, it is likely that a relatively greater treatment response will be obtained. The purpose of the proposed work is to test the combination FNS-IM + BWSTT during the early recovery phase following stroke. Hypothesis I is: FNS-IM + BWSTT will restore volitional gait more completely for subjects during the early recovery phase following stroke, compared to BWSTT alone. Subjects will be admitted at 1-11 months after stroke. Thirty five subjects will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups. They will be treated for 48 sessions, four sessions/week. Primary outcome measures will be: kinematic swing phase gait components, energy cost of gait, and an index of walking endurance. Secondary outcome measures will be kinematic stance phase gait components and gait speed. The second set of hypotheses will test the relationship between restoration of mobility and measurements of impairment, function and quality of life."

NCT00792428,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether a non-painful, non-invasive, brain-stimulation technique called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with traditional physical-occupational therapy (OT) will improve motor function in patients with chronic stroke. The aim is to determine the effect of applying real (anodal and/or cathodal) - in a dual configuration - vs sham (pretend) tDCS to the motor brain regions on both hemispheres - in a dual configuration - to improve motor function in chronic stroke patients. Our research in normal subjects has shown that motor skills can be enhanced if tDCS is applied to the brain's motor region during motor learning. The effects after a single session of tDCS can last for up to 30 minutes, effects of multiple sessions (one session per day) can last for weeks. Furthermore, single sessions of tDCS applied to the motor regions in stroke patients have shown that improvements in motor functions can be seen and that effects may last for at least 30 minutes. Patients enrolled in this trial will be randomized to receive either real tDCS or sham tDCS in combination with PT-OT once a day for 5 days. Assessments will be done about 3 days and 7 days after the end of the experimental treatment by investigators who are blinded to the intervention. Patients are also blinded as to whether they are receiving real or sham tDCS. We hypothesize that real tDCS applied to the motor regions in combination with PT-OT results in a subsequent improvement in motor function of the recovering hand over sham tDCS in combination with PT-OT."

NCT04387162,"Of the 15,000 Veterans who are hospitalized for stroke each year more than half experience spatial and motor impairments and pain. Spatial-motor-sensory problems limit functioning and independence, which is costly to Veterans, their families, and society. Currently, spatial-motor-sensory problems are targeted using different treatments. However, there is a treatment that has shown promise in simultaneously targeting spatial function, motor function and pain in right-brain stroke. The investigators propose to investigate the feasibility of using adapted spatial-motor sensory assessment and treatment procedures for Veterans with left-brain stroke who have language and cognitive impairment. The next step will be to conduct a large-scale study focused on this multi-target treatment for more efficient and effective stroke rehabilitation. The investigators expect this line of research to increase functioning, independence and quality of life in Veteran stroke survivors."
NCT02540096,"Stroke is a neurovascular event characterized by impaired blood supply to the brain due to rupture or obstruction of certain cerebral arteries, which often results in hemiparesis and can affect individuals of any age and sex, being prevalent in the elderly population.

Among the main treatments available for stroke rehabilitation, most of them demands an appropriate structure and high-qualified personnel. Searching for more affordable treatment options, several studies suggest the use of mental practice with motor imagery as a potential therapeutic tool, since it can be performed at any place or any time the patient wishes, including their own homes.

Motor imagery can be defined as the covert cognitive process of imagining a movement of your own body(-part) without actually moving that body(-part).

NCT00991029,"A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a transient episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction. An ischemic stroke is a cerebral infarction. In POINT, eligibility is limited to brain TIAs and to minor ischemic strokes (with an NIH Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score less than or equal to 3).

TIAs are common [25], and are often harbingers of disabling strokes. Approximately 250,000-350,000 TIAs are diagnosed each year in the US. Given median survival of more than 8 years [32], there are approximately 2.4 million TIA survivors. In a national survey, one in fifteen of those over 65 years old reported a history of TIA [33], which is equivalent to a prevalence of 2.3 million in older Americans. Based on the prevalence of undiagnosed transient neurological events, the true incidence of TIA may be twice as high as the rates of diagnosis [33]. Based on our review of the National Inpatient Sample for 1997-2003, there were an average of 200,000 hospital admissions for TIA each year, with annual charges climbing quickly in the period to $2.6 billion in 2003.

NCT02150785,"Currently, thrombolysis is offered to less than 1% of patients in low to middle income countries (LMICs) where access to health care is often based on the financial capabilities of the patient. There is therefore an urgent need for an effective but affordable alternative thrombolytic agent. Streptokinase (SK) ($35) is much more economically feasible as opposed to tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) ($2800). In this study, we propose a reevaluation of the use of streptokinase (SK) in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. We want to emphasize that we will only consider this as a 'treatment option' if we are absolutely certain that IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) will not be offered to the patient due to its high cost.

Navigation guided rTMS requires a structural MRI scan for targeting stimulation and therefore structural MRI will be performed on all subjects. In addition the study intends to determine whether measures of motor tract integrity (MTI) assessed by navigated brain stimulation (NBS) and MRI diffusion tensor imaging can be used to clarify prognosis of motor recovery and to monitor progress with rehabilitation. 30 subjects with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke 3-9 months prior to enrollment and with residual upper limb hemiplegia will be randomized to receive either 1 Hz rTMS to the contralesional hemisphere for 30 minutes 3 times a week for 6 weeks along with rehabilitation therapy or sham rTMS to the contralesional hemisphere for 30 minutes 3 times a week for 6 weeks along with rehabilitation therapy.

NCT03154138,"Postural imbalance after stroke leads to limitations of activity and a worse autonomy. The postural imbalance is increased in right supratensorial stroke (RSS) compared to left supratensorial stroke. The evidences for the rehabilitation of postural imbalance are weak.

Likewise, disorders of spatial reference frames are increased in RSS. The postural imbalance is correlated with the disorders of spatial reference frames in RSS patients.

Prismatic adaptation (PA) is often used for the rehabilitation of unilateral spatial neglect after RSS. Several studies have demonstrated a peculiar expansion of sensorimotor after-effects to spatial cognition. An immediate effect of reduction in postural imbalance have been showed in acute RSS. Therefore, it is interested to investigate the immediate and delayed effects of PA on the postural balance and the spatial reference frames in chronic RSS to purpose a new therapeutic approach.

The hypothesis of the study is that PA would improve the postural balance (activity) of chronic RSS patients by a reduction in mediolateral postural asymmetry, resulting from a "" bottom-up "" action of PA on spatial reference frames."

NCT01047709,"Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and the third leading cause of death in the United States. Unfortunately, there are few therapies that have been proven to improve stroke outcome. Sleep apnea is an emerging stroke risk factor and has a well established association with higher mortality and poor functional outcome following stroke. Over half of acute stroke patients have sleep apnea, suggesting that it may be a important target for therapy. Attenuation of sleep apnea severity may result in improved stroke outcomes. However, the standard treatment for sleep apnea is not well-tolerated among stroke patients. An alternative treatment is avoidance of supine sleep. Supine sleep is very common in acute stroke patients, and therefore this treatment may have particular relevance to the stroke population. The proposed study will be conducted in two phases. The first phase is a randomized, crossover design in which acute stroke patients will be given positional treatment (to avoid supine sleep) on one night during their stroke hospitalization. This will be compared with another night of sleeping without positional therapy. The order of treatments (standard vs positional therapy) will be random. The first phase will demonstrate the proof of concept: that stroke patients given positional therapy to avoid supine sleep will (1) sleep less on their backs, and (2) will have improved sleep apnea parameters with positional therapy. In the second phase, those identified to have sleep apnea will be randomized to receive positional therapy at home for three months, or standard therapy. This second phase will demonstrate the adherence/feasibility of three months of positional therapy, and will allow us to estimate effect size based on a functional outcome measure. The data obtained from this pilot clinical trial are essential to plan a large efficacy study."
NCT00108030,"The specific aim of this project is to improve walking ability in persons following stroke using 'treadmill training plus power training'. This modality addresses the two major impairments followings stroke: weakness and incoordination, as well as loss of fitness. Importantly, this training will be presented at higher intensity and greater volume than is currently received. Furthermore, to ensure that persons continue to maintain the level of improvement from an intensive exercise program, we will also implement a behavioral change for long-term maintenance of exercise behavior in a less supervised environment. A randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted in 102 sub-acute stroke patients to ascertain the efficacy of this approach to improving walking ability.

Hypotheses:

Walking endurance will be increased to a greater degree in a patient group receiving treadmill plus muscle power training compared with a treadmill training only group, or 'usual care' group.
Gait stability, muscle function, aerobic fitness and balance will improve more in a group receiving treadmill plus muscle power training, than either those in treadmill training or usual care patient groups.
Habitual activity levels will be higher in the group receiving treadmill plus muscle power training compared with a treadmill training only group or 'usual care' group.
The change in 6-minute walk distance will be positively related to changes in muscle power, strength and endurance, aerobic fitness, gait mechanics, and balance.
Baseline depression and low self-efficacy will be associated with less robust adaptations to all types of training and lower rates of long-term compliance to the exercise prescription in the experimental groups."

NCT01062308,"Background and Rationale: The most commonly seen disabilities in stroke patients are shoulder injuries such as shoulder pain, glenohumeral subluxation, spasticity of shoulder muscles, soft-tissue trauma, rotator cuff tears, and shoulder-hand syndrome.

Taping is widely used in the field of rehabilitation as both means of treatment and prevention of sports related injuries. Scarce information is available regarding the use of shoulder taping in preventing shoulder injuries in stroke patients. Aims:

To find out the effectiveness of taping technique with conventional treatment versus sham taping and conventional treatment in prevention of shoulder injuries in patients with acute stroke.

Hypothesis:

Taping technique with conventional treatment will be superior to conventional treatment alone in preventing shoulder injuries in patients with acute stroke.

Methods Research setting: Stroke unit, department of Neurology, Christian Medical College (CMC) Ludhiana, Punjab, India and College of Physiotherapy, CMC Ludhiana.

Study design: prospective, randomized, outcome blinded trial (PROBE design). Study period: Prospective for 18 months from May 2009 All stroke patients with upper limb weakness within 48 hours after the ictus and with Brunnstrom's stage of recovery 1 and 2 will be included in the study. Patients will be randomized into two groups using lottery method. The treatment arm group(Group I) include shoulder taping with conventional techniques that is(positioning, handling technique and passive range of motion exercises) and the control arm (Group II) include sham taping with conventional techniques with sham taping. A total of 80 patients in each group will be included. The plastic micropore and elastic adhesive tape will be used for taping the affected shoulder. The sham taping will be done using the same tapes but without stretching the concerned muscles and joints. The tapes will be changed every 3 days and will remain for 14 days.

NCT04063995,"The reticulospinal pathway (RSP) is at the center of spasticity mechanism. The RSP indirectly synapses with motor neurons via interneurons in the ventromedial intermediate zone in both halves of the spinal cord, and directly synapses with motor neurons of proximal extremity muscles. The main motor cortex region controlling unilateral RSP is the premotor cortex. That is, a single limb is represented in both premotor cortices. This suggests theoretically that if the corticoreticular pathway controlling RSP is modulated by dorsal premotor cortex stimulation, there may be a change in the regulation of the intraspinal network regulating the stretch reflex. Therefore, the hypothesis in this study is that the application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the contralesional dorsal premotor cortex in chronic stroke patients changes the severity of spasticity."

NCT00109382,"Current management of patients with TIA (transient ischemic attack) or minor stroke includes the prompt investigation and treatment in the days and weeks after the event. However, new evidence shows patients are at the highest risk of stroke in the first few days after the TIA, with 50% of strokes which happen in the three months following TIA occurring within 48-72 hours. To date, there is no evidence to guide physicians on how to safely reduce this risk.

The FASTER trial is focusing on the initial period of high risk, starting patients on stroke prevention treatments in the hours following a TIA or minor stroke. The drugs to be tested have been shown to be effective in the similar setting of cardiology, reducing recurrent cardiac events in patients with unstable angina when commenced with the same speed after an event.

All patients will be on aspirin. The trial will see if adding another drug, clopidogrel, has an additional benefit in reducing the number of strokes after TIA or minor stroke within three months of TIA or minor stroke. It will also look if the very early introduction of simvastatin, a cholesterol lowering therapy, reduces stroke after TIA or minor stroke, both by itself and in addition to clopidogrel. The final aim of the trial is to ensure that these treatments are safe to be used in this population of patients."

NCT02523261,"Mechanical thrombectomy (TM) is now validated through 4 randomized controlled trials of high scientific level as the reference treatment of cerebral infarction associated with proximal cerebral occlusion (MR CLEAN, ESCAPE 2014, 2015). These studies have shown for the first time a major decrease (-35%) of disability related to severe cerebral infarction and reduction in mortality. These studies only used thrombectomy devices called stent retriever for obtaining recanalization rates ranging from 58-72% for the 2 largest studies (MR CLEAN, ESCAPE 2014, 2015). This criterion ""recanalization"" is important because it largely determines the functional prognosis of patients with severe cerebral infarction (Khatri, 2014).

These results are exciting but we can do even better. Indeed, already new thrombectomy devices are available with a special interest for ADAPT (A Direct Aspiration First Pass Technic). This distal suction system, with a high level of endovascular navigability, provides high recanalization rates (> 90%), low morbidity, with a synergistic effect with stent retriever (Turk A, Kowoll 2014 and 2015). To date, these technic (ADAPT) has never been assessed in a randomized controlled trial.

We have previously conducted a comparative observational study between two recanalization strategies by thrombectomy using first-line ADAPT or the most widely used stent retriever. The interventional neuroradiologist could, in case of recanalization failure with the Solitaire system, used another thrombectomy material left to the operator's choice. 244 consecutive patients on two centers (Rothschild Foundation, and Foch Hospital, France) admitted for a cerebral infarction associated with proximal occlusion were included. This is so far the largest series of patients with ADAPT system. The complete recanalization rate was 84% with ADAPT versus 68% with stent retriever (P = 0.006).

NCT01161329,"Chronic conditions such as stroke are associated with physical disability and an economic burden for the family and the society. A medical approach is often not sufficient to address the bio-psychological process of chronic disease. Behavioural medicine approaches are often needed to improve the treatment outcomes.

In this project the combined approach of behavioural medicine principles and physical training will be tried on patients who have had a stroke one year ago where it has yet only been used scarcely. As the study focus on the individuals' ability to function and be active the primary outcome measure is disability.

However, the optimal treatment of acute stroke patients with TL remains uncertain, as relatively few patients with TL were included in the major randomized controlled trials of EVT and management of the c-ICA was generally not specified by protocol nor analyzed post-hoc.

Recent large multi-centre retrospective cases series suggest that acutely stented patients may have more favorable outcomes than patients treated with angioplasty alone or those with no acute ICA intervention, but high quality randomized trial data are lacking.

NCT01350453,"When a person has had a stroke they often lose their confidence, motivation and the ability to move one arm and hand. Recent research has shown that intensive exercise assists recovery of movement, but people are often discouraged by slow progress and stop using their weak limb.

A new idea, called Constraint Induced Therapy (CIT), has been shown to overcome this habitual 'non-use'. CIT involves wearing a mitt on the unaffected hand for several hours a day to prevent it from being used. Use of the weak arm and hand is encouraged by intensive exercises. CIT is not available in the NHS because of lack of therapist time for supervision and patients lack the confidence and motivation to carry out CIT alone at home.

This study will have two stages.

Stage 1.

The aim of this part of the study is to develop a web-based therapy programme ('LifeCIT') to support patients carrying out CIT at home (with their carer where possible) with online therapist support. The investigators will develop the therapy programme working closely with at least 12 patients, 6 carers and 6 therapists to identify and resolve any problems.

Stage 2

The investigators will then carry out a pilot trial in 6 treatment centers with 20 patients who have just been discharged from hospital and who have loss of arm and hand function. To test LifeCIT the investigators will randomly allocate patients to receive either the LifeCIT intervention or usual care. A researcher, who doesn't know which group patients have been allocated to, will measure their arm and hand function, record the problems this causes and how it affects their quality of life. Tests will be repeated after treatment (3 weeks) and 6 months later. The investigators will also examine the cost-effectiveness of treatment and ask both therapists and patients for their views."

NCT01282242,"This study was jointly developed and is jointly led by investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital and the intramural division of NINDS. We are doing this research study to find out if Activase ® (also called alteplase or rt-PA) can safely be given to people with an acute ischemic stroke when their stroke onset was not witnessed making them ineligible for standard thrombolytic (clot busting) therapy. We also want to find out if rt-PA can help people recover better from their stroke.

The purpose of this study is to: 1) see if it is safe to give intravenous (IV) rt-PA to people with unwitnessed stroke but with MRI evidence of early ischemic stroke, 2) see if rt-PA is effective if given to people who are selected for treatment based on MRI evidence of an early stroke, and 3) get information about this new MRI diagnostic methods for guiding stroke treatment."
NCT01322607,"Residual neurological deficits from stroke lead to gait inefficiencies, resulting in an extremely high energy cost of movement and contributing to overall disability and lower quality of life. Therefore, interventions targeting movement economy should be developed for those in the chronic phase of stroke recovery. This study is designed to compare the effect of two distinctly different exercise paradigms (a higher-intensity treadmill training program and a lower-intensity group exercise program) on economy of movement during over-ground walking and activities of daily living, as well as the extent to which gains in muscular strength, muscular endurance, and balance predict changes in movement economy."
NCT00111852,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate desmoteplase (which is a manufactured protein derived from the saliva of the vampire bat) in dissolving clots that are blocking the flow of blood through one (or more) of the blood vessels supplying the brain, thereby reopening the blocked blood vessel and allowing blood to flow again in individuals suffering from ischemic stroke."
NCT01327989,The objective of this study was to obtain prospective clinical data on the safety and efficacy of the Solitaire™ FR device for patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke.
NCT03696121,"Haemorrhagic stroke, an emergency caused by bleeding in the brain, often leads to death or long-term disability. A quarter of these patients are taking blood-thinning drugs (antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin) because they are at risk of a heart attack or ischaemic stroke. Patients taking these drugs are more likely to die or be disabled if they have a haemorrhagic stroke. At present, there is no effective treatment for reversing their effects. Desmopressin is a drug which may reverse the effects of antiplatelet drugs and stop bleeding. The investigators would like to run a large randomised trial to see if Desmopressin can reduce the number of people who die or are disabled after haemorrhagic stroke."

NCT01429350,The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Penumbra System as an adjunctive treatment to intravenous (IV) recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA)in patients with acute ischemic stroke from large vessel occlusion in the brain. IV rtPA is the only drug approved for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke but it does not work very well in cases where the stroke is caused by a large vessel occlusion. The hypothesis being tested is to determine if the addition of a treatment by a mechanical thrombectomy device like the Penumbra System can improve the clinical outcome of the patient over just using IV rtPA alone.
NCT01499173,Getting to the hospital quickly is the key to treating stroke. African Americans suffer more strokes with worse outcomes and receive stroke treatments less often than European Americans. This project will work to reduce these health disparities by creating and testing the feasibility of a peer-led faith-based behavioral intervention in an African American community with a goal to increase calls to 911 so stroke patients can be treated quickly.
NCT04797598,"Stroke is the third leading cause of functional disability and death in the world. It leads to many problems that affect gait, upper extremity function and balance. In stroke patients balance dysfunction leads to impaired postural control and walking. Because of poor balance fall rate increases in stroke patients. Balance is an important predictor of outcome in stroke rehabilitation. After stroke difficulties in balance control may be caused by multiple factors such as muscle weakness, impaired proprioception, and asymmetry in weight wearing, spasticity and impaired motor control. Different means are used to treat stroke, some conventional treatments along with new adjunct therapies are usual practice for the rehabilitation of the stroke.

Virtual Reality is choice of adjunct therapy now a days and can be used in different ways for the rehabilitation. Virtual Reality or active video gaming proved their role as vital part of the treatment program in pediatric rehabilitation as well as adult rehabilitation program. These programs help the patient to achieve goals for functional and activities of daily living skills."

NCT01502761,"Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability worldwide. This investigation will address the safety and feasibility of directed, intra-arterial Magnesium measurement and therapy, through endovascular access, in acute stroke patients. The proposal represents the first study to directly quantify levels of a systemically administered neuroprotectant in the region of cerebral ischemia. It also establishes a novel endovascular platform for direct delivery of neuroprotective agents to ischemic cerebral tissue distal to an occlusive thrombus. This research seeks to improve patient care by establishing a novel delivery mechanism for the rescue of threatened brain parenchyma that can be administered rapidly following acute stroke. If successful, this selective distribution will allow delivery to ""at risk"" tissue in a rapid manner. Salvage of viable, but threatened, penumbral tissue could afford stroke patients an increased probability of favorable long term outcome. The investigators hypothesize that endovascular, intra-arterial, Magnesium administration will deliver high concentration of this neuroprotective agent to otherwise inaccessible cerebral territories, while limiting systemic concentrations. The proposed investigation will evaluate the safety and feasibility of this novel treatment technique"
NCT05241782,"Heart rate variability (HRV) in post-stroke patients are closely related to patient mortality, neurological deterioration and overall prognosis. Anxiety and depression will demotivate the patients' will to undergo rehabilitation program, which would delay their functional recovery. The influence of acupressure over the auricle on the HRV, anxiousness and depressive mood have yet to be verified. The investigators aimed to study the effect on auricular acupressure treatment between the different trending of HRV, anxiety and depression and their correlations.

This is a randomized control study, consisted of 70 patients with post-stroke depressive mood, from both CGH and Xizhi Cathay hospital in Taiwan. HRV analysis is performed on the first 24 hours, and on a weekly basis for a total of 6 weeks. The included depressed patients were defined by the ""Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale"" and weekly will be undertaken by the patients. A ""Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire"" pre-test and after-test will be undertaken by the patients. Experimental group will receive acupressure treatment by the second week, trice daily, 3~5minutes each session for a course of four weeks. Data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0, using generalized estimating equation, GEE.

The study hypothesized that the auricular acupressure treatment would improve post-stroke depression. Therefore, participants would be more willing to receive rehabilitation program. Our study would also help to provide future references on related studies."
NCT01507688,"The experience of a stroke event may result in a disruption to the survivor's daily life. Patients with stroke have reported fears of permanent disability and major concerns over their ability to recover and be productive and engaged with family, friends and coworkers. To enhance recovery from stroke, the investigators designed a stroke self-management program and have pilot tested the program among Veterans recovering from stroke/TIA. The study is a three-site, randomized controlled trial designed to test the efficacy of a stroke self-management program. The intervention program includes 6 bi-weekly sessions over months 1-3 followed by monthly telephone calls as the investigators administered in the investigators' pilot study during months 4-6 for a total length of program duration of 6 months. The investigators have added 3 monthly group support sessions during months 4-6 for additional peer support. Thus, participants will receive bi-monthly support during months 4-6. The three intervention sites include the Jesse Brown VAMC in Chicago, the Roudebush VAMC in Indianapolis, and the IU Health Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana. The three hospitals represent facilities with a small, moderate, and large volume of acute stroke care, respectively. Additionally, Methodist Hospital includes a greater proportion of women which enables us to study the patterns and preferences of women with stroke/TIA and tailor the investigators' future programs to prepare for the increasing female Veteran population."
NCT01591005,"The aim of the project is to demonstrate a fibrinolytic effect of sonothrombolysis (continual transcranial Doppler monitoring) using 2 MegaHertz (MHz) diagnostic probe on the reduction of risk of brain infarctions due to the activation of endogenous fibrinolytic system during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid stenting (CS). 240 patients indicated for CEA (120 patients) and CS (120 patients) will be enrolled into the study in order to demonstrate a twenty-percent risk reduction of number and volume of brain infarctions detected using MRI examination 24 hours after CEA or CS in 5% level of significance. Patients will be randomized - subgroup 1 will undergo a 60minute non-diagnostic transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring during CEA or CS, subgroup 2 will undergo interventions without TCD monitoring. The second aim is to compare number of brain infarctions detected using MRI between CEA and CS patients.

Confirmation of the investigators hypothesis that sonothrombolysis is able to activate endogenous fibrinolytic system during CEA or CS with consecutive reduction of the number and volume of brain infarcts, can lead to the increase of the safety of CEA and CS in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis. The investigators can presume that up to 50% of patients indicated for CEA or CS can be treated using these methods in the future.

In the Substudy ""Risk of brain infarction after carotid endarterectomy and stenting"" the the risk of asymptomatic and symptomatic brain infarctions, changes in cognitive functions, as well as morbidity and mortality at 30 days between patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenoses undergoing elective CEA and CAS will be compared.

The sample size of the Substudy was based on an expected 80% difference of new ischemic lesions on DWI-MRI between CEA (estimated prevalence, 30%) and CAS (54%). Pre-study calculations showed that a minimum of 73 patients in each group was needed to reach a significant difference with an alpha value of 0.05 (two-tailed) and a beta value of 0.8 assuming that 15% of subjects would be lost to follow-up or refuse to participate in the study."

NCT01573169,"Patients with cerebral hemorrhage (ICH) have a high risk of venous thromboembolism. Intermittent pneumatic compression combined with elastic stockings have been shown to be superior to elastic stockings alone in reducing the rate of asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis after ICH in a randomized trial (4.7% vs. 15.9%). Graduated compression stockings alone are ineffective in preventing deep vein thrombosis in patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Less clear is the role of anticoagulation in the prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients with ICH because the use of anticoagulants may cause an enlargement of the hematoma. In a multicenter, randomized trial, the investigators will assess the efficacy and safety of enoxaparin in the prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. Enoxaparin (40 mg once daily) or standard therapy (graduated compression stockings and/or intermittent pneumatic compression and/or early mobilization) will be given subcutaneously for not less than 10 days beginning after 72 hours from stroke onset."
NCT01586975,The purpose of this study is to determine if PFA results correlate with ischemic event outcomes as well as bleeding complications. Hypothesis is antiplatelet agents will be more efficacious if they are administered in a dose-adjusted manner using PFA results as a guide.
NCT01569607,"Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity in the United States but identification of treatment strategies to improve outcome is limited by the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of recovery. Motor cortex (M1) reorganization plays a major-role in the recovery of motor deficits post-stroke; hence the importance for further development of rehabilitative strategies that utilize this potential for recovery.

In Specific Aim 1, investigators will determine if repeated exposure to training combined with Hebbian-type M1 stimulation enhances functional M1 reorganization in lesioned M1 of stroke patients.

In Specific Aim 2, investigators will determine if repeated exposure to training combined with Hebbian-type M1 stimulation enhances structural cortical reorganization in lesioned M1 of stroke patients and to explore whether these structural changes are related to the training induced functional cortical reorganization.

The overall goal of this project is to determine the effect of Hebbian- type stimulation on both, functional and structural brain reorganization, thereby obtaining indirect evidence for the neuronal substrate underlying training related improvement and maintenance of motor function in stroke patients. This knowledge may have a substantial positive impact on treatment for stroke patients that may significantly improve recovery and could move the field of neuro-rehabilitation forward."
NCT01585597,The purpose of this study is to determine whether reducing a patients body temperature (mild hypothermia of 33 degrees Centigrade) will significantly reduce the risk of brain injury (notably reperfusion injury and hemorrhagic conversion) in patients that have suffered a significant interruption of blood flow to an area of brain (occlusion of large proximal cerebral artery) and have undergone successful removal of that interruption (revascularization).
NCT05565976,"Background: Dementia is an international public health problem, affecting approximately 50,000,000 people worldwide in 2018 and will triple by 2050; furthermore, reaching an approximate cost of 4 billion dollars. Given its high worldwide prevalence and probable underdiagnosis, the international guidelines for the assessment of dementia syndromes recommend the assessment of cognitive impairment in patients over 55 years of age as part of clinical practice in patients who presented an ischemic cerebrovascular event. Several risk factors associated with cognitive impairment in cerebrovascular disease are identified in the literature: 1) demographic factors (e.g., age over 65 years and female sex); 2) risk factors present prior to the ischemic stroke (e.g., cognitive impairment, physical impairment); 3) factors utilized to assess the severity of an ischemic stroke (e.g., supratentorial location, ischemic stroke in the dominant hemisphere, recurrence of ischemic strokes); 4) post-ischemic stroke factors (e.g., delirium and seizures); and 5) factors associated with neuroimaging findings (e.g., cerebral small vessel disease, cortical atrophy, and medial temporal lobe atrophy).

This is a randomized controlled trial in individuals with an acute ischemic stroke without dementia that will be treated with 10mg dapagliflozin PO q24h for 12 months and standard treatment against only standard treatment (i.e., statins, platelet antiaggregant, and hypoglycemic medications) when appropriate. The outcome measure evaluated will be global cognitive function. Cardiovascular risk factors will be associated with cognitive decline."
NCT01591018,"The aim of the project is to demonstrate a fibrinolytic effect of sonothrombolysis (continual transcranial Doppler monitoring) using 2 MHz diagnostic probe on the reduction of risk of brain infarctions due to the activation of endogenous fibrinolytic system during cardiac surgery (CS). 120 patients indicated for CS (CABG or valve replacement) will be enrolled into the study in order to demonstrate a twenty-percent risk reduction of number and volume of brain infarctions detected using MRI examination 24 hours after CEA or CS in 5% level of significance. Patients will be randomized - subgroup 1 will undergo a 40-240minute non-diagnostic TCD monitoring during CS, subgroup 2 will undergo interventions without TCD monitoring.

The aim of the project is a concordance with the aim No 1 of the Resort Program of a Research and Development: ""Improvement of quality of life of patients using the modern therapeutic methods but with relative small positive effect of quality of life"". The aim of the project is in concordance with a priority of announced public grant competition: ""Development of the new therapeutic methods of cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary heart disease and stroke"". Confirmation of our hypothesis that sonothrombolysis is able to activate endogenous fibrinolytic system during CS with consecutive reduction of the number and volume of brain infarcts, can lead to the increase of the safety of CS in patients. We can presume that up to 50% of patients indicated for CS can be treated using these methods in the future."
NCT05565781,"Stroke recurrence largely depends on the detection of the cause and the control of vascular risk factors, with occult atrial fibrillation (AF) being one of the most important. Prolonged ambulatory cardiac monitoring is recommended for detecting occult AF. Currently, there are non-invasive monitoring devices such as the textile Holter that have proven to be useful for monitoring for up to 30 days but not longer. Another alternative is smartwatches, although they must be validated for use in the elderly population who have had a stroke."

NCT05565144,"Background: In stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), presence and high number of strictly lobar cerebral microbleeds (compatible with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, CAA) seems to be associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation, symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation, remote hemorrhage, and poor functional outcome. Some of these reported CAA patients with cerebral microbleeds also had chronic lobar intracerebral haemorrhage. Few data is available on IVT-treated CAA patients showing cortical superficial siderosis. There are no reports studying factors associated with brain hemorrhagic complication or functional outcome inside a group of IVT-treated CAA patients. Our aim was to evaluate brain hemorrhagic complications on 24h-CT and functional outcome after IVT in stroke patients with CAA features on pre-IVT MRI.

Methods: In our stroke center, IVT decision in patients with CAA MRI features is left at the discretion of the treating physician. We retrospectively screened pre-IVT imaging of 959 consecutive IVT-treated stroke patients (between January 2015 and July 2022) without ongoing anticoagulation therapy for probable CAA MRI features defined by modified Boston criteria. After exclusion of 119 patients with lacking MRI (n=47), with MRI showing motion artefacts (n=49) or with alternative chronic brain hemorrhage cause on MRI (n=23), 15 IVT-treated patients with probable CAA on pre-IVT MRI were identified. In these 15 patients, clinical, biological and MRI characteristics were compared between patients with vs. without post-IVT hemorrhage and between patients with poor (MRS 3-6) vs. good (MRS 0-2) functional outcome at discharge."

NCT03342534,"Neurological deficits and motor disorders are extremely common after stroke. Physical therapies can improve the autonomy of these patients, but despite an intensive stationary neurorehabilitation, severe deficits often persist. Complementary therapies that could improve recovery would therefore be very welcome.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) induces, in a non-invasive way, a transient inhibitory or excitatory neuromodulation of certain cerebral regions. An increasing number of studies show that this modulation of brain activity can improve motor functions in patients with brain lesions and increase the effect of physical therapies. However, the ""optimum"" configuration of tDCS and the induced effects remain to be characterized and investigated.

The investigators therefore propose to carry out a study including a pilot phase in order to determine the most efficient tDCS setup. The optimum setup of of the pilot phase will be compared to a placebo condition in a multicentric main study."
NCT03694028,"Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S. Individuals with hemiparesis due to stroke often have difficulty bearing weight on their legs and transferring weight from one leg to the other. The ability to bear weight on the legs is important during functional movements such as rising from a chair, standing and walking. Diminished weight transfer contributes to asymmetries during walking which commonly leads to greater energy expenditure. Moreover, deficits in bearing weight on the paretic leg contribute to lateral instability and are associated with decreased walking speed and increased risk of falling in individuals post-stroke. These functional limitations affect community participation and life quality. Thus, restoring the ability to bear weight on the legs, i.e., limb loading, is a critical goal for rehabilitation post-stroke. The purpose of this research is to identify the impairments in neuromechanical mechanisms of limb loading and determine whether limb loading responses can be retrained by induced forced limb loading."

NCT01613339,"Affected balance capacity is common after a stroke due to paresis and sensory disturbances. The affected balance capacity may cause walking disturbances, falls and decreased mobility. Balance may be improved by physical therapy. A possible method for balance training is body awareness therapy, that was introduced in Sweden by Jacques Dropsy and Gertrud Roxendal. Earlier body awareness therapy was mostly used in psychiatric care but in the recent years the method has been used for people with long-tern pain, amputations and multiple sclerosis. Body awareness therapy includes exercises in lying, sitting and standing. Focus of the exercises are awareness of one´s movement behaviour, breathing patterns, resources and limitations. Postural control is an essential part in the exercises. Body awareness therapy could be used for people with stroke as a way to improve postural control. The aim of this study is to investigate if balance training using body awareness therapy can improve balance and walking in people after stroke. The interventions consists of body awareness therapy once a week for 8 weeks."

NCT04866420,"Mental fatigue is a major problem for stroke survivors and sometimes remains present years after the event. It is often rated as the most persisting and frustrating symptom. For many, mental fatigue has a significant negative effect on rehabilitation, and patients report difficulties with returning to previous levels of participation in their meaningful everyday activities whether at home, work or in the community.

The development of effective evidence based interventions have been limited by our understanding of post stroke fatigue. This may be attributed to the fact that the underlying mechanisms for post stroke mental fatigue are unknown. Evolving theories suggest that mental fatigue may be associated with a dysfunction in the cognitive domain of attention.

An impairment in the domain of attention may result in previously effortless activities of daily living that require sustained attention to become exhausting. Specific knowledge on the influence of background noise and other distractions on a person's ability to sustain attention after stroke is lacking. This research project will contribute to new and important knowledge in this area.

A total of 30 adults will be reviewed at least 2 months after stroke on tasks that require sustained attention. The investigators plan to observe the influence background distraction has on the ability to do these tasks and whether wearing earphones will assist with concentration levels, and reduce fatiguing situations.

This project provides a unique opportunity to investigate how a dysfunction in the cognitive domain of attention may be related to the experience of mental fatigue after stroke. The investigators will use a reaction time based test, fatigue questionnaires, alongside the wearing of earphones when examining associations. This knowledge may help to determine who is at risk of developing symptoms of mental fatigue. Furthermore, it may shed a light on possible prevention strategies, and provide more suitable guidance to those affected by mental fatigue."

Sixty percent of these older adults (> 65 years) will return to their homes after a stroke and will require ongoing rehabilitation. About 92% of older adults have two or more chronic conditions. These patients often require services from a number of providers in a number of settings and are therefore, susceptible to fragmented health care when transitioning from hospital to home. New interventions are needed to improve the quality of care as patients move from hospital to home after a stroke. The proposed research project will examine the impact of a new intervention on patient/caregiver health, patient/caregiver and provider experience and costs, compared to usual health care services. The new intervention will be coordinated by a system navigator and consists of four core components: 1) development of a comprehensive discharge plan, 2) up to 6 home visits (supported by phone calls) by an interprofessional outpatient team, 3) monthly case conferences including the interprofessional care team who will discuss and focus on the patient's goals and care needs, and 4) linkages to other healthcare and community services.

NCT03484182,"This is an online study that involves assessment and training of arm function at home. Stroke is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Of the annual incidence of stroke (~750,000) in the USA about 60% fail to recover arm and hand use contributing to reduced quality of life for survivors and caregivers. How can therapists facilitate the rehabilitation of individuals with arm movement deficits and increase their quality of life over a long time period? It is known that principles of treatment including repetition, feedback, challenge and progression are important for producing recovery. The ability for patients to train at home and manage their own rehabilitation duration, intensity and progression, via effective self-management strategies, is vital. What is needed is an effective, easy to use, low cost system that self-motivates patients to intensively practice their therapy exercises at home while maintaining elements of repetition, feedback, challenge and progression. In this proposal the investigators intend to adapt just such a ""web-based system"" originally designed in the UK. The first version of the system has shown preliminary efficacy and feasibility in a small pilot study in UK. The investigators will adapt the system for use in the USA, with the assistance of consultants from the UK.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and feasibility of using a free, easy to use, interactive web-based upper extremity stroke rehab program on individuals with stroke who have been discharged from outpatient rehabilitation. The goal is to compare the home use of the web-based stroke rehab program with that of written exercises in a randomized controlled trial. The aims/objectives are to (1) adapt the existing system for use in America including adding bilateral activities and then to assess (2) motor function immediately before and after six weeks intervention and after 12 weeks follow up in order to support the efficacy of using this web-based intervention; (3) behavioral changes in motivation and self-efficacy at the same time points to understand the relationship between behavioral and motor function changes; (4) perceptions of patients and caregivers of the web-based program to understand feasibility and barriers to home use; and (5) perceptions of therapists to understand feasibility and barriers to clinic use."

NCT02798770,"Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of acquired disability among adults, and one of the main causes of death. In Switzerland, the approved time window for stroke treatment with intravenous thrombolysis after symptom onset is 4.5 h. Even within the 4.5 h time-window, however, the benefit of treatment strongly decreases as time passes.

Moreover, only around 10% patients receive thrombolytic treatment, since patients with stroke arrive too late to the hospital (prehospital delay). Despite efforts to educate the community on the symptom of stroke, prehospital delay did not decrease over time, and the reasons remain incompletely understood. Prehospital delay reduces the proportion of patients with ischemic stroke treated with thrombolysis, and reduces the odds of favorable outcome among the minority treated with thrombolysis.

This prospective cohort study aims at understanding the causes of prehospital delay among patients with acute ischemic stroke. Trained study-nurses will interview, at the bedside, patients and proxies along a standardized questionnaire on prehospital delay. Avoiding modificables causes of prehospital delay may increase the thrombolysis rate and improve outcomes after stroke."

NCT01922986,"When a certain area of the brain is injured, like in stroke, several events occur. One side of the body may become weak. This weakness is called hemiparesis and it may create difficulty in performing tasks like writing, eating, and walking. The weakness results from two sources:

death of some brain cells in the affected side (hemisphere) of the brain
exaggerated inhibitory signals from the unaffected hemisphere acting on surviving neurons in the affected hemisphere.

Investigators cannot change neurons that have died but they may be able to change the exaggerated inhibition that impairs the surviving neurons in the affected hemisphere.The purpose of this study is to try to decrease the exaggerated inhibition coming from the unaffected hemisphere, which suppresses the affected hemisphere, with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Investigators hypothesize that, from admission to discharge, active rTMS combined with conventional therapy will produce greater functional gains in the paretic hand compared to sham rTMS combined with conventional therapy, as measured by standard tests."
NCT01907321,"Stroke is the leading case of neurologic swallow dysfunction, or dysphagia. Post stroke dysphagia is associated with approximately 50% increase in the rate of pneumonia diagnoses; aspiration pneumonia is the most common respiratory complication in all stroke deaths, accounting for a three-fold increase in the 30-day post stroke death rate. The long-term goal of this systematic line of research is to decrease the morbidity, mortality, and health care costs associated with disordered airway protection following stroke.

The overall hypothesis central to this proposal is that the ability to protect the airway is dependent upon a continuum of multiple behaviors, including swallowing and cough. Safe, efficient swallowing prevents material from entering the larynx and lower airway, and effective cough ejects aspirate or mucus material. Currently, only one end of the continuum, swallowing, is rigorously assessed in stroke patients. However, ineffective or disordered cough is indicative of the inability to eject aspirate material or clear mucus and secretions from the lower airway. Ineffective clearance and subsequent accumulation of material in the lower airway increases the risk of chest infection. Hence, patients at the greatest risk for chest infection would not only have disordered swallowing (dysphagia) but also disordered cough (dystussia), meaning they are more likely to aspirate material and then cannot effectively eject the aspirate from the airway. There is a high likelihood that swallowing and cough are simultaneously disordered following stroke. To date, there is a treatment that targets both swallowing and cough function in stroke patients.

Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) increases expiratory muscle strength (Baker et al., 2005) and there is evidence that supports its use to improve both swallow and cough functions in patients with Parkinson's disease (Troche et al., in press). This cross-system, device-driven approach to rehabilitating multiple contributors to airway protection deficits is highly desirable in the stroke population due to the likelihood of the co-occurrence of both swallow and cough disorders. To date, EMST has not been tested in stroke patients. We propose that by including cough in the screening, evaluation and treatment processes for disorders of airway protection, we will be able to better identify and treat patients most at risk for airway compromise and associated sequelae."

NCT02389608,"Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is currently considered a beneficial method for patients with neurological problems due to the modulation of cortex activity as well as the enhancement and prolongation of functional gains achieved during physical therapy. Purpose: The aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the immediate effects of a session of tDCS over the primary motor cortex combined with functional electrical simulation (FES) on electrical activity of the tibialis anterior muscle, balance and distribution of plantar pressure in individuals with hemiparesis stemming from a stroke. A further aim is to determine whether the effects of the combination of both stimulation methods are better than those achieved when each method is employed alone. Methods/design: A randomized, double-blind, crossover, cross-sectional study will be conducted involving 30 stroke survivors with hemiparesis who meet the eligibility criteria. Evaluations will involve an identification and screening chart, the classification of motor impairment using the Fugl-Meyer Scale, the determination of spasticity of the triceps surae muscle (modified Ashworth scale), electromyography of the tibialis anterior muscle, static balance and cognitive dual-task balance (stabilometry) and plantar pressure. After the initial evaluations, the participants will undergo four interventions: 1) anodal tDCS + placebo FES + active tibialis anterior contraction; 2) placebo tDCS + active FES + active tibialis anterior contraction; 3) anodal tDCS + active FES + active tibialis anterior contraction; and 4) placebo tDCS + placebo FES placebo + active tibialis anterior contraction. tDCS will be administered over the primary motor cortex and FES will be administered over the tibialis anterior muscle. The order of the different protocols will be randomized and both the evaluator and patients will be blinded to which protocol is being administered."
NCT02042534,"Rationale Acute ischemic stroke due to atrial fibrillation (AF) carries a high risk for early recurrence. In acute stage, guidelines recommend aspirin, but do not recommend anticoagulation due to the increased risk of intracranial bleeding. Since, aspirin has a limited efficacy of preventing recurrent stroke in AF, expert consensus suggests early anticoagulation in non-severe stroke with AF. The current practice for acute ischemic stroke patients with AF is delayed warfarin administration with aspirin use for non-minor stroke or immediate warfarin administration (sometimes with heparin bridging) for minor stroke. However, conventional anticoagulation with warfarin in acute ischemic stroke with AF has the following limitations: 1) risk of intracranial bleeding particularly in acute stage, 2) delayed action and transient paradoxical thrombogenic tendency due to the inhibition of protein C, resulting in the risk of early recurrent embolic stroke, and 3) prolongation of hospitalization waiting for full anticoagulation. In contrast, as compared to warfarin, rivaroxaban is advantageous for reduced risk of intracranial bleeding and immediate anticoagulation efficacy.

Goal The current trial will examine whether early initiation (within 5 days from stroke onset) of rivaroxaban as compared to conventional warfarin would reduce intracranial bleeding, recurrent embolic stroke, and hospital stay in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to AF."

NCT00124826,"High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) affects 40% of acute stroke patients and has a major adverse effect on survival and recovery. Increased production of lactic acid in brain tissue that has a poor blood supply is postulated to be the mechanism by which high blood sugar may worsen brain injury after stroke. Treatment with insulin infusions is proposed as a neuroprotective strategy, and a clinical trial is ongoing to test this hypothesis. However, the biological basis for insulin treatment has not been established, and there is uncertainty about the duration of insulin infusion that may be required to limit damage.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a brain scanning technique that allows measurement of brain lactic acid. When performed in conjunction with conventional MRI scanning, the relationship of lactate accumulation to stroke expansion can be established. SELESTIAL is a randomised, placebo-controlled trial of insulin infusions of 24 or 72 hours (h) duration in acute stroke patients with hyperglycaemia, to establish whether insulin prevents lactate accumulation over the initial 72h after stroke, how this relates to stroke evolution, and the effect of treatment on stroke size and clinical outcomes at 1 week."

NCT02185404,"The objective of this research is to test a passive shoe to correct gait in individuals with asymmetric walking patterns. This will be done in a clinic. Individuals with central nervous system damage, such as stroke, often have irregular walking patterns and have difficulty walking correctly. Recent research has shown that using a split-belt treadmill can create after-effects that temporarily correct the inefficient walking patterns. However, the corrected walking pattern does not efficiently transfer from the treadmill to walking over ground. The iStride, formerly known as the Gait Enhancing Mobile Shoe (GEMS), may allow a patient to practice walking in many different locations, such as their own home, which we hypothesize will result in a more permanent transfer of learned gait patterns. To enable long-term use, our proposed shoe design is passive and uses the wearer's natural forces exerted while walking to generate the necessary motions."

NCT02360488,"The current study will test the effectiveness of a novel home-based telehealth system designed to improve motor recovery and patient education after stroke. A total of 124 subjects (the number may be larger depending on the rate of subject dropout) with arm motor deficits 4-36 weeks after a stroke due to ischemia or to intracerebral hemorrhage will be randomized to receive 6 weeks of intensive arm motor therapy (a) in a traditional in-clinic setting or (b) via in-home telerehabilitation (rehabilitation services delivered to the subject's home via an internet-connected computer). The intensity, duration, and frequency of this therapy will be identical across the two groups, with subjects in both treatment arms receiving 36 sessions (18 supervised and 18 unsupervised), 80 minutes each (including a 10 minute break), over 6 weeks. The primary endpoint is within-subject change in the arm motor Fugl-Meyer (FM) score from the Baseline Visit to 30 Day Follow-Up Visit. Arm motor status is the focus here because it is commonly affected by stroke, is of central importance to many human functions, and is strongly linked to disability and well being after stroke."

NCT02326428,"Ischemic stroke, i.e. irreversible damage of a part of the patient's brain, is caused by the formation of blood clot in the major vessel which gives blood supply to a certain part of the brain. At early time, within the first 4,5 hours, the conventional treatment is to try to dissolve this blood clot with a medication (""thrombolytic drug"") which is administered to the blood through the needle in the vein. If the clot still remains there, additional treatment is possible - going directly to the clot via artery and taking it out with a special device. Patients may be included even if they are not treated with intravenous thrombolysis because of contraindication or other reasons. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the benefit and safety efficacy of thrombectomy and standard stroke care in clinical routine treatment of acute occlusive stroke compared to standard stroke care only."
NCT05311384,"CI therapy is a family of techniques that has systematically applied intensive treatment daily over consecutive days, supervised motor training using a technique called shaping, behavioral strategies to improve the use of the more- affected limb in real life situations called a Transfer Package (TP), and strategies to remind participants to use the more-affected extremity; including restraint of the less-affected arm in the upper extremity (UE) protocol. Numerous studies examining use of CI therapy with UE rehabilitation have demonstrated robust evidence for increasing the amount and the quality of the paretic UE functional use in daily situations of individuals recovering from stroke.

Previous studies have explored the barriers for clinical implementation of the approach, including the amount of time needed by therapists, other resources required and lack of payment for the services. With regards to therapists' time/resources, in the signature CI therapy protocol, therapists supervised movement training for 3 hours daily (except for weekends) for a 12 consecutive-day period. This level of supervision in highly unusual for traditional rehabilitation clinical settings. The treatment schedule is also incompatible with most insurance reimbursement policies in the US. As such, most CI therapy clinics require patients to pay privately with little or no insurance reimbursement. Such practices severely limit the number of patients who can afford to receive CI therapy. Two lines of evidence have suggested that an alternative CI therapy protocol may allow for the essential (or ""Key"") CI therapy elements to be delivered in a schedule that better utilizes therapist time/resources and is compatible with payment policies of many US insurance companies. One line of evidence comes from findings that indicate that the original 6-hour supervised training schedule could be shortened to as little as 2-hours/daily without a reduction in outcomes. Additional evidence comes from a study exploring the systematic addition and deletion of the signature CI therapy protocol elements indicated that when the transfer package was omitted, outcomes related to functional use were reduced by 50%. These findings were also verified by brain imaging studies conducted concurrently that revealed a much-reduced level of brain remodeling in those not receiving the transfer package. These findings highlight the potential effectiveness of the transfer package and continued movement training by the patient while away from clinical supervision. The hypothesis of this study is that the amount of supervised training could be reduced further and delivered in a distributed schedule (1 to 4 times/ week over an 8-week period) instead of consecutively over a 12-day treatment period. This modification could be possible by adapting and strengthening the transfer package component of the protocol. In order to investigate if all of the Keys intervention protocol is necessary for producing optimal outcomes, the delivery of specific protocol elements will be also explored. Additionally, another round of testing at the 4-week point of the 8-week intervention will be administered to investigate the need for the final 4 weeks of the intervention."

NCT02157532,"Stroke constitutes the primary cause of acquired disability in adults and the second cause of dementia following Alzheimer disease. It has been shown that patients with a moderate to severe clinical score have occlusion of brain large vessels, resulting in a worse clinical outcome. Many studies have demonstrated that early recanalization after IV rtPA is more restricted, the larger and more proximal the artery. Several systems for mechanical intracranial arterial thrombectomy of large trunks have recently been proposed and are now available. Potential advantages of these mechanical systems on chemical thrombolysis are speed (a few minutes versus 1 hour) and absence of thrombolytic injection.

The objective of the EASI trial is thus to:

To validate intra-arterial thrombectomy use during the acute phase of cerebral stroke in patients treated with IV thrombolysis or in patients for whom thrombolysis is contra-indicated.
To determine whether a combined approach, standard treatment plus thrombectomy, is superior to standard treatment alone within 5 h of the appearance of symptoms, in patients with occlusion of proximal cerebral arteries following moderate to severe stroke (NIHSS larger than or equal to 8), evaluated at 3 months.

The design is a randomized, controlled multicentric trial, with a parallel comparison between standard and combined (standard plus thrombectomy) treatment.

480 patients fulfilling eligibility criteria will be sufficient to demonstrate the primary hypothesis of a 15% difference in number of subjects with a favorable mRS (less than or equal to 2) at 3 months, with the assumption of a 25% efficacy for IV thrombolytic treatment at 3 months.

IV thrombolysis is carried out according to standard practice. Mechanical thrombectomy is carried out with already approved devices, according to the manufacturer's instructions, following a diagnostic cerebral angiography.

The primary efficacy endpoint is clinical: favorable mRS (less than or equal to 2) at 3 months.

The primary safety endpoint is rate of death at 3 months and rate of symptomatic hemorrhage at 24 hours.

NCT01763320,"Patients with symptomatic stenosis of intradural arteries are at high risk for subsequent stroke. Since the SAMMPRIS trial, stenting is no longer recommended as primary treatment, however, the results of this trial, its inclusion criteria and its center selection received significant criticism and did not appear to reflect our experience, neither regarding natural history, nor treatment complications rate. As ICAS is the most common cause for stroke in Asian countries, we are hereby proposing a refined prospective randomized multicenter study in an Asian population with strictly defined patient and participating center inclusion criteria.

The China Angioplasty & Stenting for Symptomatic Intracranial Severe Stenosis (CASSISS) trial, is an ongoing, government-funded, prospective, multicenter randomized trial. It recruits patients with recent TIA or stroke caused by 70-99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery. Patients with previous stroke related to perforator ischemia will not be included. Only high-volume center with a proven track record will enroll patients as determined by a lead-in phase. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to best medical therapy alone or medical therapy plus stenting. Primary endpoints are any stroke or death within 30 days after enrollment or after any revascularization procedure of the qualifying lesion during follow-up, or stroke in the territory of the symptomatic intracranial artery beyond 30 days The CASSISS trial will be conducted in 8 sites in China with core imaging lab review at a North American site and aims to have a sample size of 380 subjects (stenting, 190; medical therapy, 190). Recruitment is expected to be finished by Dec, 2016. Patients will be followed for at least three years. The trial is scheduled to complete in 2019. In the proposed trial, certain shortcomings of SAMMPRIS including patient and participating center selection will be addressed. The present manuscript outlines the rationale and design of the study. We estimate that this trial will allow for a critical reappraisal of the role of intracranial stenting for selected patients in high volume centers."
NCT05588947,"Take Charge is a novel, community-based treatment for stroke developed to harness a person's self-determination. Two prior clinical trials with 572 stroke survivors showed that Take Charge improves quality of life, independence, and social participation up to a year after stroke. Take Charge has also been shown to be overall cost-saving to the health system and is a useful adjunct to standard care after stroke.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of healthcare has moved into a telehealth approach.

is delivering Take Charge by telehealth feasible?
is Take Charge by telehealth acceptable to this population?

Participants will meet with facilitators online via Zoom at 4 to 16 weeks after stroke, and be randomized to receive either:

two Tele-Take Charge sessions six weeks apart
one control tele-education session.

NCT05315726,"Several studies have recently tested the use of muscle vibration for the rehabilitation of patients after a stroke. When applied in a repeated and focused manner, this vibration appears to promote the recovery of functional capacities through the mechanisms of neuromuscular plasticity. These results are encouraging, showing in particular a significant decrease in spasticity in post-stroke patients in the chronic phase (> 6 months after stroke), on the upper and/or lower limbs. However, very few studies have been done on this type of early intervention. Muscle vibration may therefore be an innovative therapy to complement the care that is currently offered in the acute and subacute phase of post-stroke rehabilitation.

Moreover, brain plasticity after a stroke is particularly high in the 3 months after the accident, but the vast majority of studies having evaluated the impact of vibration in a chronic phase (> 12 months post-stroke). It is likely, however, that the influence of vibration, particularly on brain plasticity, is increased in the acute or subacute phase (first 6 months). To date, the effect of vibration on spinal cord or cortical plasticity has not been quantified in the acute or subacute phase. This is why the second part of this project (phase 2) aims to systematically evaluate and quantify the neuroplastic and functional effects of post-stroke vibration in the early phase.

NCT05299853,"Stroke is the leading neurological disease in the world that causes long-term disability. The most common cause of disability after stroke is motor impairment resulting from brain damage which ultimately cause respiratory and functional limitation. Respiratory muscle weakness including the diaphragm leads to biomechanical change in respiration which can reduce vital capacity and total lung capacity of stroke patients. The weakness of diaphragm and abdominal muscle also leads to decrease in maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) in stroke patients.

Respiratory muscle training such as inspiratory or expiratory muscle training is commonly used to improve the respiratory muscle strength and function in stroke. However, it was reported that respiration is closely related to upper limb function because the muscle of upper extremities surrounds the dorsal muscle of trunk and in order to breath, the movement of trunk is necessary, which in turn is related to the movement of the upper limbs."

NCT04169594,"Gait analysis is commonly performed in clinical practice. However, it is complex and requires an understanding of the activation of muscles in lower limbs, trunk, and upper limbs in a specific spatiotemporal pattern and the appropriate joint positions which support and advance the body weight in different phases of gait cycles.

In study, we plan to pilot the application of 3D gait analysis with statistical modelling in 2 common causes of gait deviation: unilateral hemiplegic stroke and unilateral lower limb amputation."
NCT05128370,"For several years now, it has been demonstrated that the upper limb plays an important role in the function of an efficient and balanced gait pattern in healthy adults. After a stroke, the reduced muscle strength has a clear influence on the gait pattern, but also on the active movement possibilities of the upper limb. However, the role of the upper limb during gait is not sufficiently explored in the literature. The gold standard for motion analysis is a 3D analysis performed with infrared cameras capturing reflective markers during gait. Unfortunately, it is not possible for all people after a stroke to undergo this examination. On the one hand, patients must already have a certain degree of independence with regard to gait. On the other hand, not all centers have access to this expensive accommodation. There are some validated observation scales for people after stroke to describe the gait based on a 2D video image. This method is much more accessible and can be applied by any therapist. However, to date there has been little attention paid to the upper limb in these observation scales. Therefore, analogous to the observation scales for gait, an observation scale for the upper limb during gait was set up. The use of this scale can add value to the rehabilitation of people after a stroke.

The treatment team will receive information about the patient's complete movement pattern.
The arm will be more prominent when setting rehabilitation goals related to gait. This can lead to a positive effect on the gait pattern itself, but also to more attention being paid to the arm, which has a more difficult recovery than the leg after a stroke.

The aim of the current study will be

to determine the inter and intra tester reliability of this visual observation scale
to investigate if the results of the visual observation scale correlate to a 3D assessment performed in a subgroup of participants"

NCT05491109,"Stroke is closely associated with high mortality among patients in hospitals and immobility leading development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) leading to pulmonary embolism (PE) and Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and/or ankle joint contracture, which impairs mobility resulting in bedridden. Worldwide, the incidences of DVTs is 0.75-2.69 per 1000 individuals and 2-7 per 1000 for individuals aged > 70 years and accounts for 600,000-800,000 deaths yearly.

Pharmacological treatment for DVTs include anti-coagulants to prevent blood clot development and VTE but may cause haemorrhagic stroke leading to death. Non-invasive treatment such as intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) and anti-embolism stockings may prevent DVT but not ankle joint contractures, which affects 50% of all stroke patients. Joint contractures exacerbate pedal edema and fluid retention, hamper proper joint movement and decreases ADLs and quality of life. Regular physiotherapy is vital for preventing ankle joint contracture and DVT but is labour intensive hence posing an increased workload on physiotherapists resulting in decreased physiotherapy duration.

This study will investigate the use of an automated robot-assisted ankle exercise solution (Venous Assistance and Contracture Management System, VACOM) to mimic therapist-assisted on bed passive ankle exercises to preclude the development of ankle joint contracture and facilitate venous flow in lower extremities to reduce DVT risk. The investigators hypothesize that the Venous Assistance and Contracture Management (VACOM) system can prevent ankle contracture, improve ankle range of motion (ROM) and flexibility while reducing the risk of DVT incidence among stroke patients more than using IPC alone. Additionally, through early ankle mobilization, rehabilitation can be optimized to achieve better neurological recovery."

NCT05225961,"Patients with tandem lesions (TL) are defined as patients with an acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with occlusion of an intracranial vessel of the anterior circulation and an occlusion or severe stenosis (70-99%) of the origin of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA). The greatest current limitation in the management of this type of lesion is the use of antithrombotic medication (double antiaggregation) in the acute phase that is required in case of placing extracranial stent to stabilize the atheroma plaque. In relation to this antiplatelet regimen, the latest clinical practice guidelines warn about the risk of combining intravenous fibrinolysis with antiplatelet medication in the acute phase, since it seems to increase the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). However, the non-stabilization of the carotid atheroma plaque is associated with higher rates of cervical reocclusion, poorer functional prognosis, and higher mortality.

Therefore, the use of a single antiplatelet agent could be a reasonable alternative. To establish the best protocol for mono-antiaggregant therapy in the acute phase of TL, the investigators propose to carry out a prospective multicenter randomized clinical trial.

All patients with ischemic stroke secondary to TL in the anterior circulation candidates for mechanical thrombectomy in whom cervical endoprosthesis will be placed in the acute phase, will be included, randomized to two groups: 500 mg of intravenous (iv) Aspirin vs Low dose regimen of Tirofiban iv.
Carotid reocclusion rates and sICH rates will be evaluated within the first 24 hours after mechanical thrombectomy . As a secondary objective, the functional prognosis at 3 months in both groups will be analyzed, as well as a panel of biomarkers predictors of reocclusion in both groups. Establishing an antiplatelet management protocol in the acute phase in these patients would be an innovative strategy not developed by any other group worldwide, and would place us at the forefront of research in the field. Likewise, developing a clinical-biological predictive model of carotid reocclusion will allow us to establish risk patients in which to plan alternative treatments. Reference hospitals in the treatment of ischemic stroke at the national level with sufficient experience in the management of this pathology will participate in the project."
NCT05449301,"According to the definition proposed by the World Health Organization, ""stroke is rapidly developing clinical signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function, with symptoms lasting 24 hours or longer, or leading to death, with no apparent cause other than of vascular origin"". Difficulty in walking is present in approximately 80% of stroke survivors. 25% of stroke survivors even after getting rehabilitation have residual gait impairments requiring full assistance after hospital discharge resulting in difficulties in performing basic activities of daily life.

Approaches to gait rehabilitation are different based on different models of motor physiology and disease recovery, but most of the approaches are targeting motor impairments during straight walking only as opposed to adaptive walking ability . In order to decrease health care burden effective rehabilitation and prevention is necessary. Multidisciplinary care dedicated for stroke leads to higher independence rates.

Conventional gait training regimes including linear parallel bar based gait training and treadmill based gait training protocols do not usually target the angular or rotational component of locomotion.

Current study will focus on Unilateral Step Training using a custom designed treadmill i.e. Rotational Split Belt treadmill (RSBT). This would provide a targeted gait training tool to reduce the risk of fall, improve gait and turning ability and functional activity eventually resulting in greater community participation and involvement in occupational activities. Such an approach could be effective in providing an early targeted and intense training environment similar to task-specific training in contrast to conventional method."
NCT05447754,"In the literature, it has been observed that traditional balance training (TBT) and robot-assisted walking training (RAGT) in stroke patients stimulate the balance mechanism by supporting the spinal muscles symmetrically and functionally. However, it is seen that there is no clear protocol for RAGT in the chronic period. Combined RAGT and TBT approaches over ten weeks have been shown to be more effective than TBT alone for the acute and subacute period. However, there is no definite expression for chronic period effects. No study was found in the literature in which an objective measuring device was used for balance assessment of patients receiving TBT and RAGT. If changes are detected between the two treatment groups in balance education in stroke patients as a result of objective evaluation, our study will lead to the necessity of including these changes in the treatment. Considering the effect of balance on activities of daily living, we believe that objective evaluation of the changes in balance after TBT and RAGT in stroke patients and shaping the treatment according to the evaluation results will contribute to the literature."

NCT05443633,"Aphasia is an acquired impairment of language, that commonly results from damage to language areas in the brain (typically the left side of the brain). This impairment is seen in many aspects of language, including understanding, speaking, reading and writing. It is estimated that about 2 million individuals are currently living with aphasia in the United States. Further, about 200,000 Americans acquire aphasia every year (National Aphasia Association, 2020). Aphasia poses significant impact on the affected individuals and their families. Behavioral treatments that target language deficits have been shown to enhance overall communication skills and life satisfaction among individuals with aphasia. Although there is evidence that suggests that treatment is efficacious for individuals with aphasia, the extent of improvement long-term coupled with the neural patterns among those individuals are largely unknown. The current study aims to investigate the efficacy of language-based treatment and its corresponding neural patterns."

NCT02795481,"Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the UK and currently costs the country £7bn per year. There is an overwhelming need to accurately and rapidly triage patients to allow best use of finite NHS specialist resources for the treatment of stroke.

A simple blood test of substances (the purines) that result from cellular metabolism and are produced in excess when brain cells are starved of oxygen and glucose (as occurs during a stroke) is proposed. The sensors designed by the investigators are used to measure blood purines during a procedure in which blood flow to the brain is reduced to allow surgical interventions on the major arteries that supply the brain. Previous studies by the investigators have shown that as soon as blood flow to the brain is reduced, purines are produced within minutes and are detectable in systemic arterial blood.

The current project will now compare the levels of purines in the blood of stroke patients and controls. The purines will be measured on admission to hospital and 24 hours later. The occurrence and magnitude of a stroke will be determined by an MRI scan given between 24 and 72hrs after admission. This study will establish whether purines are elevated in the blood of stroke patients on admission to hospital compared to healthy controls, and whether this correlates with the size of the stroke and damage to the brain."

NCT04040101,"Background:

Stroke is the 4th deadly disease in Taiwan, 2016. Long term disabilities, balance impairments and limitations of activities of daily living are common characteristics of stroke. Balance assessment and training play an important role in stroke rehabilitation. However, there are some limitations. Clinical assessments (functional scales) could not avoid some errors caused by subjective observations from different test givers; instrumental assessments (force plates, Biodex system) are complex to approach, not easy to use, and difficult to get. Balance training could not meet the expected effectiveness due to inconvenient transportations, forgotten home programs, and time limitation caused by huge amount of patients with insufficient therapists. Smartphones had been used for health promoting and sport training. The balance training related applications could be found at Google Play store, but clinically proved effective App and stroke-designed App has not yet existed. The balance rehabilitation of stroke sufferers will be benefited if there is an easy-use and effective App that supports balance assessment and personalized training by combining the convenience and powerfulness of smartphones.

Purpose:

The purposes of this study are: Year 1 Develop a smartphone-based application to assess and train static balance for stroke sufferers, and evaluate the feasibility of the application; Year 2 Develop a smartphone-based application to assess and train dynamic balance for stroke sufferers, and evaluate the feasibility of the application; Year 3 Build a static and dynamic balance performance standard by recruiting healthy subjects, then evaluate the training effects of the application on balance performance of stroke sufferers.

Methods:

Android smartphones will be used to analyze the balance performance by collecting acceleration and angular velocity data from the built-in sensors. Static balance assessment and training system will be developed in the first year. The system will assess balance ability by testing the performance under different standing conditions, then provide a training plan according to the assessment result. Dynamic balance assessment and training system will be developed in the second year. The system will execute limits of stability test to assess dynamic balance, then provide a training plan according to the assessment result. Validity and reliability will be tested in the first and second year, by comparing the smartphone assessment result with Berg balance scale, force plate, and Biodex balance system. In the third year, we will recruit healthy subjects to create a balance performance standard, then recruit chronic stroke subjects to evaluate the training effect of the App by comparing with traditional rehabilitation therapy.

Expected Results & Contribution When the study is completed, several valuable contributions will be provided. These include (1) developing a smartphone application which can be used to assess and rehabilitate static and dynamic balance functions on stroke sufferers; (2) evaluating the feasibility and the training effects of the smartphone application, and providing evidence-based results for scientific paper publication; (3) clinically offering an easy-used and effective tool for clinicians and subjects with stroke to evaluate and improve balance performance."

NCT05348044,"The proposed pilot study will explore the feasibility and preliminary impacts of a 6-week at-home group delivered inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST) exercise intervention on resilience in young stroke survivors. Resilience Exercise Training (Res-ET) intervention on young stroke survivors will assess feasibility of Res-ET and preliminary changes in resilience on young stroke survivors using a quasi-experimental one-group pretest-posttest design within the RE-AIM framework. The connection between resilience and exercise has not been clearly identified in literature, and there is no literature supporting IMST on resilience in young stroke survivors. The Res-ET intervention in young stroke survivors may serve as a pragmatic and novel approach to increase resilience while also increasing physiological and psychosocial well-being of young stroke survivors.

Aim 1. Test the feasibility (recruitment, retention, participation, and acceptability) of Res-ET intervention in a sample of young stroke survivors having had a stroke between the age of 18 - 50, AND who experienced a stroke within the last 6 months to 55 years of age AND have been cleared by a physician to participate in IMST exercise.

Aim 2. Assess the efficacy potential of Res-ET intervention on resilience, and preliminary direction and magnitude of psychosocial and physiological outcomes in young stroke survivors pre/post Res-ET intervention. Psychosocial outcome measures consist of; positive affect, self-efficacy, meaning/purpose, physical function, fatigue, and social satisfaction. Physiological outcome measures consist of, pulmonary function, physical activity, biometrics, and daily movement.

Aim 3. Collect qualitative data to assess acceptability and usability of Res-ET. Data will be collected through interviews and questionnaires about Res-ET feasibility, perceived utility, and satisfaction of the intervention. Perceived changes to resilience, functional capacity/movement (ADL's), and well-being will be recorded, transcribed, and thematically coded"

NCT05330234,"Aims: Assess the usability of OnTrack Tools, a clinician facing interface to manage stroke survivors using the OnTrack rehabilitation system. Background: Arm disability is a common problem after stroke that can lead to loss of independence, it affects

~450,000 people in the UK. Repetitive activity is critical for recovery but research shows people can struggle with intensity and keeping track of progress. The OnTrack system being developed at Imperial College London is a potential solution to this problem. Intervention: The OnTrack system consists of two software applications, OnTrack App - used by patients, and OnTrack Tools - used by clinicians. OnTrack Tools pulls data generated by the OnTrack App and enables the monitoring of clients' arm activity, and management of goals and educational content. The software is used to inform selfmanagement coaching by helping therapists understand more about how and when patients use their affected arm between treatment sessions. Design and methods: This study will assess the usability of the OnTrack Tools component of the system. The study will recruit stroke therapists from Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust to provide feedback on the experience and usability of OnTrack Tools' graphical user interface (GUI). The study will be divided into three progressive cycles of testing, feedback and iteration. Each cycle will see participants individually completing specific tasks related to system navigation and the management of patients under simulation. Participants will complete outcome measures and take part in focus groups. Researchers will analyse and use the feedback to improve the GUI ready for the next testing cycle. Patient and public involvement: The project team includes a PPIE group of stroke survivors who oversee the project and help us with public facing documentation. They are members of the research team and are reimbursed for their time and travel, according to INVOLVE guidance.

NCT03811769,"Stroke represents the fourth leading cause of death in industrialized nations, after heart disease, cancer, and chronic lower respiratory disease. The overall burden of stroke will rise dramatically in the next 20 years due to an ageing population. Approximately one-quarter of the patients suffering a stroke die within one year after the initial event and stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability. Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to large vessel occlusion (LVO) is a potentially devastating event, with a poor prognosis in the absence of timely revascularization. Whether in patients with large anterior circulation stroke, direct mechanical intervention is equally effective, superior or inferior to bridging thrombolysis remains a matter of debate.

Thus, this procedure, is now the recommended standard of care for selective patients with LVO in the anterior circulation. When performed with newer generation devices (mainly stent retrievers), more stringent imaging selection criteria and more efficient workflow than in previous trials, significantly reduces disability rates after AIS caused by LVO in the anterior circulation.

The STAIR (Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable) meeting aims to advance acute stroke therapy development through collaboration between academia, industry, and regulatory institutions. In pursuit of this goal and building on the available level I evidence of benefit from endovascular therapy (EVT) in large vessel occlusion stroke, STAIR IX consensus recommendations were developed that outline priorities for future research in EVT."

NCT03985761,"This trial studies the impact of motivational strategies designed by the gaming industry on adherence to a home tele-rehabilitation program designed to improve hand function in persons with stroke. A growing literature suggests that the extended practice of challenging hand tasks can produce measurable changes in hand function in persons with stroke. Current health care delivery systems do not support this volume of directly supervised rehabilitation, making it necessary for patients to perform a substantial amount of activity at home, unsupervised. Unfortunately, adherence to unsupervised home exercise regimens is quite poor in this population. The investigator's goal is to assess the impact of several well-established game design strategies: 1) Scaffolded increases in game difficulty 2) In-game rewards 3) Quests with enhanced narrative. The investigator's will utilize these enhancements to study their impact on motivation to perform a tele-rehabilitation- based home exercise program, adherence to the program and changes in hand function. The proposed study will utilize a system of novel rehabilitation technologies designed to facilitate home exercise performance. Subjects will perform 3 simulated rehabilitation activities supported by a passive exoskeleton, an infrared camera and software that will allow subjects to exercise at home. The investigator's will investigate: 1) Differences in measures of motivation elicited by motivationally enhanced simulations and un-enhanced control versions.2) The impact of motivational enhancements on actual adherence to a tele-rehabilitation program in persons with stroke and 3) The impact of motivational enhancement on improvements in hand function achieved by these subjects. This proposal will address a critical gap in modern rehabilitation - adherence to autonomous rehabilitation programs. Patient participation in unsupervised rehabilitation is one of the assumptions underpinning our health care system. This said, no data collected to date supports that adherence is acceptable. The technology and methodology in this proposal are an important step towards leveraging extensive research and development done by the computer gaming industry into improved rehabilitation practice."

NCT02915185,"A substantial proportion of individuals are left with poor residual functioning of the affected arm after a stroke. This has a tremendous impact on the quality of life and the ability for stroke survivors to live independently. While exercise is considered essential to any rehabilitation program, its benefits are generally far from optimal because of the lack of proper dosing in terms of intensity. One way to tackle this problem is to develop better tools that could predict an individual's potential and then adjust the intensity of exercise accordingly. One such predicting tool exists and consists of using non-invasive brain stimulation such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), to assess the integrity of descending motor pathways originating from the brain. TMS consists of applying a magnetic wand near the scalp to stimulate brain cells without inducing pain or discomfort. One goal of the current proposal is to use TMS to test the integrity of the motor pathway in chronic stroke survivors. The level of responses to TMS will be used to classify participants in terms of potential for recovery and then, to determine the optimal level of exercise. The study will also examine the effect of another non-invasive brain stimulation technique called transcranial Direct-Current Stimulation-tDCS to determine whether it can enhance the response to strength training exercise in the affected arm. Half of the participants will be trained with the tDCS on, while the other half will be trained with the stimulator off. The training program will last 4 weeks; 3X/week. Both clinical and neurophysiological measures will be performed to determine the impact of the strength training intervention on participants. Overall, the proposed project is expected to have a positive and significant impact on stroke survivors' quality of life."

NCT02856035,"Stroke (795,000/year in the US and 30 million existing stroke survivors in the world) damages brain neural structures that control coordinated upper limb movement. To most effectively target the brain damage, interventions should be directed so as to restore brain control serving coordination of peripheral neuromuscular function. Currently, there is a lack of a transformative intervention strategy, and only limited efficacy is seen in response to neural rehabilitation that is only peripherally-directed (limbs e.g.) or only directed at the brain. This study will employ a novel neural feedback approach with a closed-loop, real-time paradigm to engage and retrain existing brain function after stroke. Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMIR) provides neural feedback with the advantage of precisely identifying the location of brain activity for multiple cognitive and emotional tasks. However, the rtfMRI is costly and precludes motor learning that requires sitting and engaging the upper limb in complex motor tasks during imaging acquisition. In contrast, real-time functional near-infrared spectroscopy (rtfNIRS), although not as spatially precise as rtfMRI, offers a low-cost, portable solution to provide brain neural feedback during motor learning. This proposal will utilize both technologies in a hybrid, sequential motor learning protocol. Moreover, the study protocol will also simultaneously involve both central effective signals (through neural feedback) and peripheral affective signals by employing neutrally-triggered functional electrical stimulation (FES)-assisted coordination practice, which produces peripherally-induced affective signals from muscle and joint receptors. This novel combination intervention protocol will engage the central nervous system, motor effective pathway training along with induction of affective signal production (FES-assisted practice), all of which will be implemented within the framework of evidence-based motor learning principles."

NCT03019744,Goal of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of Myoelectrically-controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation (MeCFES) for the rehabilitation of upper limb in post-stroke patients. MeCFES-assisted rehabilitation will be compared with usual care rehabilitation of upper limb. It is hypothesized that that applying MeCFES in rehabilitation to assist normal arm movements during rehabilitation of the upper limb in persons with stroke will improve the movement quality and success and thus induce recovery at the body functions level (impairment) and the activity level (disability) of the International Classification of Function (ICF) superior to that induced by usual care rehabilitation.
NCT02963376,"Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States and is the leading cause of long term disability. Distinct geographic disparities in stroke mortality, with highest rates in the southeast United States including Arkansas, are known as the ""stroke belt."" There the average stroke mortality is ≈20% to 40% higher than the rest of the nation. Stroke is the leading cause of serious long-term disability. Between 2012 and 2030, disability and medical costs related to stroke are projected to triple, from $71.6 billion to $184.1 billion, with the majority of the projected increase in costs arising from those 65 to 79 years of age.

There are two main forms of stroke, ischemic and hemorrhagic. An ischemic stroke occurs in 85% of cases and is caused by cerebral vessel occlusion, obstructing blood flow to a portion of the brain. Currently, the only approved therapies for acute ischemic stroke are IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a thrombolytic agent that clears the thrombus within the blood vessel, or intra-arterial catheter thrombectomy. Despite the availability of therapy, it reaches only approximately 7% of ischemic stroke victims in the United States5. Delay beyond the effective time window for therapy is a common reason for failure.

To reduce the devastating impact of stroke on individuals and society, the investigators continue to seek ways to improve functional recovery and limit ischemic damage in stroke patients. The potential neuroprotective agent, dodecafluoropentane emulsion (DDFPe) has recently shown strong positive effects in pre-clinical animal models of acute ischemic stroke6-11. Other perfluorocarbons have been tested in humans as potential neuroprotectants and blood substitutes yet none have been successful."
NCT01341574,"'Unilateral neglect' is a disorder that occurs regularly after stroke. It is caused by right- as well as left-sided brain lesions, but more often by right-sided lesions. Patients with this disorder neglect the contralesional side of space and/or their body. Their body axis is often shifted ipsilesionally. A specific disorder that can appear in neglect patients is 'contraversive pushing': a postural deviation to the neglected side because the patient pushes himself away from the ipsi- to the contralesional side.

One of the most promising neglect interventions is prism adaptation (PA): inducing an optical shift of the visual field by means of prism glasses. This results in a modulation of brain areas involved in neglect and in an improvement of the neglect symptoms and postural deviation.

Research questions:

Which period is best suited to maximize therapeutic effects? In this respect the effects of early and delayed PA will be compared, regarding neglect-, postural and cerebral measures.
Which factors lead to a less favorable treatment outcome or to therapy resistance for PA?
Will the impact of PA be larger if postural factors are taken into account in the prism therapy?"

NCT03772847,"Previous clinical studies have confirmed that revascularization or recanalization rate after intravenous thrombolysis is closely related to the formation of thrombus, which also results in poor neurological function after thrombolysis. Platelet activating factor (PAF) strong platelet aggregation may be involved in thrombosis. Formation process. The main components of Ginkgolide injection (Ginkgo) are ginkgolide, ginkgolides A, ginkgolides B and ginkgolides C. Ginkgo biloba lactone can antagonize PAF and has strong anti-platelet aggregation. . Therefore, it can be speculated that ginkgolides injection combined with alteplase intravenous thrombolysis may improve the recanalization rate after thrombolysis and reduce the reocclusion rate.

In addition, clinical studies have also found that ginkgolide injection has a good auxiliary effect on hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, which can regulate inflammatory factors such as IL-6, TNF-α and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients. Recovery of neurological function in patients. It is well known that TNF-α, IL-β, IL-1, IL-6, IFN-γ, etc. are all inflammatory factors associated with reperfusion injury. Therefore, we speculate that ginkgolides injection may also regulate inflammatory factors associated with reperfusion injury, such as IL-6, TNF-α, thereby reducing reperfusion injury, thereby improving patient prognosis.

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical efficacy of ginkgolides injection combined with alteplase in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, and to improve the prognosis of patients with thrombolysis."

Then, it can be hypothesized that therapies focused in strengthening the triceps surae also improves the patient gait. It has been shown that Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) can improve triceps surae activation when applied on healthy subjects. However, it has not been yet explored in chronic stroke patients. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess whether a FES program over tibial nerve contributes to the rehabilitation of the gait in chronic hemiparetic stroke patients.

NCT04095806,"Background:

A previous study in Zanzibar (which Jutta Adelin Jorgensen, PI of ZanStroke, led) showed a high prevalence of hypertension among adults at 33%, in fact higher than average in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and poor performance of the health systems with nearly 90% of people with hypertension not achieving adequate blood pressure control. Uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) and stroke have already become among the commonest causes of admission to and death at hospital in Zanzibar. At the same time, there is little or no data available to quantify the stroke burden on types, treatment and outcomes, cost of stroke care, nor a comprehensive understanding of the causes of poor hypertension control in the population.The Tanzanian Stroke Incidence study (which Richard Walker from Newcastle University led) showed some of the highest stroke incidence rates in the world. However, there are many unanswered questions, and the Zanzibar Stroke Study will be a unique opportunity to look at all stroke admissions from a large island population.

Zanzibar Stroke Study:

The hypotheses investigated are

1a. Current challenges in stroke care cannot exclusively be explained by limited structural resources, and care delivering processes play an essential role.

b. Current organization and quality of care for stroke including rehabilitation could benefit from being aligned with best practices for low resource settings.
a. Stroke types, causes, and prognosis are dominated by a higher proportion of hemorrhagic strokes, associated to poorly controlled hypertension, higher 30-day mortality, and worse prognosis in terms of disability and mortality at 12 months than seen in high income settings.

2b Long term stroke outcome is not only depending on stroke severity but also on sociodemographic/economic factors with worse prognosis for the poorest part of the population.

3a. There is a significant first stage delay due to local perceptions and beliefs around stroke which prohibits biomedical treatment in the prognostically important acute phase of stroke 3b. There are untapped resources in the community that could be leveraged to increase adherence to medical treatment to control BP to prevent stroke and re-stroke, as well as making rehabilitation accessible 4a. Introducing a hypertension care package at lowest primary care level for people at high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk to prevent stroke and re-stroke is cost-effective, affordable, and possible.

4b. With no intervention, the cost of stroke care at hospital level will in 10 years exceed the cost of all reproductive and child health (RCH) services.

ZanStroke is an observational, prospective study of stroke admissions to hospitals in Zanzibar (Unguja) enrolling all patients with a recent stroke (< 30 days) over a period of one year to investigate the burden of stroke disease, risk factors and outcome up till 12 months post-stroke. This will be done through establishing a stroke patient register.

Participant data will include sociodemographic and -economic information, vascular risk factors and previous medical history, routine head-CT, routine biochemical results and other investigations, as well as early and long-term outcomes (deaths, disability, independence/functionality, quality of life, cognition, medicine adherence, rehabilitation therapy, re-stroke).

Approximately 80% of stroke patients in Unguja, Zanzibar who seek hospital care are admitted to the main hospital and the nearby private hospital, and these will undergo CT head scan, but this will not be possible in all of the other six hospitals. We will take blood samples and store serum and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for potential future analysis from the main hospital and the nearby private hospital only.

In addition to the clinical epidemiological research, qualitative and health economic evaluation research will be undertaken to understand stroke patients and caretakers life worlds and perspectives, health care providers skills and practices, organization and processes of stroke care at hospital level, and to define a set of most cost-effective interventions to prevent and treat stroke in the particular Zanzibar context."

Spasticity, a common impairment after stroke, has a profound impact on activity and participation for patients. According to the result of the investigator's ongoing study, the investigators found BoNT-A injection combined with robot-assisted training is recommended to enhance functional recovery for patients with spastic hemiplegic stroke. However, the optimal program as considering the RT frequency is unknown.

The aims of this study are to determine and compare the immediate and longer-term effects between condensed and distributed programs of RT following BoNT-A injection in subjects with spastic hemiplegic stroke .

Participants with chronic spastic hemiplegic stroke will be recruited and randomly assigned to either condensed or distributed RT groups post BoNT-A injection. Each training session included 40 minutes RT, followed by 40-minute functional training. The condensed group will receive 4 sessions per week, for 6 weeks, the distributed group 2 sessions per week, for 12 weeks.

NCT00132483,"Summary

This study will look at physical exercise after acute ischaemic stroke. It is called the ExStroke Pilot Trial.

Physical activity is associated with a lower risk of first-time stroke. It remains unknown if physical activity also is associated with a lower risk of recurrent stroke. Patients with ischaemic stroke have a 30% to 40% risk of a recurrent stroke during a 5 year follow-up. The risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and death from vascular disease is approximately 15% each. The impact of lifestyle factors on risk for these events is insufficiently covered in the international scientific literature.

Purpose:

The purpose of the trial is to examine whether the level of physical activity increases in patients who have had an ischemic stroke, when they are informed about physical activity and instructed in a physical training program. The occurrence of new cerebro- and cardiovascular events in the patients will be registered. The patients are randomised to receive oral and written information by a physician and a physiotherapist about physical exercise; or to a control group with no instruction regarding physical exercise. Both groups will receive the best available therapy with regard to secondary stroke prevention and will be informed about lifestyle factors.

Irrespective of which group the patients are randomised to, all patients will receive the best possible established treatment with regard to prevention of thromboses; blood pressure control; lipid lowering agents, if necessary; and information about diet, tobacco smoking, and vitamin supplements.

Study Design:

The patients will be randomised centrally within 90 days after stroke onset, and they will be re-examined at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months. Inclusion criteria are patients with ischaemic stroke, aged 40 years or older. In the pilot trial a number of 300 included patients is wanted."

NCT04120467,"Context Dance is an intrinsically motivating activity comprising social interaction, stimulation through music, the joy of moving despite motor limitations induced by pathology, and which has good perceived benefits among participants. Moving with pleasure is essential to finding the motivation to engage in rehabilitation program and physical activity. In stroke context, physical activity and rehabilitation were difficult to carry out because of cognitive and motor disabilities. Moreover, when the rehabilitation is over, the diminishing motor stimulation gradually limits autonomy in daily tasks. It is therefore urgent to provide persons in a post-stroke situation with motivating physical activity opportunities. Very few studies have studied dance in a context of stroke, while this physical activity is highly adapted and effective for other chronic conditions.

Objectives: The main objective is to assess the effects of dance practice on cognitive and motor functions for persons after stroke. The secondary objective is to investigate the effects of dance on quality of life, motivation and adherence. The investigator's hypothesis is that the practice of dance induces an increase of balance and motor capacities, and improving the quality of life, adherence and motivation after a stroke.

Materials and method :

Forty-eight subjects with stroke in subacute phase will be randomized into two groups: 1) intervention (dance and standard rehabilitation) and 2) control (standard rehabilitation). Before intervention, stroke severity, cognitive abilities and motor capacities will be tested. Two baseline tests will occur to assess the stability of individuals will be planned. Participants will attend a dance class weekly during 6 weeks. The cognitive and motor functions (balance, lower-limbs strength, coordination and motor level), the quality of life (Stroke-specific quality of life scale) will be measured at 4 and 6 weeks in both groups. Participant satisfaction with regard to dance will be tested, as well as adherence and adverse effects.

Perspectives:

The joy of dancing and the possibility of including other non-disabled people should facilitate adherence and motivation and increase the recovery of cognitive and motor functions.This project should motivate physiotherapists and dance teachers to increase the offer of dance classes for persons with motor and cognitive impairments.This action will be a basis for combating people's sedentary lifestyle after a stroke."

NCT04582825,"Stroke is the second leading cause of death and one of the main contributors to disability. Patients who survive the acute phase of ischemic stroke and those with transient ischemic attack (TIA) are at high risk of subsequent vascular events. Importantly, recurrent strokes are associated with a higher social and economic impact, higher case fatality, and worse clinical outcome than first-ever strokes. The burden of post-stroke complications, residual deficits, and inadequate medical and psychosocial care all contribute to long-term disability and reduced quality of life in these patients.

NCT03562663,"Motor skill training and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have separately been shown to alter cortical excitability and enhance motor function in humans. Their combination is appealing for augmenting motor recovery in stroke patients, and this is an area presently under heavy investigation globally. The investigators have previously shown that the timing of tDCS application has functional significance, that tDCS applied prior to training can be beneficial for voluntary behavior, and that tDCS effects may not simply be additive to training effects, but may change the nature of the training effect. The investigators have separately reported in a randomized-controlled clinical trial, that upper limb robotic training alone over 12 weeks can improve clinical function of chronic stroke patients. Based on our results with tDCS and robotic training, the investigators hypothesize that the same repeated sessions of robotic training, but preceded by tDCS, would lead to a sustained and functional change greater than robotic training alone. The investigators will determine if clinical function can be improved and sustained with tDCS-robotic training and cortical physiology changes that underlie functional improvements."
NCT02585349,"Stroke is a leading cause of disability, affecting about 34,000 to 41,000 individuals in the Netherlands of middle and old age every year. Due to the aging of the population, this figure will increase considerably over the next decades (Struijs et al., 2005). Twenty-five percent of stroke patients die within one month, making stroke a major risk factor for premature death in developed countries. According to the World Health Organization, stroke is the third leading cause of the burden of disease in middle and high-income countries (World Health Organization, 2008). It has a significant negative impact on quality of life of both the patients as well as their caregivers and significant others. Surviving stroke patients often struggle with its manifold and lifelong lasting consequences, with 35 percent of patients being functionally dependent one year after stroke (Wolfe, 2000) and cognitive and emotional changes which are found up to two years post-stroke (Rasquin, Lodder, & Verhey, 2005). Depression, apathy, and cognitive impairment are very prevalent and significantly contribute to the burden of the disease, but their etiologies remain poorly understood.

The aim of the CASPER study is to gain more insight into the etiologies of post-stroke depression (PSD), post-stroke apathy (PSA), vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), and post-stroke dementia. Therefore, the primary objectives are to identify biomarker-based predictors of PSD, PSA, and VCI. A secondary aim is to study effect modulation, especially the interaction between cerebrovascular disease, neurodegenerative changes and inflammation in post-stroke dementia.

NCT02759328,"Commercial interactive game consoles including the Nintendo Wii™ and the Sony Playstation Eyetoy™ have been used in stroke rehabilitation with variable success and seemed to be safe, feasible and effective treatment options. The more recently released Xbox Kinect™ game console has superiorities to the others such as not requiring any special controller and having a more sensitive sensor which provides more accurate motion-capturing. However, there is limited evidence on clinical utility of the Xbox Kinect™ in stroke rehabilitation. Currently it has been designed for physically and mentally healthy people just like previous consoles. Therefore, the safety and feasibility of the system should be evaluated in first place before using it as an alternative or adjunctive training method in stroke patients. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the clinical feasibility of the Xbox Kinect™ in stroke rehabilitation. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the Xbox Kinect™ training of upper extremity in subacute stroke rehabilitation. The secondary aim was to evaluate its efficacy on upper extremity motor and functional recovery."

NCT04102956,"Acute cerebral infarction is a common type of ischemic stroke, causing brain dysfunction in patients with high morbidity and disability. With the changes in people's diet, lifestyle patterns and population aging, the incidence of acute cerebral infarction has increased year by year, which has become an important cause of disability and death in middle-aged and elderly patients. The human urinary kallidinogenase (HUK) was used in China in the management of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in recent years. However, the mechanism of HUK on AIS has not been systematically investigated. This study aimed to assess the effect of HUK on motor functional outcome and relative corticospinal tract recovery in the patients with AIS. Diffusion tensor imaging(DTI) and diffusion tensor tractography(DTT) have all been used to observe features of cerebral white matter fibrous structures. In addition, diffusion tensor tractography which is used to trace fiber bundle and evaluate white matter fiber bundle integrity and direction is the only non-invasive imaging method to display the corticospinal tract in vivo."

NCT04026399,"More than 4 million stroke survivors in the U.S. suffer from post-stroke sensorimotor hand disability, which is typically permanent and difficult to treat. Hand disability has a profound negative impact on functional ability and independence. One way to improve hand function is to use peripheral sensory stimulation. Sensory stimulation in conjunction with therapy has been shown to improve motor outcomes more than therapy alone. While promising, most modalities of sensory stimulation interfere with natural hand tasks. To address these practical limitations, we have developed a new stimulation, imperceptible random-frequency vibration applied to wrist skin via a watch. In this study, we will determine if use of this vibration increases hand functional recovery."

NCT05069480,"Stroke is one of the commonest causes of severe disability in adults. Stroke often results in spasticity and motor impairments in the upper limb. Permanent upper extremity impairments can lead to limitations in activities of daily living, social participation, and quality of life. Spasticity may obscure motor learning ability after stroke. Spasticity control is one of the main aims of most therapists in the rehabilitation process for patients with chronic stroke. Traditional approaches for managing spasticity may not be enough for gaining satisfactory results. Virtual reality-based therapy is one of the most innovative and developments in rehabilitation technology. It could be effective in accelerating motor recovery and modulating spasticity for the involved upper limbs. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of virtual reality-based therapy on upper limb spasticity and motor functions in patients post-stroke."

NCT03745092,"Chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI) is viewed as an alarming state induced by long-term reduction in cerebral perfusion, which is associated with neurological deficits and high risk of stroke occurrence or recurrence. CCI accounts for a large proportion in both outpatient and inpatient subjects with cerebrovascular disease, while the treatment of CCI remains a formidable challenge to clinicians. Normobaric oxygen (NBO) is an adjuvant hyper-oxygenation intervention supplied with one atmosphere pressure (1ATA=101.325kPa). A plethora of studies have demonstrated the efficacy of NBO on the penumbra in acute stroke. NBO has been shown to increase oxygen pressure, raise intracranial blood flow, protect blood-brain barrier and enhance neuro-protective effects. As the similar underlying mechanisms shared by the penumbra in stroke and the ischemic-hypoxic brain tissues in CCI, the investigators speculate that NBO may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for attenuating short-term symptoms or improving long-term clinical outcomes amongst patients with CCI. Due to the scant research exploring the efficacy of NBO for treating CCI so far, the clinical studies are warranted to verify this hypothesis urgently."

NCT04429945,"Over 15,000 Veterans are treated by the VA for stroke each year. A stroke means that part of the brain dies. Many people who have a stroke have difficulty with moving their arm, using their hand, and they have pain. Virtual reality is a video-game based treatment that may help people with stroke improve in these areas. Virtual reality involves using a computer and goggles to make a person feel like they are in a different world with new sights and sounds, relaxing on a beach where there is no pain, or playing the piano. In virtual reality, stroke patients can practice movement in a safe and motivating environment. For example, a person with stroke who has weakness in his/her arm can safely reach for plates in a virtual cupboard. In a virtual environment, the plates can't break. This study will help investigators to determine if people with strokes who are treated with virtual reality like it, and if they have less pain and better movement."

NCT04641286,"Stroke - still the second commonest cause of death and principal cause of adult neurological disability in the Western World - is characterised by rapid changes over time and marked variability in outcomes. A patient may improve or deteriorate over minutes, and the resultant disability may range from an obvious complete paralysis to subtle, task dependent incoordination of a single limb.

Unlike many other neurological disorders, stroke can be exquisitely sensitive to prompt and intelligently tailored treatment, rewarding innovation in the delivery of care with real-world, tangible impact on patient outcomes. Optimal treatment therefore requires both detailed characterisation of the patient's clinical picture and its pattern of change over time.

Arguably the most important aspect of the patient's clinical picture -- body movement -- remains remarkably poorly documented: quantified only subjectively and at infrequent intervals in the patient's clinical evolution. The combination of artificial intelligence with high-performance computing now enables automatic extraction of a patient's skeletal frame resolved down to major joints, like that of a stick-man, to be delivered simply, safely, and inexpensively, without the use of cumbersome body worn markers. Central to this technology is patient privacy, with the skeletal frame extracted in real time, ensuring no video data, from which patients can be identified, to be stored or transmitted by the device.

Our motion categorisation system -- MoCat -- will be used to study the rapid dynamics of acute stroke, seamlessly embedded in the clinical stream. By quantifying the change in motor deficit over time we shall examine the relationship between these trajectories with clinical outcomes and develop predictive models that can support clinical management and optimise service delivery."

NCT00001368,"Early studies have shown that the immune system may play a role in the development of strokes. Conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and old age can activate the immune system and increase the risk of developing hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and damaged blood vessels.

Researchers will attempt to characterize factors that may contribute to atherosclerosis and stroke by measuring certain components of the immune system, cytokines and leukocyte activation. Measurements will be taken from patients that are considered to be stroke prone and from patients without risk factors for the development of stroke. Researchers will measure the immune system components at the beginning of the study, at six months, and at the one-year completion of the study.

The study will attempt to determine;

I) If patients with risk factors for stroke have an increased activation of the immune system

II) If patients with risk factors for stroke that are symptomatic have higher levels of immune system activation compared to patients who do not have symptoms

III) If patients with increased activation of the immune system have accelerated hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis)"
NCT00001324,"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a technique used to investigate activity in areas of the brain. The PET technique allows researchers to study the normal processes in the brain (central nervous system) of normal individuals and patients with neurologic illnesses without physical / structural damage to the brain.

When a region of the brain is active, it uses more fuel in the form of oxygen and sugar (glucose). As the brain uses more fuel it produces more waste products, carbon dioxide and water. Blood carries fuel to the brain and waste products away from the brain. As brain activity increases, blood flow to and from the area of activity also increases. This is known as regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Knowing these facts, researchers can use radioactive water (H215O) and PET scans to observe what areas of the brain are receiving more blood flow.

In this study researchers plan to investigate the changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as patients participate in different activities. The activities are designed to stimulate the areas of the brain responsible for voluntary motor activity and sensation. By comparing the results of PET scans performed in different conditions, researchers can locate regions of the brain responsible for specific tasks.

This study should provide new information about voluntary movements in humans and the preparation involved in controlling them."

Understanding the mechanisms can potentially lead to the development of interventions to improve motor performance after stroke. The proposed study will examine how synchronously pairing brain and hand stimulation repeatedly affects the plasticity of the brain and motor performance after stroke. The knowledge gained from this study can be useful to develop interventions to improve hand movement after moderate-severe stroke."
NCT00001774,"Fabry's disease a genetic disorder (X-linked recessive) due to the absence of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. The disease is characterized by abnormal collections of glycolipids in cells (histiocytes) within blood vessel walls, tumors on the thighs, buttocks, and genitalia, decreased sweating, tingling sensations in the extremities, and cataracts. Patients with Fabry 's disease die from complications of the kidney, heart, or brain.

The objective of this study is to test the belief that patients with Fabry's disease have a problem with blood vessels becoming larger. The walls of blood vessels contain muscles that when they relax the vessel becomes larger. This process is referred to as vasodilation. It is controlled by a substance released by cells in blood vessels called EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor).

Several drugs can affect vasodilation. Researchers believe some drugs may work by blocking the affect of EDRF. Researchers would like to test the effects of these drugs on the blood vessels of normal volunteers and patients with Fabry's disease."

The mechanisms behind this process are unknown. However, researchers have several theories about how plastic changes take place. Possible explanations include the growth of new connections between brain cells and the use of previously unused connections.

Researchers plan to use transcranial magnetic stimulation and drug intervention in order to determine the mechanisms responsible for specific types of plasticity.

Previous studies have shown that certain drugs can affect the mechanisms involved in these changes. By using one drug at a time, researchers plan to evaluate the role of each of several different mechanisms in brain reorganization."

The study focuses on upper limb retraining for community-dwelling stroke survivors using a robotic device. At the end of training, both movement accuracy and somatosensory acuity in chronic stroke survivors are presumed to improve, and such paradigm is expected to provide reliable benefits as compared to conventional intervention alone."
NCT00001553,"Researchers have been interested in the changes associated with motor function in humans after suffering a stroke. Presently, the mechanism by which a person recovers motor function following a stroke is poorly understood. There is little information available about the areas of the brain involved in the recovery of limb function.

Recently, a new set of techniques have been developed that may be useful for reducing the physical impairment often associated with strokes.

The best way to identify the areas of the brain associated with regaining function is to test patients before, during, and after function is regained.

This study will compare two therapies and determine which is better at improving recovery of motor function. The first technique involves immobilizing the functional limb and actively training the affected dysfunctional limb. The second technique involves no immobilization, and passive movement of the affected limb.

Results from this study will indicate which of the two therapies is better at improving motor function. Additional diagnostic tests will help to identify changes in brain function associated with recovered use of affected limbs."
NCT04957355,"The aim of this study is to describe the effect of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in the form of functional electrical stimulation (FES) applied to different lower limb muscles on reactive balance and gait performance in stroke participants.

Methods: Twenty individuals with chronic stroke will be asked to perform an experimental protocol that includes a postural disturbance in the form of a slip- or trip-like perturbation and a standardized walking test in both laboratory and outdoor environments with and without FES applied to different lower limb muscles of the paretic leg. FES will be applied using an advanced software that is able to synchronize muscle activation with the time of perturbation onset and according to the phases of gait.

This project design aims to examine whether a specific pattern of lower limb muscle stimulation could improve the kinematic and behavioral responses during reactive balance following slip- and trip-like perturbations. Additionally, the project aims to see if the kinematic and spatio-temporal gait parameters can be modified during a standardized walking test under different sensory and environmental conditions."

As the availability of new therapeutic options for the management of acute brain stroke increases, the need to define the evolution of the disease becomes paramount, particularly as therapeutic windows, defined by known and perhaps yet undiscovered parameters, may exist. Defining these parameters will be based on state-of-the-art imaging technology with the potential of clarifying the division between ischemia (reversible damage) and infarction (irreversible). Measures of lesion size and distribution along with vascular morphology, diffusion, perfusion, flow-related, and metabolic measures will be obtained over time.

There is increasing evidence that inherited and acquired coagulation abnormalities alone or in combination with environmental factors, predispose to arterial and venous thrombosis. Inherited abnormalities of factor V Leiden, prothrombin, protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III may account for many of these thromboses. At present there is little information on the existing distribution of these coagulation anomalies in children with thrombosis. Recent reports also suggest that these clotting abnormalities may be responsible for some instances of intracranial hemorrhage, porencephaly, cerebral palsy and fetal death.

This study will measure the frequency of several coagulation factor abnormalities (factor V Leiden, prothrombin 20210A, protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, and antiphospholipid antibodies) in children with a history of porencephaly and stroke, and will compare these to the prevalence of these mutations in population controls and family members.

NCT04124367,"Stroke is a leading cause of adult long-term disability worldwide. Recovery of arm and hand function after stroke is limited to about 50% of patients and full recovery is achieved in only 12% of stroke survivors by 6 months after stroke. Within the first 8-12 weeks post-stroke, a proportional recovery of 70%, corresponding to good recovery, may be achieved, but at later stages no major gain is observed with current therapy practices. Accordingly, there is a need to find new potential therapeutic tools to enhance post-stroke motor recovery. Rehabilitation supported by neuroplastic intervention is a new and pragmatic therapeutic approach in the treatment of stroke, giving way to a concept of 'recovery enhancers'.

The objective of this study is to assess whether an additional therapy with Cerebrolysin and anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) increases the success of conventional rehabilitation therapy in subacute and chronic stroke patients with unexploited potential for functional recovery despite intact structural and functional pathways in the brain.

Hypothesis:

The hypothesis is that the combination of Cerebrolysin and atDCS facilitates motor learning in subacute and chronic stroke patients. Accordingly, motor function recovery at day 21 post-baseline is expected to be higher in the verum group (conventional rehabilitation + task-specific motor training + Cerebrolysin + atDCS) as compared to the control group (conventional rehabilitation + task-specific motor training + placebo + sham-transcranial direct current stimulation).

The primary objective is to show a significantly higher proportional recovery rate in the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) at day 21 post-baseline in the verum group as compared to the control group.

The secondary objective is to assess the impact of this neuroplastic intervention on finger dexterity (Nine-hole peg test - 9HPT), hand grip strength, and neurological deficits (National Institutes of Healths Stroke Scale - NIHSS) at the end of therapy (day 21 post-baseline). Safety data are collected throughout the study and thereafter in case of ongoing serious adverse events (SAEs) at study endpoint.

Optional secondary parameters include electroencephalography (EEG) parameters and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) status analyses to document plastic changes in the brain, in particular changes of the cortical network functionality during neurorehabilitation, and to assess the impact of neuroplastic intervention on the BDNF synthesis rate as well as the influence of different BDNF polymorphisms."

NCT03990545,"Despite advances in stroke care, women continue to face worse outcomes after stroke than men. This disparity in outcomes may be related to biologic sex-differences that manifest in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Decades of cyclic changes in the hormonal milieu lead to different metabolic profiles in women. These changes may also explain sex-differences in risk factor profiles of atherogenesis and plaque composition. The investigators' objective is to conduct a cross-sectional MR imaging study of suspected stroke patients to compare the burden and composition of intracranial atherosclerosis and risk factors between men and women. Results from this study are expected to show that sex and sex-specific risk factors should be considered at the outset of stroke evaluation for risk-stratification. In the era of precision medicine, the investigators propose the role of sex should be a starting point in the clinical evaluation of stroke."

NCT02559739,"Deficient sleep duration and sleep disturbances - such as insomnia, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and restless legs syndrome (RLS)- are associated with hypertension and cardio-cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality. Several studies suggest that sleep disorders are frequent after stroke and detrimental for stroke outcome. However, more prospective studies in a large unselected sample of stroke survivors are needed to better investigate the short- and long-term consequences of sleep disturbances on mortality and occurrence of new cardio-cerebrovascular events. Also their pathophysiological mechanisms and their influence on stroke recovery should be better understood.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the impact of sleep deficiency and sleep fragmentation on the frequency of new cerebro- and cardiovascular events and death after stroke or transient ischemic attacks, and clinical outcome within one and two years after stroke.

The working hypotheses are that stroke survivors with sleep deficiency and sleep fragmentation due to insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing or restless leg syndrome will present: (1) higher mortality from all causes and higher frequency of new cardio-/ cerebrovascular events; and (2) a less favorable clinical outcome. Outcomes will be compared between patients with and without sleep deficiency and fragmentation.

Since current clinical practice in cerebrovascular patients does not sufficiently consider sleep disorders in patient's management, this study can help to bring attention to a still overlooked medical problem and change the current standard of management of stroke survivors."

NCT03418883,"This study evaluates the effects of mirror therapy on upper-limb motor impairment in stroke patients early after their cerebrovascular accident. In recent years mirror therapy has been used in stroke rehabilitation, both to ease motor (e.g., upper limb impairment) and cognitive (e.g., spatial neglect) recovery. To note, mirror therapy is a simple and inexpensive treatment that patients can practice independently and with no significant side effects. However, a recent review concluded that the currently evidence available is not enough to determine about the actual effectiveness of mirror therapy in stroke survivors. Moreover, at our knowledge, the majority of studies recruited chronic stroke patients while only a few trials recruited patients within few weeks after stroke. Therefore, further research is encouraged particularly early after stroke.

In mirror therapy patients exercise their sound hand while it is reflected by a mirror placed at right angle to the patient's trunk. With this gambit, patients see two hands moving: their sound hand (i.e., the hand that is voluntarily moved) and the ""avatar"" of their impaired hand (i.e., the sound hand reflection in the mirror). In this assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial half of participants receive mirror therapy .The other half receive sham therapy, in which the mirror is flipped so that the opaque surface face the sound arm.

NCT04458974,"Introduction

Stroke is the main cause of disability in the world and its sequelae have a great impact in the functional independence and quality of life of patients and families. Unilateral spatial neglect is one of the most frequent cognitive deficits after stroke, and its maintenance is associated with poor functional outcome of the rehabilitation process.

For many years clinical research has been conducted to develop new and effective rehabilitation strategies for neglect. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques are important tools in this regard, and it should be considered as a therapeutic intervention used in combination with conventional neuropsychological approaches. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive, safe, neurophysiological technique able to modulate cortical activity by inducing a weak electric current into the brain.

The studies focused on neglect symptoms treatment by means of tDCS over the lesional and contralesional hemisphere have shown promising results and its combination with conventional neglect therapies may enhance treatment efficacy and speed the recovery.

Objectives

To improve neglect symptoms by reducing the pathological hyperactivity of the undamaged hemisphere after right medial cerebral artery stroke, through the application of multisite tDCS, and to validate a NIBS protocol for the enhancement of conventional neuropsychological rehabilitation outcome.

Methods

The sample will be composed by 30 patients with spatial neglect secondary to a ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery in subacute stage (3 to 12 months since the event). The patients will be randomly assigned to one experimental group (Active, Sham, and Control).

The intervention protocol consists in a two weeks intervention (10 sessions, 45 min, Monday to Friday) of tDCS and neuropsychological rehabilitation applied concurrently. In each session a 20 min tDCS at 2 milliamps (m will be applied over P3 according to 10/20 EEG international system (cathodal) with return electrodes placed in C3,CP5,CP1,Pz,PO3,PO7,P7 (10/20 EEG). StarStim® tDCS 8 channels Multisite device will be used."
NCT03006731,"The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of an exercise training strategy called high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to moderate intensity continuous exercise (MICE), on walking function and cardiovascular fitness in stroke patients. Hypothesis: HIIT will result in significantly greater benefit to fitness and mobility than MICE."
NCT00021710,"This study will try to elucidate learning processes associated with motor training in the weak arm of stroke patients compared with healthy controls. Results from previous clinical trials indicate that training may enhance motor function in healthy volunteers, and perhaps also in stroke patients, even more than 1 year after the stroke. Normal, healthy volunteers and stroke patients 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study.

Study subjects will have a physical examination and participate in 6 additional clinic visits-training and testing sessions on study days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and a final testing session on day 12. During these sessions, they will perform a series of motor tasks, including writing, picking up objects, turning cards, stacking checkers and moving cans, which will be timed and videotaped. Each session will be divided into blocks of 10 trials for each task, separated by 2-minute rest periods.

Before and after training on days 1, 2, 5 and 12, subjects will have transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to determine brain changes associated with learning a motor task. For this procedure, the patient is seated in a comfortable chair, and an insulated wire coil is placed on the scalp or skin. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. These pulses generate very small electrical currents in the brain cortex, briefly disrupting the function of the brain cells in the stimulated area. The stimulation may cause muscle twitching or tingling in the scalp, face, or limb. During the stimulation, the subject may be asked to slightly tense certain muscles or perform other simple actions.

Electrical nerve stimulation and electromyography will be done to record muscle responses to stimulation. A nerve is stimulated by placing wires on the skin over the nerve and passing a brief electrical current between the wires. Electromyography involves taping metal electrodes to the skin over the muscle.

Before and after each session, subjects' muscle strength will be tested with a pinch gauge. They will also be asked to make a mark on a line drawn on paper, to rate their test performance and levels of attentiveness and fatigue."
NCT00028379,"Recent studies have demonstrated that electrical stimulation delivered over the skin increases the muscle strength as measured by a dynamometer in chronic stroke patients. We recently also found out that such stimulation enhances the ability of healthy brains to learn faster, enhancing the beneficial effects of the motor training.

The purpose of this study is to find out if this stimulation can enhance the ability of stroke patients to experience plastic changes in the brain. It may aid in the development of new strategies for rehabilitation after brain injury in the future.

A clinical and neurological exam will be administered. Each patient will participate in three different sessions separated by at least 48 hours: a 2-hour peripheral nerve stimulation to the weak hand, a 2-hour peripheral nerve stimulation to the leg, and no stimulation. The sessions will be randomly ordered. A magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain will be done as well.

Nerve stimulation will be done by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In TMS, the head is immobilized within a frame. An insulated coil wire is placed on the scalp and brief electrical current passed through it. Participants may be asked to perform movements, do simple tasks, or simply tense muscles. Electrical activity of the muscles will be recorded with a computer. Some experiments may be recorded on videotape.

Participants must be stroke patients who have recovered to the point of being able to make thumb movements, and the stroke must have occurred more than 6 months ago."

NCT00028184,"The purpose of this study is to better understand the role of the motor part of the brain in the recovery of motor function after stroke. The motor deficits that follow a stroke are compensated for over several months. It has been proposed that the ipsilateral motor cortex mediates these recovery processes. The results of this study will provide fundamental information on the role of ipsilateral M1 in recovery of motor function after chronic stroke.

A general patient evaluation will determine the location of the lesion site and assess the degree of impairment in motor and global cognitive functioning. An assessment of motor function will also be performed. Patients will be divided into two groups: well and poorly recovered. An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan may also be done if one has not been performed in the past 6 months.

Two main procedures will be performed: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and test of motor performance. In the first procedure, a metal coil surrounded by a plastic mold will be placed on the head and electrical current will be pulsed through it. The electrical muscle activity will be recorded through these electrodes with a computer. The second procedure involves a reaction time test. The task will consist of reacting to a visual stimulus by performing a voluntary movement. TMS pulses will be given before each movement. This is done to determine whether this type of stimulation interferes with reaction time, which would indicated that it interferes with the brain centers executing the reaction to the visual Go-signal.

Patients with single ischemic hemispheric lesions at least 12 months after the stroke who initially had a severe paralysis of the arm will be recruited for the study. Healthy normal volunteers will also be included in the study. A special effort will be made to increase the participation of women and diverse racial groups."

TMS is a procedure that delivers brief electrical currents that stimulate the brain. Studies of a small number of patients have shown that TMS can cause a temporary decrease in activity of the motor cortex.

Healthy normal volunteers and chronic stroke patients may be eligible for this study. Subjects may participate in up to four sessions of reaction time (speed of motor response) testing. They will perform a series of movements with the index and middle fingers of either the left or right hand in response to a signal from a computer monitor. The time it takes to do the tasks will be measured and scored. There will be rest periods during each session.

TMS will be done each session to examine how the motor cortex affects recovery of function after stroke. For this procedure, an insulated wire coil is placed on the scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. Depending on where the coil is placed, the stimulation may cause a muscle twitch (sometimes strong enough to move the limb), a feeling of movement or tingling in a limb, or twitching of the jaw. During stimulation, the subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or to perform other simple actions. The electrical activity in the muscles activated by the stimulation will be recorded using metal electrodes taped to the skin over the muscles.

Subjects will also be asked to draw a mark on a line on paper to rate their attention and level of fatigue, and how well they think they are executing the tasks.

Participants will also have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This procedure uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to provide detailed images of the brain. During the scanning, the subject wears earplugs to muffle loud thumping sounds that occur with electrical switching of the radio frequency circuits. The subject can communicate with the staff member performing the study at all times through an intercom system."

NCT02980354,"Stroke is a life-threatening medical condition that occurs due to a sudden disruption of blood supply to the brain. Although it may affect all age groups including children, the elderly are at a greater risk of having strokes. Indeed, three-quarter of all strokes are seen in people over the age of 65. Unfortunately, due to short therapeutic window (4.5 h of stroke onset), only 2-3% of patients can receive the currently available single medical therapy with rt-PA, a clot-busting agent. As recent studies show that bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells, a type of stem cells, may migrate to the site of injury to repair the damaged brain vessels and tissue, it is possible that their numbers and functional capacity may determine the clinical outcome of stroke patients i.e. severely disabled, moderately disabled or no signs at all. This study will assess these parameters in elderly stroke patients compared to their age-matched stroke-free counterparts and healthy young volunteers."

NCT00037908,"Our overall goal is to develop therapeutic interventions to improve upper-limb motor function in hemiparetic persons based on an improved understanding of the mechanisms responsible for its loss and recovery. We intend to rigorously evaluate the efficacy of these interventions with clinical trials, and to study the mechanisms by which these interventions affect motor recovery. In this proposal, we will use a controlled, randomized, double blind clinical trial to study the effects of shoulder and elbow strength training in subjects in the subacute phase of recovery following stroke."
NCT00037934,"We have established the feasibility and effectiveness of robot-aided rehabilitation in stroke patients using a robot for neurological rehabilitation designed and built by MIT. Results of a pilot study of 20 patients were promising and showed that robot therapy is safe, tolerated by patients and produces a significant, measurable benefit. We propose to test that the robotic upper extremity trainer is an acceptable cost effective adjunct to standard occupational therapy for patients with dysfunction of the shoulder and elbow due to hemiparetic stroke in a VA rehabilitation program."
NCT00037960,"We propose to develop and evaluate a workstation that significantly enhances the application of Constraint-Induced (CI) Therapy by automating and instrumenting several of the tasks currently used in the shaping training. The motivation for development of such a device is as follows: 1) Patients could receive CI therapy at home without the need for constant supervision from a therapist. Many veterans do not have the resources to travel to their local VAMC for the two or three week period required for the treatment. A home-based device would expand the pool of veterans who could receive CI therapy. 2) For subjects who were able to receive CI therapy in the clinic, this device would facilitate an effective post-treatment home-practice program. 3) Currently, patients are treated on a one-on-one basis in the clinic. This device could allow one therapist to treat 3 or 4 patients at one time, thereby substantially reducing the cost of the therapy. 4) This workstation would provide clear and comprehensive quantification of the progress of the treatment. This could indicate on which tasks the patient was progressing most and least rapidly, and would therefore enable effective modifications of the treatment plan while treatment was in progress.

The hypothesis is that the positive outcomes of CI therapy can be achieved, and possibly enhanced, if the shaping training component is performed in a workstation that guides, motivates and records exercise of the more-affected limb. In the first 18 months, the workstation will be designed and fabricated. To expedite the design, we will rely on simple modifications to ""off the shelf"" components. In the last 18 months, a controlled, randomized, clinical trial will compare the effectiveness of automated CI therapy programs with standard CI therapy. The standard CI therapy group would receive shaping training in a clinical setting, one-on-one with a therapist. The clinic-based automated CI therapy group would perform the shaping training in the workstation, in a clinical setting and with minimal supervision. The home-based automated CI therapy group would perform the shaping training at home in the workstation, and with no direct supervision. All other aspects of the three treatment programs will be identical. At the end of this 3-year project, a device will have been designed, built and evaluated that could significantly enhance the application of CI therapy for chronic stroke patients."
NCT05147077,"Post-stroke anxiety (PSA) is a common complication of stroke that leads to dysfunction and reduces the quality of life. PSA exacerbates cognitive dysfunction, delays the recovery process, and increases the disability, mortality, and recurrence rates of stroke. Therefore, early clinical treatments for PSA are important to improve the prognosis and restore the social functions of stroke patients.

Integrated rehabilitation has significant advantages in the treatment of PSA. First of all, there is a wide range of rehabilitation methods, such as acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, which have been proved to be effective for PSA. However, as the application of integrated rehabilitation becomes more and more widespread, its shortcomings are gradually emerging. For example, most of the treatment protocols used in clinical studies are based on personal experience of the investigators, a unified protocol has not yet been formed, treatment methods are still insufficient in standardization and reproducibility. More studies focus solely on the improvement of a certain symptom by a certain rehabilitation therapy, but ignore the important theoretical basis of the ""holistic concept"", thus showing the uneven clinical efficacy. For the above existing problems, it is necessary to conduct original and innovative research."
NCT05434000,"The overall goal of this feasibility study is to establish a standard of care stroke prevention program for children with sickle cell anemia in a community hospital by task shifting stroke detection and transcranial Doppler ultrasound screening to nurses. In Nigeria, approximately 150,000 children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are born annually, accounting for more than half of the total births with SCA worldwide. In comparison, only 1,700 children with SCA are born in the United States annually. An estimated 11% of unscreened and untreated children at increase of strokes with SCA will have at least one stroke by 17 years of age. In high-income countries, evidence-based practices (EBP) for primary stroke prevention in children with SCA involves screening for abnormal transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) velocity (>200cm/s) coupled with regular blood transfusion therapy for at least one year followed by treatment with hydroxyurea is considered standard care. This strategy decreases the risk of stroke by 92%. Due to safety and availability, regular blood transfusion is not a viable option for primary stroke prevention in most low-income settings, including Nigeria, where ~50% of the 300,000 children with SCA are born. Among each birth cohort, 15,000 children will have stroke annually in Nigeria. The American Society of Hematology (ASH) Central Nervous System Guidelines recommends moderate dose hydroxyurea (20mg/kg) to children with SCA with abnormal TCD measurements, living in resource-constrained settings where regular blood transfusions are not readily available. Our team has demonstrated in a previous trial the feasibility of primary stroke prevention with hydroxyurea in Kano, Nigeria. In 2016, as part of capacity building objective of Stroke Prevention Trial in Nigeria (1R01NS094041-SPRING) at Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital in Kaduna, TCD screening was adopted as standard of care. Before the trial, no TCD screening was done at our trial site in Kaduna. Now, as standard care, physicians at the teaching hospital do TCD screening, however, only 5.4% (1,101/20,040) of the eligible children with SCA living in Kaduna, Nigeria were reached. Clearly, for there to be an appreciable impact on decreasing the stroke rates in children with SCA living in Nigeria and elsewhere, applying the ASH guidelines and a better implementation strategy to increase the TCD reach (proportion of children eligible for TCD screening that are screened) is necessary. Therefore, objective of this physician-mentored application is to conduct an Effectiveness-Implementation Feasibility Trial is to test the test the hypothesis that the task-shifted site for primary stroke prevention team in a community hospital will have a non-inferior effectiveness in identifying children with abnormal TCD measurements when compared to primary stroke prevention team in a teaching hospital in Kaduna, Nigeria. the investigators will conduct i) a needs assessment at the community hospital to identify barriers and facilitators to the intervention, ii) Build capacity for stroke detection and TCD screening and iii) Compare the effectiveness of a physician-based stroke prevention program in a teaching hospital to a task-shifted stroke prevention in a community hospital."

NCT00046293,"This study will determine the dose of Retavase that can safely be combined with ReoPro in treating acute ischemic stroke (stroke resulting from a blood clot in the brain). ReoPro and Retavase are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat heart problems caused by blockage of heart arteries. The only therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat ischemic stroke is the clot buster drug rt-PA. This treatment is effective only if begun within 3 hours of onset of the stroke, however, and most patients do not get to the hospital early enough to benefit from it.

Patients between 18 and 80 years of age who have had a mild or moderate acute stroke between 3 and 24 hours before starting study drugs may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood tests, rating of neurological deficits such as cognition deficits or problems walking that resulted from the stroke, and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head. CT involves the use of specialized X-rays to obtain images of the brain. The patient lies on a table that is moved into a cylindrical machine (the scanner) for the imaging study, which usually takes about 5 to 10 minutes.

All participants will receive 0.25 mg/kg of ReoPro (maximum dose of 30 mg). The drug is infused into the vein over 12 hours. Some patients will also receive one of four doses of Retavase, which may boost the effectiveness of ReoPro in opening the blocked blood vessel. Retavase is given through a needle in the vein over 2 minutes. Patients will be monitored daily until discharge from the hospital, or until day 5, whichever is earlier. Assessments will include physical examinations, blood tests to examine factors involved in blood clotting, and CT scans to evaluate both the response to treatment and drug side effects. They will return for a follow-up examination and CT scan 30 days after treatment.

NCT00050128,"This is a preliminary study to evaluate the possible use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), together with exercise, for rehabilitation of chronic stroke patients. It will identify the optimum stimulation settings (within the limits of current safety guidelines) to be used in a later rehabilitation study and confirm the safety of the procedure at these settings. Some previous studies using TMS to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease have shown improvement in motor function; others have not. The results of this study may provide information to help researchers design better rehabilitation treatments after stroke.

Stroke patients with residual arm function and no history of seizures may be eligible for this study. The stroke must have occurred at least 6 months before entry into the study and must have affected only one side of the brain.

For the TMS procedure, subjects are seated in a comfortable chair with their hands placed on a pillow on their lap. An insulated wire coil is placed on the scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the outer part of the brain, called the cortex. This may cause muscle, hand or arm twitching if the coil is near the part of the brain that controls movement, or it may affect movements or reflexes. Subjects are asked to make movements, do simple tasks, or tense muscles. Metal electrodes are taped to the skin over the muscle for computer recording of the electrical activity of the hand and arm muscles activated by the stimulation. The testing lasts 2-3 hours."

NCT05560867,"Stroke is a leading cause of disability that often impairs arm function and activities of daily living. The costs of rehabilitation are significant and practical constraints often limit therapy to the first few months after stroke. However many studies have shown that patients in the later stages post-stroke can still continue to benefit from rehabilitation. Technology-assisted therapy may offer a means to efficiently provide ongoing therapies to patients in the later stages (>6 months) post-stroke. This study will determine which patients are best able to benefit from this therapy approach, and will also expand our knowledge of which brain structures need to be intact for patients to benefit from technology-assisted training. The results of this study will help to improve rehabilitation and quality of life for disabled Americans."
NCT05174949,"Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability. The emergence of abnormal muscle synergies following a stroke presents a major limitation to the recovery of independent function. Despite the development of many interventions for movement recovery post-stroke, rehabilitation treatments are minimally effective to the muscle synergy impairment. Previous studies have found that muscle synergy impairment is associated with the damage to the corticospinal tract and the maladaptive recruitment of the contralesional cortico-reticulospinal tract. The investigators hypothesize that facilitating the damaged cortico-spinal tract (via primary motor cortex) and/or inhibiting the contralesional cortico-reticulospinal tract (via dorsal premotor cortex) will reduce muscle synergy impairment. In this pilot project, the investigators propose to run a proof-of-concept pilot trial to evaluate the effect of the targeted high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) on mitigating muscle synergy impairment."

NCT00056706,"This study will determine whether impaired hand function due to stroke can be improved by blocking nerve impulses to the unaffected arm. Following a stroke, the unaffected side of the brain might negatively influence the affected side. Studies in healthy volunteers show that function in one hand improves when ischemic nerve block (inflating a pressure cuff to block nerve impulses) is applied to the forearm of the other hand. This study will examine whether similar improvement also occurs in the affected hand of patients with chronic impairment after stroke.

Stroke patients with sensory (numbness) or motor impairment (weakness) in the hand that has persisted at least 12 months after the stroke may be eligible for this study. Patients who have had more than one stroke, whose stroke affected both sides of the body, who have a history of deep vein thrombosis (blood clotting), or who are receiving anticoagulant (blood-thinning) treatment at the time of the study will not be enrolled.

Participants will have physical and neurological examinations and will undergo the following procedures:

Session 1

Magnetic resonance imaging (if one has not been done within the previous 6 months): MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. For this procedure, the patient lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a narrow cylinder) and wears earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. The procedure lasts about 45 to 90 minutes, during which the patient lies still up to a few minutes at a time.
Mini Mental State Examination - Patients will take a short test to assess cognitive function.

Sessions 2 (and possibly 3 and 4)

Motor task practice: Patients practice a motor task several times to achieve optimal performance. The task is a rhythmic, repetitive pinch grip at maximal strength at a frequency of one grip every 10 seconds. If technical difficulties arise during the session, the procedure will be repeated in sessions 3 and 4.

Sessions 5 (and possibly 6)

Pinch grip and ischemic nerve block (INB): Patients perform the pinch grip task several times and then INB is applied. For INB, a blood pressure cuff is inflated around the arm at the level of the elbow for 35 to 50 minutes. The procedure causes temporary numbness, tingling, loss of muscle strength, and discoloration or the forearm and hand. Patients repeat the pinch grip task during the INB and again 20 minutes after the INB is released. If technical difficulties arise during the session, the procedure will be repeated in session 6.

Session 7

This session is identical to session 5, except the INB is applied immediately above the ankle instead of on the forearm."

Neuroactive steroids are cholesterol-derived hormones that have the ability to modulate the normal and pathologic nervous system employing genomic and non genomic mechanisms.

In this work, we first investigated if AIS affects the plasma concentration of five neuroactive steroids (cortisol, estradiol, progesterone, testosterone and 3-alpha androstenediol glucuronide). Second, we studied if levels of circulating steroids associate with neurological, cognitive and functional outcome in a cohort of 60 to 90 year-old male and female patients with AIS.

For this purpose, we recruited patients who were hospitalized at the Emergency Room of the Central Military Hospital within the first 24 hours after stroke onset. We designed two experimental groups, each one composed of 30 control subjects and 30 AIS patients, both males and females.

NCT00067275,"This study will examine how dopamine, a brain chemical, affects motor training. Taken by mouth, dopamine can enhance motor training, especially during rehabilitation after brain damage. The study will also examine whether Sinemet, a drug containing a precursor of dopamine, can improve motor training.

Healthy normal volunteers and stroke patients between 18 and 80 years of age may be eligible for this study. Healthy volunteers must be right-handed. Stroke patients must have had a stroke that caused weakness in one hand, from which they have recovered enough to be able to move the thumb in different directions. Participants will have up to three study sessions, as follows:

Prestudy 1 (MRI, TMS with motor training)

Session 1: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. This procedure uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to show structural and chemical changes in tissues. During the scan, the patient lies on a table in a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field. He or she can communicate with the staff administering the test at all times.
Session 2: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) - The subject sits in a comfortable chair with the right forearm held still at the side and the head held still by an aluminum frame. A magnetic coil is placed over the head, and a small probe is attached to the thumb to measure thumb movement. Magnetic pulses are occasionally delivered over the scalp, likely inducing a mild thumb movement. After this test, the subject takes a tablet of either Sinemet or placebo (a look-alike pill with no active ingredient). Fifty minutes after taking the pill, the subject undergoes motor training that involves performing brisk thumb movements at a rate of 1 movement per second. At the end of the training, TMS is repeated.
Session 3: Identical to session 2, except subjects who took Sinemet in session 2 now take placebo, and vice versa.

Prestudy 2 (MRI, PET without motor training, no TMS)

Session 1: MRI of the brain if the subject has not had one within the last 12 months.
Session 2: Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning - This procedure provides information on brain chemistry and function. First, the subject is given either Sinemet or placebo. The subject lies on a bed in a doughnut-shaped machine with a custom-molded plastic mask placed over the face and head to support the head and hold it still during the scanning. A catheter (plastic tube) is placed in each arm-one to inject [11C]raclopride-a radioactive substance that competes with dopamine for binding in certain parts of the brain and can be detected by the PET scanner-and one to draw blood samples for measuring the level of Sinemet in the blood.
Session 3: Identical to session 2, except subjects who took Sinemet in session 2 now take placebo, and vice versa.

Main Study (MRI, TMS, PET with motor training)

Session 1: MRI of the brain, if one has not been done within the last 12 months.
Session 2: TMS, followed by administration of Sinemet or placebo and PET scanning with motor training. The subject lies quietly during the first half of the PET session and performs brisk thumb movements during the second half. After completing the PET scan, the subject undergoes TMS again.
Session 3: Identical to session 2, except subjects who took Sinemet in session 2 now take placebo, and vice versa."
NCT04000971,"Stroke is the 5th leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the United States (US). Stroke is a complex disease with multiple interacting risk factors (including genetic, high blood pressure and cholesterol, and lifestyle factors like smoking, diet, and exercise) that lead to initial and recurrent stroke. Up to 90% of stroke survivors have some functional deficit that impacts both physical and mental health.

Scientific evidence that identifies the best stroke care delivery design is lacking. We completed a three-year, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Health Care Innovation Award that tested a new stroke care design called an Integrated Practice Unit (IPU). This IPU was developed through stakeholder input from patients, caregivers, nurses, stroke specialists, rehabilitation specialists, patient advocacy groups, payers, and technology companies. This IPU design was associated with decreased hospital length of stay, readmissions, and stroke recurrence, as well as lower cost.

Based on the CMS study, a larger, pragmatic trial was developed that is called C3FIT (Coordinated, Collaborative, Comprehensive, Family-based, Integrated, and Technology-enabled Stroke Care). C3FIT will randomly assign 18 US hospital sites to continue Joint Commission-certified Comprehensive/Primary (CSC/PSC) design or to the novel Integrated Stroke Practice Unit (ISPU) design for stroke care. C3FIT's ISPU uses team-based, enhanced collaboration (called Stroke Central) and follows patients from presentation at the Emergency Department (ED) through 12-months post-discharge (called Stroke Mobile). Stroke Mobile includes a nurse and lay health educator team who visit patients and caregivers at home or at a rehabilitation or skilled nursing facility to assess function and quality of life using telehealth technology to facilitate access to multiple providers. Results from C3FIT will provide high quality scientific evidence to determine the best stroke care design that ensures positive health for patients and caregivers."

The purpose of this study is to examine changes in power output, oxygen consumption, cognitive function, and quality of life after 8 weeks of smart trainer arm ergometry exercise training among individuals with post-stroke limb impairment."
NCT00076479,"This study will examine in healthy individuals and in patients with aphasia (a language disturbance that is usually caused by stroke, brain disease, or injury) which parts of the brain are involved in naming everyday objects. In most people, language and speech originate in the left side of the brain. When this side of the brain is damaged, language function is often impaired. Often, however, function partly recovers, possibly because the right half of the brain takes over some language functions when the left half is injured.

Healthy volunteers and patients with aphasia due to stroke may be eligible for this study. All candidates must be 18 years of age and older. Patients' aphasia must have occurred as the result of a stroke that occurred more than 12 months before entering the study. In addition, their stroke must not have affected the brainstem or cerebellum. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, brief physical examination, and questionnaire about handedness. Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:

Session 1: Magnetic resonance scanning (MRI)

MRI is a diagnostic and research tool that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues, including the brain. The subject lies in a cylindrical machine for up to 60 minutes. Loud thumping noises occur when the radiofrequency circuits are switched; this noise can be muffled by the use of earplugs.

Sessions 2 and 3: Picture naming during transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)

For transcranial magnetic stimulation, a wire coil is held on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The subject hears a click and feels a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. There may also be a twitch in the muscles of the arm or leg. During the TMS, subjects are asked to name pictures of common everyday objects that appear on a computer screen. They are asked to name them as fast and as accurately as possible. Their voice is recorded to determine the accuracy of their answers and the time it takes to answer. Subjects may also be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions during the TMS to position the coil properly."
NCT04376138,"With the main goal of generalising findings into Virtual Reality-Neurofeedback-Motor imagery (VR-NF-MI) system, this project aims to develop a new motor rehabilitation tool, for the upper limb, allied to the use of rising of information and communication technologies (ICT). By identifying correlations on the neural activity, during motor imagery and through brain imaging (fMRI), with distinct training protocols and feedback, these protocols are developed to create user-specific models that later can be used in NF-MI rehabilitation sessions."
NCT00072735,"This study will examine the role of an amphetamine in improving the effect that electrical nerve stimulation has over brain flexibility associated with motor training in patients who experienced a stroke more than 1 year before. Chronic stroke is the main cause of long-term disability among adults. Previous studies have shown that electrical stimulation given over the skin may improve patients' recovery of motor function. Furthermore, it is known that amphetamines can improve the effects of sensory stimulation such as touch. Use dependent plasticity refers to a process in which the performance of simple, repetitive finger movements leads to encoding the details of those actions in the primary motor cortex of the brain. Plasticity in this sense refers to the capacity for change in the brain.

Patients 18 years of age and older who have had a stroke, who have no history of other neurological and psychiatric illnesses, and who are able to contrite and perform simple attentional tasks and other tasks may be eligible for this study. There will also be healthy participants as a control group.

Participants will have an electrocardiogram. They will also go through a practice session of about 3 hours in which they become familiar with the different tasks required in the study: motor training, pinch force, and the Jebsen-Taylor Test-which requires doing as fast as possible actions that include writing, lifting small common objects, turning pages, or lifting light or heavy objects. Then during the study, patients will be involved in a variety of sessions:

Motor training alone for about 3 hours.
Motor training, amphetamine (or placebo), and electrical stimulation for about 6 hours.
Motor training, amphetamine, and no electrical stimulation for about 6 hours.

A magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) scan will be done. Patients will lie still on a table that can slide in and out of a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most scans lasting between 45 and 90 minutes. Patients may be asked to lie still for up to 60 minutes at a time. As the scanner takes pictures, there will be loud knocking noises, and the patients will wear earplugs to muffle the sound. Patients will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the scan and may ask to be moved out of the machine at any time.

During another procedure called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a wire coil will be held over the scalp. A brief electrical current will be passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. Patients will hear a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. There may be muscle twitches of the face, arm, or leg. Patients may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions so that the coil can be positioned appropriately. The stimulation is usually not painful, although sometimes strong contractions of the scalp muscles can cause discomfort or a headache. Patients can ask to have the procedure discontinued at any time.

For the electrical stimulation procedure, three pairs of electrodes will be placed on the skin. A quite brief pulse of current will pass between the electrodes, creating the electrical field that activates the brain. Patients will feel a brief stinging around the electrodes. Regarding the amphetamine, patients will take it orally on up to four different occasions. Usually they will take 10 mg of Dexedrin before testing."
NCT00073476,The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new research medication is effective and safe for the treatment of acute stroke when given within 6 hours of the onset of stroke.
NCT00083642,"This study will determine how people who have had a stroke learn to perform a movement by observation, as compared with people who have not had a stroke. Normally, a person learns a new hand movement automatically by observing the movement performed by others. Improvement with practice also relies on visual feedback. This ""observational training"" - i.e., the repeated observation of a movement - is sufficient for normal individuals to learn a movement. This study will examine brain activity related to motor learning in stroke patients and in healthy control subjects to see whether stroke patients process visual-motor information the same way normal subjects do.

Normal volunteers and stroke patients between 18 and 75 years of age may be eligible for this study. Patients must have had paralysis on one side of the body due to a stroke that occurred at least 3 months before entering the study. Candidates who have not had a recent health screening will have a clinical and neurological examination.

Participants undergo the following procedures:

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), if one has not been done recently. This test uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. The subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the cylindrical scanner and wears earplugs to muffle loud noises caused by switching of magnetic fields. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most sessions lasting 45 to 90 minutes.
Task training. The subject practices the task to be performed during functional MRI (see below). The subject makes finger tapping movements, then watches finger movements on a video screen for several minutes, during which time the movie stops from time to time without warning. When the movie stops, the subject must reproduce the last finger movement that appeared on the screen. During this session, the electrical signals of the subject's forearm muscles are recorded at the skin surface. This session lasts up to 3 hours.
Functional MRI. The subject undergoes MRI scanning while performing the same tasks done in the training session. This session lasts about 3 hours."
NCT02664636,"The main objective is to develop models for the cortical reorganization of motor areas and inter-hemispheric equilibrium in the early phase of post stroke recovery evaluated by the fNIRS technique from day 0 to day 60 (day 0 being the day of inclusion in the study) and to correlate the latter with the early phases of motor recovery over the same period, as measured by the test Fugl-Meyer."
NCT05461976,"Practising physical activity after a stroke is essential for the secondary prevention of stroke. However, the major individuals after stroke are sedentary. Individuals after stroke with mild disabilities could have fewer barriers to this practice. Thus, finding ways to promote physical activity after stroke in these individuals is important for them and public health. Interventions that consider behaviour change strategies are a good way to change a habit and could improve physical activity levels. Self-management interventions have been used to promote behaviour change in the stroke population.

The aim of this pilot trial will be to determine the efficacy of a self-management program to increase physical activity levels in stroke survivors with mild disability through 6 home-based sessions of self-management exercise over 3 and 6 months in a low-income country. Our secondary aims are to evaluate the effect of a self-management program on walking, exercise self-efficacy, participation, quality of life, depression and cardiovascular risks after 3 and 6 months."
NCT04550728,"The investigators have developed a novel robot-guided stretching under intelligent control and combine it with active movement training, which helped increase joint ROM, reduce spasticity and joint stiffness, increase muscle force output, and improve locomotion. However, for stroke survivors with sensorimotor impairment, their peripheral muscle may not sufficiently be recruited. Functional electrical stimulation (FES), has been shown its advantage to activate the peripheral muscles for people with neurological conditions. The investigators thus make a hybrid robot-FES rehabilitation system, combining the advantage of robot and FES technologies for stroke motor recovery. The investigators further would like to translate the technologies from lab to home-based training. Thus, the investigators will conduct a randomized, controlled, primarily home-based clinical trial using an ankle robot alone or combined with functional electrical stimulation (FES) to treat sensorimotor and locomotion impairments post-stroke."
NCT02662751,"The main objective of this study is to compare two post-stroke/TIA (transient ischemic attack) imaging strategies in terms of the number of clinically important (i.e. requiring specific treatment according to current recommendations) lesions detected. The first strategy is the current/usual strategy in each participating centre and the second strategy consists in starting the post-stroke/TIA imaging assessment by a whole-body, low-dose angiography and subsequently resorting to elements of the usual strategy if required."
NCT04921683,"When patients survive a severe brain injury but fail to fully recover, they often enter a Disorder of Consciousness (DoC) --that is, a set of related conditions of decreased awareness and arousal including the Vegetative State (VS) and the Minimally Conscious State (MCS). When these conditions become chronic, there are no approved treatments to help bolster any further recovery. In prior work, we have shown the clinical feasibility and potential of Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound Pulsation (LIFUP) as a remarkably safe form of non-invasive brain stimulation in these conditions."
NCT03268070,The goal of the study is to determine the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the premotor cortex on training-related improvements in motor performance and associated neural plasticity.
NCT03247374,"The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate whether the effect of bio-feedback dysphagia treatment is more effective than a control treatment in post-stroke patients.

This study will be a randomized, single-blind controlled pilot study. The investigators intend to recruit 40 patients who have suffered a stroke and have dysphagia. Twenty patients will undergo training with bio-feedback (experimental group) and the other 20 patients will undergo standard training, using only verbal feedback rather than visual feedback (control group).

The authors hypothesize that in the control group the efficacy of the treatment will be lower in the absence of immediate visual feedback of strength and coordination of the swallowing act."
NCT02700945,The purpose of the Stroke AF study is to compare the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) through 12 months between continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring with the Reveal LINQ™ Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM) (continuous monitoring arm) and standard of care (SoC) medical treatment (control arm) in subjects with a recent ischemic stroke of presumed known origin.
NCT02654795,"Stroke remains the most dangerous and frightening complication of atrial fibrillation (AF). Numerous factors predisposing to peripheral embolism in patients with AF have been well defined, documented and included in the CHA2DS2VASC score. Although proper anticoagulation minimizes the risk attributable to ""known"" risk factors, stroke may still occur. Thus, ""unknown"" risk factors may play an important role in stroke risk stratification in patients with AF. The investigators assume that one of the important ""unknown"" risk factor is left atrial appendage (LAA) morphology. The ASSAM study is planned to include 100 patients after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and known status of anticoagulation at the time of stroke. The control group will consist of 100 patients scheduled for AF ablation without a history of stroke or TIA."
NCT00085657,"This study will examine whether brain stimulation using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation therapy can help patients recover strength and motor function more than rehabilitation therapy alone. For tDCS, two small metal disks (electrodes) attached to wires are placed on small cotton pads and taped to the subject's head, one on the forehead above the eye and the other on the top of the head. The electrodes deliver a brief electrical current that stimulates the cortex, the part of the brain responsible for motor function.

Adult patients who have weakness on one side of their body as a result of a stroke occurred within the last 15 days may be eligible for this study. NIH is not directly recruiting patients for this study. Patients will be selected through the National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH) Research Center personnel in Washington, DC, from patients under treatment at that facilitiy. Candidates are screened with a physical and neurologic examination, a review of tests done on admission to NRH, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, if one has not been done since the stroke. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of the brain. The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. During the MRI, the patient lies on a table that can slide in and out of the cylinder. Scanning time for this study takes about 30 to 45 minutes.

Participants are randomly assigned to receive tDCS or placebo stimulation, along with rehabilitation therapy, for 2 to 3 weeks, depending on the patient's length of stay at the NRH. For the placebo stimulation, electrodes are placed on the patient's scalp as with tDCS, but no current is delivered. Before and after each rehabilitation session with electrodes, patients undergo Jebsen Taylor motor testing, in which they are asked to lift small objects, turn cards, use a spoon, stack checkers, and lift cans as fast as they can.

On the day of discharge, patients have physical and neurological examinations and the motor function tests described below. The motor tests are repeated, along with standard care and a review of their health status, during outpatient follow-up visits scheduled at 3, and 12 months. The motor tests are:

Wolf motor function test - Patients are asked to raise a forearm on a table, on a box, to reach across a table, push a sandbag, place a hand on the table, pull a weight, lift a can, pick up a pencil, pick up a paper clip, stack checkers, flip cards, use a key, fold a towel, and pick up a basket.
Barthel index - Patients are timed for the speed with which they perform certain tasks, such as feeding, grooming, or moving a wheelchair.
Abilhand questionnaire - Patients answer questions about how they perform routine daily activities.
GOT test of tactile discrimination - Patients describe objects they feel with their hand.
Ashworth spasticity scale - A medical staff person moves the patient's arm back and forth to see how stiff it is."

NCT00097318,"This study will examine the safety of the drug interferon beta 1a in patients with acute ischemic stroke to determine the highest dose patients can tolerate without serious side effects and to determine the best way to give the medication. Ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot blocking the flow of blood to brain tissue, causing loss or impairment of bodily functions governed by the affected part of the brain. Interferon beta 1a is approved for use in patients with multiple sclerosis to prevent further brain injury caused by inflammation; the drug may also help prevent further brain injury in patients with acute stroke.

Patients between 18 and 85 years of age who have had a stroke and who can begin taking the study drug within 24 hours of onset of stroke symptoms may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination and neurological examinations, blood tests, electrocardiogram, and brain imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans.

Participants are randomly assigned to receive either interferon beta 1a or placebo (an inactive substance). For every five patients enrolled, four receive the study drug and one receives placebo. The dose of interferon beta 1a is increased in successive groups of patients, so that the first group to enter the study receives 11 micrograms (mcg) of the drug, the next receives 22 mcg, then 44 mcg, 66 mcg, and 88 mcg. All patients receive their first dose intravenously (through a vein); additional doses are given subcutaneously (under the skin).

During their hospital stay all participants receive standard medical care for stroke, have neurological checks every 6 hours, and have continuous heart monitoring. To prevent fever, they receive medication, such as Tylenol, before each dose of interferon beta 1a or placebo and every 6 hours as needed while taking the study drug. Routine blood tests are done at 3 and 7 days after the first dose of study drug (or at discharge if the patient leaves the hospital before 7 days) and again at 14, 21, and 28 days. Neurological examinations are done 24 hours after starting the study medication, then every day for 14 days, and again on day 28.

After discharge from the hospital, patients are seen by a nurse every day foan 14 days after the first medication dose. They are contacted by phone on days 17 and 21. On day 28 they return to the hospital as an outpatient for a neurological assessment and blood tests."

NCT03689491,"After stroke, patients often experience motor deficits that interrupt normal lower extremity movement and gait function. Recent developments in neuroimaging have focus on the reasons why some patients recover well while some do poorly. However, there is still no consensus on the exact mechanisms involved in regaining the functions after rehabilitation. Application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to facilitate neural plasticity during stroke treatment has recently gained considerable attention. The possible mechanism through which rTMS acts is based on the interhemispheric competition (IHC) model, which explains that patients with stroke experience alterations in cortical excitability and exhibit abnormally high interhemispheric inhibition from the unaffected hemisphere to the affected hemisphere. The visual feedback training can improve postural control and enhance motor performance. Several rTMS studies have evaluated the lower extremity dysfunction following stroke, but few studies have explored the efficacy of applying rTMS on the lower extremities. We expect the study can help us to further exploration of the change of clinical function and cortical excitability following rTMS and visual feedback training in subjects with stroke. In addition, the results of this project will be provided for further rehabilitation programs in people with stroke."

NCT00151177,"More than half of all stroke patients have sleep apneas in the acute phase after stroke. Sleep apneas may be associated with higher degrees of disability three months after stroke due to numerous factors associated with sleep apneas such as persistent hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and clotting disorders.

Non-invasive CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure)-therapy may reverse a number of these effects very shortly after initiation. The aim of the study is to test the feasibility of early non-invasive CPAP treatment starting in the first night after stroke onset, and to test its efficacy in a randomized clinical trial.

50 patients with acute ischemic stroke will be enrolled and randomly assigned to standard care PLUS CPAP treatment or standard care only. All patients randomized to the intervention group will receive CPAP therapy for the first three nights after stroke. In the fourth night, a cardiorespiratory polygraphy will be performed in patients and controls. Patients assigned to the intervention group with a respiratory distress index > 10/h will be treated further on. On admission, day 4, and day 10 after stroke, diffusion weighted MRI imaging will be performed to determine the size of the infarction. The NIHSS score will be used to assess clinical short-term outcome on day 4 and day 10. After three months, the outcome will be determined using the modified Rankin scale.

As CPAP therapy may be more laborious for the provider, the additional work-load will be documented using pre-specified scales.

Primary hypothesis of the study is, that CPAP therapy is feasible in acute stroke patients and that the additional work load will not outweigh the benefits.

Secondary hypothesis is that patients assigned to the treatment group have smaller infarctions on MRI and less neurological deficits at 3 months after stroke.

Patients entering the study will be investigated by transcranial Doppler ultrasound in case they have sufficient temporal bone windows for insonation and no stenosis or occlusions of major brain supplying arteries by the time of investigation that disturb the intracerebral blood flow.

All intracranial arteries will be assessed before treatment, after treatment and on day 8 after the insult.

Screen shots will be taken and will be analysed by dynamic vascular ultrasound (DVA), a new software algorithm developed by NHSi, to investigate microcirculatory information from the flow spectra of the major intracranial arteries.

The data from this post-hoc analysis are compared with the data of the polysomnography and with treatment.

Primary hypothesis in this substudy is that DVA reliably identifies patients with sleep apnea on days one and four after stroke. Secondary hypothesis is that DVA can distinguish between treated patients and controls."

NCT00166751,"Ultrasonographic examination has long been used to assess the swallowing function. It has the advantages of no ionizing radiation on examination and the possibility of using the real food instead of the barium meal in testing. Thus, the subjects can be examined repeatedly and in a more physiological status of swallowing. However, the ultrasonographic examination is only used in assessing the oral phase of swallowing. It can accurately visualize the tongue movement, measure the oral transit time of bolus, and sometimes the hypoid bone motion, but has not been applied on the evaluation of pharyngeal phase of swallowing. Physically, laryngeal elevation is an essential component of the swallowing movement on pharyngeal phase. It ensures the occlusion of airway and opening of criopharymgeus muscle, and thus prevents the aspiration. To evaluate the laryngeal elevation is crucial point in managing the dysphagic patients.

The purpose of this project is to measure the laryngeal elevation in normal and in dysphagic patients with cerebrovascular (CVA) accident using ultrasonographic techniques. This work will include four group subjects. The first group consists of 20 young subjects (< 40 years); the second group consists of 20 age-matched normal subjects; the third group consists of 20 CVA patients without swallowing problems, and the fourth group consists of 20 CVA patients with dysphagia, which was proven by VFSS. The laryngeal elevation is detected by ultrasound with the transducer placing between the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage. The two markers are easily detected on sonogram because of the presence of acoustic shadow, a specific character of bony structure on sonogram. The distance between the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage before and during swallowing is measures and compared among the groups. The distance change of the patients with dysphagia is further compared with that defined by VFSS. With the result of this study, we will understand the status of laryngeal elevation during swallowing in normal and dysphagic subjects, and further determine the accuracy of ultrasonographic measurement in measuring the laryngeal elevation. With this knowledge, we might extend the usage of ultrasonographic examination on evaluating swallowing function."

Aim 3: To determine the relationships between the impairments in reactive and proactive balance control mechanisms and functional outcome as well as fall incidence in patients following stroke. Aim 4: To investigate the efficacy of different training regimens in improving reactive and proactive balance control strategies and in preventing falls in stroke patients with different brain lesion sites. Principally, three hypotheses are to be tested: Hypothesis 1:The emerging processes and recovery patternes of proactive and reactive balance control may be different among stroke patients with different brain lesion locations.

NCT00167531,"Being able to walk is a major determinant of whether a patient returns home after stroke or lives in residential care. For the family, the loss of the stroke sufferer from everyday life is a catastrophic event. For the community, the costs of being unable to walk after stroke are exorbitant, involving a lifetime of residential care. Therefore, an increase in the proportion of stroke patients who regain walking ability will be a significant advance.

This trial will determine, in patients early after stroke who are unable to walk, whether training walking using a treadmill with partial weight support via an overhead harness will be more effective than current intervention in (i) establishing more independent walking, reducing the time taken to achieve independent walking, and improving the quality of independent walking, and (ii) improving walking capacity and participation 6 months later."

Third, we want to investigate the effect of electrical stimulation on upper limb function in patient with acute stroke."
NCT05461937,"Many people have difficulties organising their behaviour and problem-solving (also known as executive function difficulties) after stroke. This can have serious, wide-ranging consequences for wellbeing and ability to regain independence. Currently, access to psychological interventions after stroke varies and there is not enough evidence to recommend a specific intervention for executive function difficulties after stroke. A short intervention was designed to help with executive function difficulties by making it easier to set goals and achieve them after stroke. The intervention is designed for online delivery to make it accessible to as many stroke survivors as possible. The present trial aims to investigate the acceptability and feasibility of a single blinded randomized controlled trial of this online executive function intervention (active intervention) compared to an online stroke psychoeducation intervention (control intervention)."
NCT00173719,The primary purposes of the this three-year research proposal are to investigate the influence of assistive device use on dynamic balance and the associated attentional demands during standing and walking in patients with stroke
NCT00173992,"The specific aims of this research are delineated as the following:

Aim 1: To investigate the neuromuscular and biomechanical mechanisms of the emerging processes of proactive and reactive balance control during sitting and standing in patients with stroke at different stages of the recovery course.

Aim 2: To determine the relationships between brain lesion sites and the recovery patterns of reactive and proactive balance control mechanisms in patients with stroke.

Aim 3: To determine the relationships between the impairments in reactive and proactive balance control mechanisms and functional outcome as well as fall incidence in patients following stroke.

Aim 4: To investigate the efficacy of different training regimens in improving reactive and proactive balance control strategies and in preventing falls in stroke patients with different brain lesion sites.

Principally, three hypotheses are to be tested:

Hypothesis 1:The emerging processes and recovery patternes of proactive and reactive balance control may be different among stroke patients with different brain lesion locations.

Hypothesis 2:There are positive correlations between the level of impairments in reactive and proactive balance control mechanisms and functional outcome as well as fall incidence in patients following stroke.

Hypothesis 3:Training regimens that could best facilitate the emergence or improvement in reactive and proactive balance control strategies are different."
NCT00173771,"our research team will develop a new CADL scale for stroke patients over the next three years.

In the first year, we had established a CADL item bank of 50 items. The investigators will administer the 50 items on 300 patients with stroke living in the community. Then we will select 10 to 15 items from the item bank for the CADL scale based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), the opinions of an expert panel, and Rasch analysis. It is anticipated that the CADL scale will have unidimensionality, an interval level of measurement, soundly psychometric characteristics, a reduced number of items, and ease of administration.

In the second and third years, we will compare the psychometric properties of the CADL scale and the combined BI and FAI scale. The psychometric properties investigated will include reliability (e.g. inter-rater reliability, intra-rater reliability, and internal consistency), validity (e.g. concurrent validity, convergent validity, predictive validity and discriminant validity), and responsiveness. A total of 150 patients will be recruited. Both the CADL scale and the combined BI and FAI scale will be used on patients from the initial stage (within one month) to six months after hospital discharge. The results will be useful for researchers and clinicians to determine whether the CADL scale is better than the combined BI and FAI scale in stroke patients."

NCT00174044,"Tripping over obstacles is one of the common movements in daily life and is the most frequently mentioned cause of falls in the elderly. Indeed, crossing obstacles is a more complex motor skill than walking, and ensuring sufficient clearance of an obstacle during locomotion requires accurate movement and appropriate modifications of the swing limb. However, little is known about the obstacle crossing deficits that following stroke, especially in good outcome and function independently strokes. It is still a mystery about motor control and motor plastic of central nerve system.

The purpose of the study was to observe and quantify certain characteristics of the performance of subjects following stroke with good outcome to understand the damage of central nerve system how to affect motor control. The present study investigated selected spatial-temporal characteristics, kinematic variables and kinetic variables of the gait pattern to define further the problems in obstacle crossing following strokes. To quantify the deficits, we compared results from a group of subjects with stroke with a group of healthy subjects matched for age, gender, and height."

NCT02856009,"Stroke in elderly subjects has a more severe clinical presentation (in terms of frequency of aphasia, hemiplegia or consciousness disorders), and a worse functional and vital prognosis. Patients older than 75 years also show excess mortality. One of the hypotheses to explain this situation is the high level of frailty in this population. Many tools to measure the concept of frailty have been developed. One important dimension of these tools is the nutritional status. Indeed, protein-energy malnutrition in the elderly, though a frequent situation, is also a complex phenomenon.

The aim of this study is therefore to analyse the impact of protein-energy malnutrition, as a marker of frailty, on the early prognosis (at 28 days) in the aftermath of stroke in subjects older than 75 years hospitalized in Dijon CHU."

NCT04673994,"The objective of this project is to study the cerebrovascular response to a single bout of high intensity interval exercise (HIIT) in 25 individuals with chronic stroke compared to 25 age- and sex- matched healthy controls (CON). We will enroll 25 young healthy adults (CONyoung) as a reference group. Our hypothesis is that the cerebrovascular response in individuals with chronic stroke will be significantly lower: 1) during a single bout of HIIT, and 2) during the recovery immediately following and 30 minutes after HIIT, compared to CON.

This study has 2 visits at the University of Kansas Medical Center Research in Exercise and Cardiovascular Health Laboratory. For the first visit, we will perform questionnaires about heart health, physical activity and overall health. Participants will then complete a submaximal exercise test on a seated stepper. Participants will also have a familiarization session to practice HIIT. The second visit will include cerebrovascular measures before, during, immediately after, and 30 minutes after performing HIIT."
NCT00203710,"The primary purpose is to study the safety and effectiveness of the Concentric Retriever Device(CRD)in ischemic stroke patients who undergo clot retrieval with the CRD within 8 hours of stroke symptom onset. The CRD has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to retrieve foreign bodies (such as pieces of metal) from blood vessels in the body. The CRD is a small metal wire with a loop at the end (like a corkscrew) that removes clots from arteries and thereby restores blood flow to the brain. Prior versions of the CRD may have been too soft to pull out clots, just as a corkscrew that is too soft would not pull out corks. The current version of the CRD is not as soft and may be more effective in retrieving clots. Hypothesis: By restoring blood flow to the brain, stroke symptoms may get better or the stroke may be prevented from getting worse."

NCT00221065,""" Obstructive sleep apnea""(OSA) is a sleep breathing disorder. When a person with OSA tries to sleep the back of the throat closes and blocks the flow of air into lungs.When this happens, a person's sleep is disrupted, causing minor awakenings(which the individual may not recognize). This occurs many times throughout the night, causing poor sleep quality,excessive daytime sleepiness, poor concentration, and sometimes depression.It is possible that poor outcomes observed in stroke patients with OSA result from these neurocognitive phenomena, presumably by reducing effective participation in rehabilitation activities.OSA is treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure(CPAP).CPAP therapy keeps the back of the throat open so that airflow is never blocked.The study is designed to investigate whether treatment of OSA with CPAP improves the results of rehabilitation."

NCT00222339,"Stroke is the leading cause of long-term physical disability in Australia. Currently around 25% of hemiplegic stroke patients discharged from rehabilitation have significantly impaired use of the affected hand with consequent dependence in dressing, grooming and feeding themselves. The poor outcome can be attributed in part to a lack of focus by therapists on the negative signs of stroke (weakness and lack of dexterity) as well as too little time (around 10 minutes per day) being devoted to retraining of the arm. Presently there is a very limited evidence base to guide the content of clinical practice. Results from both animal and human studies suggest that specific post-lesion training can result in substantial improvement in function. The hypothesis is that task-specific training of the affected upper limb to subjects in the early period following stroke will result in significantly better functional outcome than standard intervention."

NCT00242242,"This study will gain information on methods of control of a prosthetic arm in stroke patients or traumatic brain inury patients through a technique called ""brain-computer interface"" (BCI). BCI allows for direct communication between man and machine. Brain cells communicate by producing electrical impulses that help to create such things as thoughts, memory, consciousness and emotions. In BCI, brain waves are recorded by an electroencephalogram (EEG) through electrodes (small wires) attached to the scalp. The electrodes measure the electrical signals of the brain. These signals are sent to the computer, which translates them into device control commands as messages that reflect a person's intention. This type of brain activity comes from the sensorimotor areas of the brain and can be controlled through voluntarily training to control the hand prosthesis through the BCI.

Healthy normal volunteers and people who have had a stroke or traumatic brain injury more than 12 months ago and have paralysis in the right or left arm, hand or leg and who are between 18 and 80 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a clinical and neurological examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of the brain. The scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. During the procedure, the subject lies in the scanner for about 45 minutes, wearing ear plugs to muffle loud knocking sounds that occur with the scanning.

Participants undergo the following procedures:

Sessions 1-2: Participants are connected to an EEG machine and familiarized with the hand orthosis (training device used in the study) and the tasks required for the study.
Sessions 3-4: Participants receive baseline transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and fMRI. For TMS, a wire coil is held on the scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The subject may feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil and there may be twitching in muscles of the face, arm or leg. The subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected with small metal disk electrodes taped to the skin of the arms. fMRI is like a standard MRI (see above), except it is done while the patient performs tasks to learn about brain activity involved in those tasks.
Sessions 5-8: Participants are asked to repetitively move their hand (patients' paralyzed hand; healthy volunteers' normal hand), tongue and leg in response to three sound tones. After ten trials, they are asked to imagine the same movements 50 to 100 times while the EEG machine is recording brain activity.
Sessions 9-14: Participants are trained in controlling the hand orthosis. The subject's hand is attached to the orthosis and asked to imagine that they are performing finger or hand movements. This continues until there is an 80-90 percent success rate in achieving hand movement.
Sessions 15-16: Participants repeat TMS and fMRI for comparison before and after training with the hand orthosis.
Sessions 17-28: Participants receive additional training with the hand orthosis device (as in sessions 5-8), focusing only on the hand and not other parts of the body.
Sessions 29-30: Participants undergo repeat TMS and fMRI to compare with the effect following additional training with the hand orthosis.
Sessions 31-32: Optional makeup sessions if needed because of scheduling problems.

Participants are evaluated in the clinic after 3 months to see if they have benefited from the study."

NCT00247533,"There are many reports about the association of coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebral artery stenosis (CAS), which had been proved to induce stroke and cognition decline after the revascularization including coronary bypass surgery (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention. Perfusion defect on nuclear brain scan is also noted to correlate with these neurological complications. On the other hand, the perioperative arrhythmia and following cerebral embolism was also attributed to be one factor inducing such neurological hazards.

In the patients with coexistent CAD and CAS (1st group), and also the patients scheduled for CABG or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (2nd group), we, the researchers at Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, attempted to integrate all the parameters mention above, including angiography of coronary and cerebral system, quantitative analysis of nuclear brain scan, biochemical profile, and signals of a new ambulatory device which could record the electrocardiograph (ECG) and electroencephalograph (EEG) simultaneously, in order to define the correlation between them. A chorological relation between EEG signals and ECG signals is our first target to be worked out. Thereafter, we hope to establish a regression model of all involved parameters according to the relation. Such a model, we believe, is essential not only to explain the post-CABG neurological complications, but to prevent them.

Furthermore, for the undetermined ischemic stroke patients who had no obvious culprit artery or embolism source, the paroxysmal arrhythmia had long been regarded as the cause. Whether a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which had not been disclosed by routine ECG, could induce most of such a stroke is still not known. With this new ambulatory device which could record the electrocardiograph (ECG) and electroencephalograph (EEG) simultaneously, we want to answer the question."

NCT00253825,"The purpose of the current study is to evaluate relative efficacy of (1)modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) combined with eye patching, (2)mCIMT, and (3) traditional rehabilitation on motor, attentional, and activities of daily living functions in stroke patients with unilateral neglect (UN). UN represents a failure to respond or orient to stimuli presented contralateral to a brain lesion. Constraint-induced movement therapy is made up of a family of treatment that involve repeatedly practicing use of the affected limb and constraining use of the unaffected arm in the clinic and at home. mCIMT is an intervention based on modifications to conventional CIMT by distributing practice sessions to a longer period of time. mCIMT attempts to supplement the inadequacy of the current rehabilitation programs and to fit better into rehabilitation schedules. This technique has been suggested to be especially relevant for treatment of patients with UN.Half-field eye patching involves occlusion of the hemifield of both eyes (in the case of left UN, the right hemifields of both eyes). Patching the ipsilateral hemifield is believed to increase activation of the involved hemisphere, resulting in increased attention to the contralateral neglected side.

Despite the promising relevance of mCIMT for rehabilitation of patients with hemiplegia, it remains unclear whether mCIMT is effective for alleviating UN. A further issue that warrants investigation is the combined effects of mCIMT and eye patching. Both approaches involve the use of controlled sensory input that may lead to increased activation of the lesioned hemisphere. Integration of both approaches may be more efficacious than mCIMT without direct intervention for UN. This project is proposed to study the combined effects of both approaches. It is hypothesized that combining both approaches will be more effective than mCIMT, which is hypothesized to be superior to traditional rehabilitation involving the same amount of therapy time. To test the hypotheses, 60 patients with unilateral stroke and UN will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups (i.e., mCIMT and eye patching, mCIMT, and traditional rehabilitation). Testing for UN will include the use of the line bisection test, cancellation tasks, and examination for extinction to double simultaneous stimulations.

The outcome measures will include traditional motor function tests, kinematic analysis, a circle discrimination test, and daily life functional measures. Each eligible participant will be tested before and immediately after the assigned intervention and at three months and six months after the treatment. Each type of treatment will be three-week long. Multivariate analysis of covariance will be used to analyze the obtained data in order to test for the relative effects of the three treatments. Each participant will be tested for motivation for participating in treatment sessions using the Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale. It is hypothesized that patients with higher participation will improve more than those with lower participation.

The uniqueness of this proposed project pertains to (1)modification of the CIMT protocol in a more feasible way; (2)concurrent use of mCIMT and eye patching for treating UN post stroke; and (3)use of kinematic analysis for detecting precise changes in motor behavior post intervention. Kinematic analysis is relevant for identifying trajectory control deficits that may accompany clinically ""recovered"" UN.

NCT05522244,"Embolic strokes of undetermined source (ESUS) represent a subset of cryptogenic strokes that are suspected to have an occult embolic source. The risk of stroke recurrence in patients with ESUS varies between 1.9%/year and 19.0%/year depending on the prevalence of vascular risk factors. Part of the elevated recurrence rate is due to the inability to identify high-risk treatable causes such as cardiac thrombi as those found in the LAA.The most frequently used diagnostic method in clinical practice to detect an LAA thrombus is transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). However, the relatively low availability, higher cost, and invasive nature of TEE limit its large-scale usability. In most stroke centers, patients presenting with an acute ischemic stroke or TIA undergo a tomography (CT) angiography (CTA) of the neck and intracranial vessels. This standard of care CTA (sCTA) classically includes the aortic arch, the higher portion of the ascending/descending aorta, and the rostral portion of the cardiac chambers, but does not involve the LAA. A recent study performed among 300 patients with an acute ischemic stroke showed an overall LAA thrombus detection of 6.6% and 15% in patients with AF by extending the CTA 3 cm below the carina.This is an extraordinarily high prevalence of LAA compared to 0.5% to 4.8% of intracardiac thrombi identified on TEE in most previous studies. The major limitation of previous CTA and TEE studies is their observational design, so the differing prevalence of LAA thrombi could be explained by dissimilar population characteristics. Based on the methodological limitation of prior studies and the promising role of extended CTAs (eCTA), a randomized controlled trial comparing eCTA + standard of care stroke workup vs. sCTA + standard of care stroke workup is needed."
NCT02759627,"Stroke is one of the major cause of morbidity and mortality and the leading cause of disability in adults all around the world. Stroke survivors can suffer several neurological impairments and deficits which have an important impact on patient's quality of life and which increase the costs for health and social services. After stroke, impairments in ADLs and functional status, deterioration in health related quality of life can be seen.

Although most of the stroke survivors experience some level of neurological recovery, nearly 50%-60% of stroke patients still experience some degree of motor impairment, and approximately 50% are at least partly dependent in activities-of-daily-living (ADL). Gait recovery, performing activities of daily living and regaining independence in ADLs are the main focus of stroke rehabilitation programs.

Robotic technologies are becoming more promising techniques for the locomotor training in stroke patients. Achieving a functional walking level is one of the target of robotic gait training and it has been shown that Robotic-Assisted Gait Training (RAGT) improves walking function in stroke patients. Having a functional gait level may help the stroke patients to regain independence in ADLs and improve quality of life.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of RAGT on functional status, ADLs and health related quality of life."

NCT04751708,"Rationale: Recently, two prospective multicenter RCT reported a potential beneficial effect of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in patients with an acute symptomatic basilar artery occlusion (BAO). However, the high rate of crossover in BEST study and the long-term of recruitment in BASICS study influenced the validity of the results. Besides, a recently prospective clinical registry with large sample size (BASILAR) showed a significantly beneficial effect of EVT in BAO patients.

Objective: To assess the effect of EVT in addition to best medical management (BMM) compared to BMM alone, in patients with BAO, caused by a CTA/MRA confirmed occlusion of the basilar artery on functional and safety outcome.

Study design: This is a parallel group, randomized clinical trial of EVT with BMM versus BMM. The trial has observer blind assessment of the primary outcome and of neuro-imaging at baseline and follow up.

Study population: Patients with acute ischemic stroke and a confirmed basilar artery occlusion by CTA/MRA.

At the same time, we will take the opportunity to do an explorative study with the aim to further improve the intervention by biomarkers, and outcome measures volumetric measured by MRI images.

The intervention study aim to:

Determine the time from symptom onset to thrombolytic treatment in the Mobila Stroke Unit (MSU) compared to the conventional model
Determine the number of patients receiving thrombolytic treatment within the 4.5 hrs window in the MSU compared to the conventional model
Determine if thrombolytic treatment in the MSU, when adjusted for time, results in better mRS- and Barthel outcome compared to treatment in the conventional model The explorative study aim to

Hypothesis Intervention study I. The Treat - NASPP MSU model is feasible and reduces onset to treatment time less than 15 min II. The number of patient treated with thrombolysis within 4.5 hrs of symptom onset is significantly increased in the Treat-NASPP MSU model III. Treatment in the Treat-NASPP MSU model does not result in increased day 90 mRS and Barthel as compared to the conventional model when adjusted for time IV.

NCT03740971,"The current treatment based on evidence-based medicine for acute ischemic stroke mainly includes reperfusion (intravenous thrombolysis, mechanical thrombolysis), anti-platelet and stroke units. About 1/3 patients can obtain good prognosis through intravenous thrombolysis. Good prognosis can be gotten from about 50 percent of patients with big artery disease by mechanical embolization. However, only a small proportion of the population can be treated with restoration perfusion in the time window. The main purpose of antiplatelet therapy is to prevent the recurrence and progression of stroke, and stroke unit is a kind of management mode. How to improve the neurological function of patients has been a hot and difficult problem in clinical practice.

A large number of basic and clinical studies have proved that remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) has protective effect on ischemic stroke. Hahn et al showed that RIC could play a neuroprotective role in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in MCAO model. Other studies have also confirmed that preconditioning RIC has a neuroprotective effect on cerebral ischemia in animal models. One open label study by Hougaard et al shows that RIC can improve the NIHSS score in acute ischemic stroke patients. One recent study found that 300 consecutive days RIC therapy for the patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis significantly reduced the recurrence rate of stroke, improved the mRS score and recovered the blood flow in the lesion site. Furthermore, several studies have also shown that RIC can not only improve the neurological function of patients with cerebral infarction after intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombolysis, but also protect the secondary brain injury after carotid stenting. These results suggest that RIC has a neuroprotective effect on ischemic stroke and deserves further study.

Based on the above discussion, this study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of RIC in the treatment of acute moderate ischemic stroke."

NCT03870672,"This study is a necessary and important step in the development of a new therapy for upper limb functional recovery in patients with severe motor impairment. It is the first clinical trial of non-invasive brain stimulation (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or rTMS) delivered to excite the undamaged hemisphere (specifically the contralesional higher motor cortices or cHMC) in stroke. Therefore, this study will determine whether the positive results obtained in our short-term pilot study can be made to last longer and produce functional benefits in severe patients with the application of brain stimulation in combination with long-term rehabilitation therapy. Rehabilitation therapy administered is called contralaterally controlled functional electrical stimulation (CCFES). Determining whether combining rTMS facilitating the cHMC with CCFES produces synergistic gains in functional abilities in severe patients is necessary for acceptance by the clinical community and to move this technology toward commercialization and widespread dissemination. The proposed study will determine whether the combination of rTMS facilitating the cHMC with CCFES produces greater improvements in upper extremity function in severe participants who are ≥6 months from stroke onset than the combination of rTMS facilitating the damaged hemisphere (specifically the ipsilesional primary motor cortex, iM1) and CCFES or the combination of sham rTMS and CCFES. The secondary purposes are to define which patients benefit most from the treatments, which may inform future device and treatment development and clinical translation, and to explore what distinct effects the three treatments have on the brain. To accomplish these purposes, we are conducting a clinical trial that enrolls severe stroke patients."

NCT05183672,"Since 2017, Hong Kong has provided post-acute stroke services in clinics operated by stroke advanced practice nurses (APNs). Currently, the applicability of the clinics has been further limited by the emergence of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic due to restrictions on visits to the clinics and tightened social distancing requirements. Telecare consultations may be a viable option for contributing more flexible, interactive, and cost-efficient care models to support stroke survivors over the longer run. The present study takes advantage of this opportunity by utilizing implementation science to simultaneously implement and evaluate a telecare model of care in a nurse-led post-acute stroke clinic."
NCT04417231,"CASTRO1 is a study to investigate the reduction of C-reactive protein (CRP) by therapeutic apheresis (CRP-apheresis) in patients after primary treatment of ischemic stroke.

The term therapeutic apheresis commonly refers to medical procedures, where pathogenic constituents are being removed from the circulating blood. Elimination is performed by adsorbers outside the body in an extracorporeal circulation. For removal of the pathogenic substances the plasma is separated from the blood (circulation) to pass the adsorber. The purified plasma is merged with the solid blood components thereafter and returned to the patient.

The adsorber ""PentraSorb® CRP"" used for CRP apheresis is CE-certified. It is designated to the selective depletion of C-reactive protein from human blood."
NCT02611440,"Medication adherence is a major factor to prevent vascular recurrence after a first ischemic stroke. Nevertheless, it is suboptimal and the implementation of specific interventions are needed to improve it.

A patient - centered and pluriprofessional structured intervention, targeting the medication, introduced at hospital discharge and continued at home (by regular telephone contact) could improve medication adherence one year after stroke.

This intervention would consist of semi structured interviews patient-pharmacist at different times during one year after stroke. The information about the therapeutic management of the patient will be shared between healthcare professionals : general practitioners (GP) and community pharmacists (CP), hospital clinical pharmacist (HCP) and physician (HPhys).

It will allow for decrease of the recurrent stroke and others cardiovascular complications based on a better adherence to preventive medication. Furthermore the decrease of the iatrogenic events and the improvement of the quality of life of patients may be also associated."

NCT02606890,"The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to investigate the relationship between lesion pattern on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and atrial fibrillation in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The investigators hypothesize that a pattern with lesions located in at least two of the main arterial territories of the brain (left or right internal carotid artery or posterior circulation territory) is associated with atrial fibrillation.

The investigators will retrospectively analyze clinical data and imaging lesion pattern of 1000 consecutive patients who were admitted to the Department of Neurology (Charite - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin) and diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke.

Acute stroke patients of this cohort underwent 3-Tesla MRI with Diffusion-weighted Imaging (DWI) and Fluid-attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) sequences as well as standard 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) on admission and cardiac monitoring with automated arrhythmia detection during stroke unit care lasting at least 24 hours.

If DWI and FLAIR lesions are located in more than one of the main arterial territories, lesion pattern will be categorized as ""multiple lesion pattern"".

The investigators hypothesize that a multiple lesion pattern will be detected more frequently in acute stroke patients with atrial fibrillation than in patients without atrial fibrillation.

The findings of this study might help to identify patients who could profit from extended diagnostic work-up in order to detect atrial fibrillation."
NCT02604667,"The purpose of this study is to better understand the causes of stroke in people with cancer. Active cancer increases the risk of stroke. The investigators do not know exactly why this occurs but one possible reason is that people with cancer may have thicker blood than people without cancer. Thick blood can sometimes cause blood clots to form in the heart, which can then travel to the brain and cause stroke. This study is being done to help figure out why this and other causes of stroke occur in people with cancer. The investigators expect that information from this study will help doctors to more effectively prevent and treat stroke in individuals with cancer."

NCT02594995,"Stroke is the first leading cause of death in China, and is responsible for almost 22.4% of deaths. In approximately 80% of cases stroke is ischaemic, i.e. caused by disruption of blood flow to part of the brain from an acute arterial occlusion. Survival of penumbral tissue distal to an arterial occlusion depends on collateral circulation via the Circle of Willis and leptomeningeal anastomises. Collateral flow is dynamic and failure is associated with infarct growth. The presence of adequate collaterals has been shown to be associated with age, history of statin use, and non-hypertension.

NCT02578979,"Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is often undetected because characteristics such as short duration, episodic, and frequently asymptomatic nature make it challenging to diagnose at the bedside, leading to suboptimal secondary prevention. It is not uncommon for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to be undetected in a single electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission. Conventional 24-hour Holter monitoring is often used to detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. However, systematic review suggests Holter monitoring will identify atrial fibrillation in only an additional 4.6% of patients, no better than detection rates observed in groups lacking routine monitoring. On the other hand, for ischemic stroke patients with sinus rhythm at baseline but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation still suspected, no recommendation beyond repeated 12-lead ECGs is made in the United Kingdom guideline. Serial 12-lead ECG has been used to detect possible paroxysmal atrial fibrillation among acute ischemic stroke patients and found 15 new cases of atrial fibrillation in 133 acute ischemic stroke patients (11.3%) without atrial fibrillation at baseline. The optimal investigation strategy, including modality, duration of investigation, and patient subgroup remains undefined, not only for efficacy in the detection of atrial fibrillation, but also cost-effectiveness in healthcare systems. The objective of this project is to conduct a pragmatic multicenter randomized controlled trial for the comparison of serial 12-lead ECG once daily for 5 days and 24-hour Holter to detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in acute ischemic stroke patients without atrial fibrillation identified by baseline ECG or history."

NCT03721354,"Partial assisted mechanical ventilation modes are widely used to manage respiratory failure. It has been demonstrated that they can reduce complications related to mechanical ventilation and neuromuscular blocking agents administration.

During partially assisted ventilation, there is no predefined respiratory rate and the patient must trigger each breath.

One of the most used partial assisted mode is pressure support ventilation (PSV), which plays a key role in weaning from mechanical ventilation, especially in neuro-cranial diseases.

Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist mode (NAVA) has been introduced in clinical practice in recent years. It has been widely demonstrated that NAVA is able to guarantee gas exchange in the same way as PSV in patients admitted to ICU for respiratory failure.

Thus, NAVA can improve patient-ventilator interaction reducing the incidence of asynchronous events and favoring the patient's own ventilatory pattern. Nevertheless, NAVA does not appear to have been applied in neuro ICU patients. In a study conducted on non-neurosurgical infants has been demonstrated negative effects of asynchronous events on cerebral blood flow velocities, examined with transcranial Doppler technique.

In the present pilot study, the investigators would like to compare NAVA and PSV ventilation influence on cranial blood flow, evaluated with Trans-Cranial Color Doppler, in patients admitted to ICU for neurological injuries."
NCT02572336,"This study will test the experimental drug ""THR-18"" given together with the drug ""tissue plasminogen activator"" for the treatment of stroke. Tissue plasminogen activator is also called ""tPA"".

Strokes often result from blockade of blood supply caused by blood clots forming within the blood vessel feeding the brain. Such strokes are called ""Ischemic strokes"". Treatment of these strokes is aimed at breaking up the blood clot(s) and renewing the blood flow before further parts of the brain die. Breaking up the blood clot is possible with the drug tPA when it is injected into a vein shortly after the stroke starts. However, along with breaking up the blood clot, tPA sometimes causes adverse effects, for example, it may cause bleeding. THR-18, the drug tested in this study, is meant to reduce tPA's adverse effects without stopping tPA's breaking up of the blocking blood clot.

The aims of this study are to evaluate the safety of THR-18 in acute ischemic stroke patients who are treated in parallel with tPA, to measure tPA's effect on blood clot dissolution when this drug is given with and without THR-18, and to study the effects THR-18 may have on signals of brain damage as seen on brain computerized tomography (a type of brain x-ray) after treatment with tPA with and without THR-18. Patients will also be evaluated for their ability to perform daily activities after the stroke following tPA treatment with and without THR-18.

The evaluation of THR-18 in this study will be done in comparison to placebo. Placebo is a drug that looks exactly like THR-18 but has no activity. One dose of THR-18 will be tested, in 20 patients. In parallel, 20 other patients will receive placebo. In total, 40 patients are planned to participate in this study. The decision whether a patient will receive THR-18 or placebo will be based on chance (this procedure is called ""randomization""). This clinical study will be conducted only at one hospital, in the Republic of Moldova. The patients will be in the hospital for at least 3 days after receiving the study treatment. Then, about 1 month later, they will be invited for a last follow-up visit."

NCT02550392,"Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA), also called 'ministroke' is characterised by shortlasting symptoms that generally do not cause permanent damage. 'Minor stroke' is a term used to describe a stroke with mild and nondisabling symptoms. TIA and minor stroke patients account for more than half of all cases of stroke and they are at a higher risk to suffer a major stroke. Currently, management of TIA/minor stroke patients is mainly focused on identifying and reducing risk factors for a later stroke. However, people after a TIA often have limited access for further specialist support from stroke-specific rehabilitation services. Although there is variability in the level of recovery and severity of symptoms after TIA and minor stroke, there is evidence that these patients may experience difficulties that affect their quality of life including anxiety and depression.

This study aims to develop, tailor and target the delivery of a time-limited group intervention that offers educational, psychological and social support for people following TIA and minor stroke. A qualitative study (Phase 1) will be conducted with service users and experts working with people with TIA/minor stroke to develop the psychoeducational intervention. Following this, we will conduct a feasibility randomised controlled trial in one centre (Phase 2) to explore whether this group psychoeducational intervention for people after TIA and minor stroke carers is acceptable and to determine the feasibility of the proposed evaluation and the sample size needed in a definite trial."

NCT04296981,"At CHUS Fleurimont, one in five patients hospitalized for this condition needs to be transferred to an intensive functional rehabilitation unit (URFI) located in another establishment of the Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de service sociaux de l'Estrie - Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke (CIUSSS de Estrie-CHUS). Patients and their relatives must therefore adapt to a new environment and a new care team, which can cause additional concern and uncertainty for their new condition. Thus, the importance of educating the patient and their family so that they understand the nature of the stroke, as well as the elements and stages of rehabilitation that lie ahead, are essentials so that they can make an informed choice about acceptance and type of rehabilitation.

NCT02541032,"The PREMIERS study is a proposal for conducting an adequately powered two center phase III randomized controlled trial to test whether intensive periodontal treatment reduces the risk of recurrent vascular events among ischemic stroke and TIA survivors. The study uses the resources in both states including established dental centers, Joint Commission Certified Stroke Centers, the Schools of Public Health, and the Institute for Partnerships to Eliminate Health Disparities. The proposal addresses specific issues with regards to recruitment of African-American and rural stroke/TIA patients advocating the use of culturally appropriate strategies to educate the study subjects regarding stroke, periodontal disease and the periodontal stroke link.

The study proposes to utilize economic evaluation of the periodontal intervention from the budgetary perspective. The focus will be on the financial sustainability of providing aggressive periodontal therapy (with certain, although relatively low expenditures) in exchange for a reduction of uncertain recurrent vascular events that may require high cost emergency department utilization and/or inpatient care. The sustainability of the proposed intervention after the completion of the project is integrally linked to the health economic assessment to show the health care cost savings. By integration with a rural primary care center, with an African American majority and households with average incomes below the state average, the study ensures that the proposed intervention to reduce stroke disparity is applicable to this target population."

NCT02541578,"Physiological complexity of gait, a measure of the interaction of multiple control mechanisms for walking within a biological system, is decreased in persons with chronic stroke compared to those without disability. Thus, it is assumed that the quantification of gait complexity represents the adaptability and health of the individual. However, it is unknown if the level of gait-related complexity improves over time with recovery from stroke. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to determine if the physiological complexity of gait changes over the first six months post stroke within the contemporary healthcare environment. Secondary aims include 1) determining if there is a difference between the amount of physiological complexity of gait and lateralization of hemispheric damage after stroke and 2) exploring the relationship of complexity to lower extremity motor impairment, walking speed and balance. Sixty individuals within one month post stroke from the greater Indianapolis area will be recruited for this prospective, longitudinal outcomes study. Testing sessions will occur at intervals across the first six months post stroke: within 1 month, at 3 months, and at 6 months post stroke. During each testing session, participants will complete a 2-minute walking task during which accelerometer signals from wireless inertial measurement units will be collected and converted to sample entropy to quantify the physiological complexity of gait. Additionally, measures to quantify lower extremity motor impairment, walking speed and balance will be collected and analyzed. Changes in complexity of gait from early to later stages of stroke recovery may serve as a foundation for prognosticating outcomes, such as predicting capacity for community mobility and/or risk of fall. The proposed study will meet a critical need to develop methods that differentiate among capacities for adapting movement patterns in individuals with neurological dysfunction. This work will ultimately build upon evidence that will assist therapists in tailoring interventions in such a way to optimize function."

NCT02537652,"Individuals who experience a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) are at heightened risk of subsequent vascular events, including heart attacks and secondary stroke/TIA. Blood pressure control is considered the most important contributor to positive health outcomes in stroke patients. The measurement of central blood pressure (cSBP) (the blood pressure which is being exerted at the heart), may provide clinicians with important diagnostic and prognostic information over and above that typically obtained from a peripheral blood pressure measure (the blood pressure in the arm). Central blood pressures may be better than traditional peripheral blood pressure measures as: i) peripheral blood pressure may not accurately reflect the effects of peak arterial blood pressure on centrally located organs, ii) central blood pressures may be 50 % superior to peripheral blood pressures when predicting cardiovascular events, and iii) information pertaining to central blood pressures may be more effective in the management of hypertension. While the validity of oscillometric devices which measure central blood pressures has been demonstrated, further study is required to determine precision under normal clinical operating conditions (i.e., reflective of the Hospital/GP practice setting). As such, this study will assess central and peripheral blood pressures of stroke patients when fasted and nonfasted, and when seated and supine. The study is interested in identifying the effect of the above parameters (fasted vs. unfasted, seated vs. supine) on central and peripheral blood pressures in stroke patients.

Participants will take part in three separate assessment sessions, on three separate days, with a minimum 24 hour recovery between each session. Each assessment is expected to last 90 minutes, with a minimum of eight blood pressures being taken from the left upper arm. As such, participants will be asked to give up 4.5 hours of their time to the study.

NCT04973553,"A phase 1, single-ascending dose clinical trial will be conducted. This study will be designed to test increasing doses of multimodal exercise in successive cohorts of six participants (cumulative 3 + 3 design)[22] (Figure 1).

Maximum dose is reached when two or more participants experience DLT. DLT, dose-limiting tolerance.

The 'dose' will be defined as the ability to reach a fixed maximal level of exercise (type, duration (including session length) in the first two weeks post-stroke without experiencing dose-limiting tolerance (DLT). DLT thresholds will be based on failure to complete more than 20% of prescribed 3-day rehabilitation dose due to pain, rate of perceived exertion, fatigue, or effort required.

Rehabilitation and measurement sessions will be held at either at the Stroke or Geriatric Units at Campus Sint-Jan, Genk or at the rehabilitation unit at Sint-Barbara, Lanaken, with medical services on site. All participants will be monitored for fatigue and pain pre, during and at post-intervention daily.

NCT02540733,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) plays an important role in the occurrence of the cerebral infarction (CI). Clinical studies have demonstrated that the CI patients with DM had a poor prognosis compared with those without DM. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that patients with DM had abnormalities in cerebral vessels, nerves and functions, similar with the findings in mice models. In this study, with multi-modal MRI technologies, investigators tend to observe structural and functional changes of the brain in both DM and non-DM CI patients and assess their neural rehabilitation using clinical scales in the following 6 months. Investigators also expect to find out dynamic changes of brain structure and function, to reveal the weights of factors including brain blood vessels, nerves and function remodeling related with stroke recovery, as well as the potential mechanism in CI patients with DM."

NCT02539381,"Visual impairment can affect up to 70% of stroke survivors, but many do not have their vision adequately assessed in hospital. An unidentified visual defect can cause significant problems for recovery and quality of life. The Stroke Vision app (an application currently scaled for a 10"" Android tablet) has been developed to act as a screening tool for visual problems in stroke survivors; to help identify visual problems earlier and thereby improve rehabilitation outcomes. The app includes a suite of tests for assessing the patient's acuity, their visual fields and to aid in the identification of visual neglect / inattention. Furthermore, it includes educational information on visual stroke in order to better educate staff, patients and their carers. This study seeks to validate the novel digital assessments included in the Stroke Vision app against the current methods used for screening (clinical examination by confrontation field testing). Both screening measures will be compared with the gold standard methods for visual assessments, Octopus perimetry for fields and paper-based methods for visuospatial neglect"
NCT05298436,"The South London Stroke Register (SLSR) is an observational population based registry, combining a population incidence study of stroke events in a geographically defined area of South London and a cohort study of these patients followed up over time. The SLSR has been continually ongoing since January 1995 using the WHO ICD-10 definition of stroke. From April 2022, SLSR will use the new ICD-11 definition for case identification to establish a new prospective cohort of patients identified according to the new definition.

Follow up of the existing retrospective cohort of current patients will continue, providing data on long term outcomes of stroke through a program of regular patient interviews up to 15 years after stroke. Outcome measures include health outcomes, such as stroke mortality and recurrence, and measures of activities of daily living, quality of life and mental health (cognition, anxiety, depression).

The new data collection will include newly selected scales to best capture variation in key health domains and long term outcomes.

The change to ICD-11 is expected to lead to an increase in the incidence of stroke and a reduction in the average severity, but the effects of this change have not yet been measured in any population internationally. There is a need for a high quality population-based stroke incidence study to address this gap. Similarly, the factors determining the health of long-term stroke survivors can only be understood using a long running observational cohort study.

The overall purpose of this research is to continue and develop the SLSR data collection and analysis to address the needs of stroke patients in the 2020s. The current programme was funded to address the following objectives as part of a broader NIHR programme grant on using data to improve the lives of stroke survivors:

Understand the impact of the ICD-11 new definition of stroke
Define the outcomes and needs of long-term stroke survivors
Support stroke survivors and stakeholders with these detailed data and analyses
Describe the use of formal, informal, and social care services up to 15 years after stroke
Asses the influence of formal, informal, and social care use on stroke recovery and generate patient-level total costs up to 15 years after stroke"

NCT04747587,"After a stroke, 80% of patients have an upper limb deficit, limiting activity. Some develop a non-use: they can, but do not, use their paretic limb. Non-use is a general phenomenon applied to all situations where the patient applies unnecessary compensation. Several rehabilitation techniques are effective to counter non-use, but there is insufficient knowledge to choose the most suitable technique. Optimal control theory could help guide these choices. It assumes that the chosen coordination satisfies the constraints of the task (force, amplitude, tolerance) while reducing the cost of the movement. This study will assess non-use by anticipating the sensitivity to the constraints of force and precision deduced from the logic of optimal control. The study authors expect to observe a weakness effect: in a reaching task (i.e. when the person has to touch an object placed in front of them), lightening the paretic arm makes it possible to reduce non-use, and a precision effect: in a reaching task, non-use increases with the required spatial precision."

NCT04978480,"Acute stroke systems of care should emulate trauma systems which deliver the full range of care to all injured patients by means of organized, coordinated efforts in defined geographic areas. Just as trauma systems have proven ability to save lives of the most severely injured patients, clinicians should have a stroke system able to provide care to patients with the most severe strokes. The most severe type of acute ischemic stroke is due to proximal large vessel occlusion (LVO). Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) offers an extraordinary potential to improve the outcome of patients with LVO. Unfortunately, in part because MT is available only at advanced stroke centers, only a minority of patients with LVO are treated with MT, and there are racial, socioeconomic, and rural disparities in access to MT. Based on the success of trauma systems and our prior collaboration, the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) is planning a five-year statewide quality improvement initiative of trauma communications center (TCC) coordinated severity-based stroke triage (SBST) which aims to transform the fragmented acute stroke care system by coordinating prehospital and inter-facility emergency stroke care."

NCT02688777,"Approximately 15,000 Veterans are hospitalized for stroke each year with new cases costing an estimated $111 million for acute inpatient, $75 million for post-acute inpatient, and $88 million for follow-up care over 6 months post-stroke. Contributing to these costs is the incidence of falls. Falls are a costly complication for Veterans with stroke as they lead to an increased incidence of fractures, depression, and mortality. New strategies are needed to help Veterans post-stroke regain their ability to safely walk without increasing their risk of falling as well as readily identify those who are a fall risk. This study addresses both of these needs as it will 1) investigate a new treatment approach, backward walking training, to determine if it will decrease fall incidence in the first year post-stroke and 2) determine if backward walking speed early after a stroke can identify those that are at risk for future falls."
NCT03375762,"Stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and the main cause of incapacity. Currently, the only therapies for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients are the administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and/or endovascular treatment. Unfortunately, many patients cannot benefit from these therapies due to contraindications or evolution time. Neuroprotective therapies could not only increase the benefits of available reperfusion therapies but also provide an option for patients who are not candidates for these treatments. Remote ischemic conditioning, consisting on brief episodes of transient limb ischemia, represents a new paradigm in neuroprotection. It can be categorized in pre-, per- or postconditioning, depending on the moment of application. According to studies in coronary ischemia, remote ischemic perconditioning (RIPerC) during the ischemic event is safe, cost-effective, feasible and associated with a reduction in myocardial injury. The investigators aim to conduct a multicentre study (5 university hospitals) of pre-hospital RIPerC in AIS patients (within 8 hours of stroke onset), which would include 572 stroke code activated patients (286 would undergo RIPerC and 286 would be sham). Our hypothesis is that RIPerC would be safe and would induce endogenous neuroprotective phenomena associated with good outcomes in AIS patients whether treated with revascularization therapies or not. Moreover, the development of systemic ischemic tolerance should provide metabolomic and lipidomic signatures that would present an opportunity to find specific molecular markers (biomarkers). The main objectives will be to assess: 1) RIPerC clinical benefits in AIS, 2) whether RIPerC is safe not only in AIS but also in all cases of stroke code activation, 3) whether RIPerC is associated with a reduction in cerebral infarct size and 4) metabolomic and lipidomic signatures of the RIPerC effect."

NCT04858841,"Advance in stroke treatment have resulted in a dramatic reduction in the stroke mortality, however, the number of stroke survivors living with morbidity has increased significantly. As we know, post-stroke epilepsy has been identified as a significant clinical issue in stroke survivors and stroke is the most common cause of epilepsy in older adults and for patients aged more than 65, post-stroke epilepsy accounts for 30-50% of new-onset seizures. Our previous study documented seizures during stroke presentation and during hospitalization would worsen the overall morbidity and mortality, suggesting the importance of awareness in seizure care in acute ischemic stroke.

As current studies only focus on anti-seizure/anti-convulsion after the appearance of late-onset seizures, without the intervention of the epileptogenesis, it is important to develop a potential novel prophylactic treatment on patients with acute severe stroke to prevent from late occurrence of seizures and epilepsy.

We have previously done researches on the medications that might have potential of anti-epileptogenesis in pilocarpine-induced animal models, supporting the concept of antiepileptogenesis, giving intervention immediately following a brain insult.

The results of some earlier anecdotal reports or small studies on prophylactic use of antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy in stroke, either hemorrhagic or ischemic strokes, remain inconclusive. There still lacks a well-established case-control study on prophylaxis of post-stroke epilepsy, with the early intervention of AED therapy with potential of anti-epileptogenesis in the phase of epileptogenesis.

Based on our clinical experience, and laboratory researches, we have noted two non-conventional AEDs, levetiracetam (LEV) and perampanel (PER) with potential of anti-epileptogenesis. It is justified to evaluate if early administration of LEV or PER in patients with acute major stroke as a prophylactic therapy could hamper the development of epileptogenesis and the later post-stroke epilepsy.

We aim to conduct a randomized case-control study to evaluate if early prophylactic introduction of low dose AED therapy (LEV or PER) in patients with moderate to severe middle cerebral artery infarct, could prevent the development of post-stroke epilepsy (primary prevention)."

NCT05584605,"Large cerebral vessel occlusion is a common phenomenon in the general population and accounts for 13-35% of ischemic strokes. Chronic stenosis in the large cerebral arteries is associated with cerebral hypoperfusion, cognitive decline and an increased risk of stroke or recurrent stroke, respectively.

Even with upgrowth of surgical or endovascular interventions, mechanical reopening of the occluded vessels is often not possible. Alternative treatment opportunities include minimal-to-moderate blood pressure elevation (typically by ceasing antihypertensives) waiting for collateral circulation to develop spontaneously. Another conservative approach to increase cerebral perfusion is aerobic exercising. Physical activity has shown to lead to cerebral blood flow increase, especially in activated brain areas of healthy human and rat models. However, it is remains unknown, how physiological adaptation to physical activity expresses in persons after stroke due to large vessel occlusion. Herein, it is hypothesized that aerobic exercise facilitates the development of an extensive and functional vascular collateral network in persons with ischemic stroke and perfusion compromise."

NCT04703218,"Study context:

The literature identifies more and more research revealing olfactory disorders, with a high frequency after an acquired brain injury. So far, studies have mainly focused on post-traumatic and post-infectious olfactory disorders of the upper airways. There is scarcer data available on the olfactory disorders occurring after stroke. A recent study found 43.6% of patients with a loss of olfactory function after a stroke (2). This type of disorder can have repercussions in everyday life and endanger people, not being able to smell a burning odor or gas fumes. In addition, patients frequently describe loss of pleasure associated with these olfactory disorders (3). Tests allowing the evaluation of these difficulties exist but remain little used in clinical routine (4). These psychophysical tests allow a quantitative analysis of the olfactory capacities of subjects through various measures such as the detection threshold (T SST sub-score), discrimination (D SST sub-score) or the identification of an odor. (SST sub-score I). Some studies have shown a reduction in olfactory disturbances following specific training. Thus, Hummel et al. proposed a self-stimulation protocol to patients whose olfactory dysfunction was due to various aetiologies (post-infectious, post-traumatic or idiopathic) (5). People were to smell 4 scents twice a day for 12 weeks. The results show an improvement in the olfaction of the patients, while no change was noted in the subjects who did not perform the training. Lehrer et al. obtained similar results in patients with head trauma (CT) after 3 months of training (6). However, no study has looked at the effect of specific olfaction training in post-stroke patients. The few data available in the literature suggest that these disorders are common after stroke.

Objectives :

We propose an open, randomized controlled study, comparing the SST score between the group of patients who received olfactory training and the group who received standard rehabilitation.

Material and methods :

In the treatment of post-stroke olfactory disorders, we will suggest to patients hospitalized in SSR or followed in consultation to participate in a controlled, randomized open study.

All included patients will be assessed using the SST and the modified ASOF quality of life questionnaire (7). After randomization, patients in the treatment group will benefit from a presentation of specific olfaction training. This training consists of smelling 4 scents twice a day using scent sticks, for 12 weeks. At the end of these 12 weeks, a post-protocol evaluation including the SST, the modified ASOF quality of life questionnaire and a measurement of any side effects related to training will be offered.

Hypothesis tested:

The aim of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of a specific olfaction training protocol in patients with olfaction disorders following stroke."
NCT05408130,"Stroke is a leading cause of physical and cognitive disabilities. The most common type of stroke is ischemic (lack of blood flow to the brain due to clot blocking a blood vessel). Many people with stroke (PwS) have changes on the brain imaging called small vessel disease (SVD). This is a condition that affects tiny blood vessels supplying the brain, leading to decreased blood flow in some parts of the brain. These brain changes may hamper the recovery process after stroke, or lead to recurrent stroke and cognitive impairment. SVD is a slow process that can be seen as multiple black spots on computed tomography or white spots on magnetic resonance imaging. Current treatments to reduce the effect of SVD on PwS are to control high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol and increase physical activity. However, these approaches do not lead to a reduction in SVD.

Remote Ischemic Conditioning is a type of treatment delivered with help of a regular blood pressure machine. This does not involve any drug. A typical treatment involves the application of a blood pressure cuff followed by brief sessions of compressions and relaxation on the arm muscles much akin to blood pressure measurement but for 5 min. It leads to a transient safe state of less blood flow in arm muscles which initiates the release of molecules and signals transmitted by blood. These signals may then go on to improve blood flow in the brain. Recent animal and human studies have suggested that the use of RIC may reduce the SVD load.

A new device will be used to deliver remote ischemic conditioning therapy in a better manner. Existing devices generate the same amount of compression for all people. The pressure applied by the machine in the arm may be either more than required or less than required. The ideal compression would be one that achieves a low blood flow state in the arm at the least possible pressure. To achieve this our group is using a small light sensor to inform us. The light sensor is closely applied to the skin over the arm below the blood pressure cuff. It emits light that is absorbed by the skin and the light is then reflected. This is detected by other sensors placed together. From the reflected light the sensor can obtain information about blood flow in the skin. When the pressure increases with help of an automated machine the light sensor can detect that blood flow are reduced and this information is displayed on the computer. The information about skin blood flow will inform about the level of pressure to apply to give accurate treatment.

The new device with optical feedback will deliver RIC in PwS and SVD in a safe and reliable manner. A total of 51 patients will take part in this study. Thirty-four will get remote ischemic conditioning therapy and 17 patients will get sham-control therapy. All patients will get standard post-stroke treatment according to the Canadian Stroke Best Practices Recommendation."
NCT02511249,"While perinatal ischemic stroke is the most frequent form of childhood stroke, early determinants of outcome remain poorly understood. Two main structural biases limit the accuracy of most studies: heterogeneity of the population and short follow-up.

Perinatal ischemic stroke includes several conditions that differ in pathophysiology and timing of occurrence. Yet, it is not surprising that risk factors and outcome depend primarily on the type of stroke. Age at evaluation also plays a major role after a neonatal insult. Even though the original lesion is static and focal in perinatal stroke, its consequences grow over time within the maturing brain and affect all fields of neurodevelopment.

The objective of the AVCnn study was to delineate the determinants, clinical and imaging presentation, mechanism, and long term outcome of a category of perinatal stroke (neonatal arterial ischemic stroke: NAIS). This led to the AVCnn cohort, which now gives us the opportunity to regularly monitor a large cohort of children having suffered an NAIS."
NCT02507895,"Currently the process for stroke recovery is slow with majority of its treatments focused around physical therapy. Among the many methods employed to facilitate recovery in stroke, the use of motor imagery (MI) training may be beneficial towards stroke rehabilitation.

Our first aim is to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a novel brain-computer interface-assisted MI train program (BCI-MI) in patients with chronic ischemic stroke. This is designed as a proof-of-concept study that only require a single-session trial. If patients successfully activate the BCI-MI system without much difficulty, our second aim is to enroll patients into a 4-week training program using the BCI-MI. Both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) will be done to determine the effects of the 4-week training program. Subjects may potentially see improvements in walking gait as preliminary data from previous studies have demonstrated positive results."

NCT02491203,"Stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability worldwide and its incidence is on the rise. Importantly, loss of arm function occurs in up to 85% of stroke survivors, with a significant long-term impact on activities of daily living, leisure activities and work. The capacity for recovery following a stroke depends on several factors, including the extent of the initial neurological damage, spontaneous recovery and rehabilitation, with possible recovery even years after the stroke. Unfortunately, accessibility of much needed rehabilitation services poststroke often remains limited, both in terms of intensity and duration, as reported in a recent report on post-stroke rehabilitation services in Quebec (Richard, 2013) Recent evidence suggests that homebased telerehabilitation (TR) is a viable approach for upper limb training post-stroke when rehabilitation services are not available. Similarly, the Canadian Best Practice Recommendations for Stroke Care update for 2013 recommends home-based patient monitoring be used when frequent monitoring is needed and face-to-face visits are not available. Hence, The investigators have developed and propose to examine the use of a TR system that allows upper limb rehabilitation with ongoing off-line monitoring, to be used after usual poststroke rehabilitation is completed and services are no longer offered."

NCT02482688,"Stroke is the number one cause of disability in the United Nations with about 1 million new cases each year. Following stroke, patients with perceptual and cognitive impairments have the worst prognostic outcomes. There is evidence to suggest that perceptual and cognitive symptoms can be alleviated by multisensory integration, which has the effect of enhancing motor, perceptual and cognitive processes. This research project will investigate for the first time the functional benefits that stem from multisensory stimulation of attention in stroke patients with perceptual and cognitive impairments. The research project will involve multisensory learning paradigms with stimulus and environmental parameters that optimally enhance perceptual learning and cognitive function. Multisensory learning paradigms will be tailored for patients with stroke to determine the perceptual and cognitive symptoms that can be alleviated, and fMRI will be used to evaluate the underlying neural substrates of the effects. The project will show whether multisensory stimulation provides an effective means of attentional rehabilitation after stroke and whether the effects generalize to everyday life, with long-term outcomes that improve functional independence in patients with stroke."

NCT02454166,"Background and objective: Stroke, which means sudden onset of cerebral vascular accident. The earliest document was found in ""Neijing"". The ancient physicians had different opinions and points of view on the etiology and pathogenesis of stroke. Before the Tang and Song dynasty, the ""exopathic wind"" theory was talked about. And, after then, the ""endogenous wind"" theory was put forward. While in the Ming dynasty, Zhang Jing-Yue advocated that ""Stroke is not caused by wind etiology'', highlighting the much difference of the thinking. Until nowadays, many famous physicians have their own unique way to determine the etiologic factor based on differentiation. To be practical, objectivity differentiating and determining the etiologic factor of stroke is the foundation of establishing the treatment guidelines.

NCT02448069,"Background:

Our prior work with combination argatroban + recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (ARTSS-1: Phase IIa low-dose safety study; n=65 and ARTSS-2: Phase IIb randomized low and high-dose study; n=90), demonstrated safety of the two drugs when delivered concomitantly and recanalization rates were greater than with historical controls. Further, interim analysis of neurological outcomes at 75 patients of the randomized Phase IIb trial, demonstrated a signal of efficacy when compared to control (rt-PA alone) patients. However, rt-PA fails to reperfuse brain in most patients with large thrombi, prompting several recent randomized clinical trials which have demonstrated that intra-arterial therapy (IA) following rt-PA substantially improves outcome in patients with distal carotid or proximal middle cerebral artery occlusions. As a result, rt-PA + IA has become the new standard-of-care for many patients with large arterial occlusions such as those treated in ARTSS-1 and 2. Therefore, this study is necessary to explore the feasibility and safety of adding Argatroban in acute ischemic stroke patients who also receive rt-PA followed by IA.

Primary Objective:

To demonstrate the feasibility and safety of treating stroke patients with Argatroban who undergo usual thrombolysis care (intravenous rt-PA followed by IA).

Among these, use forced therapy (FUT), which is based on overcoming learned disuse by reintroduction of the paretic upper limb in the performance of daily activities. There are different protocols FUT to the daily time constraint, the number of days and even the type of constriction. Researchers have developed a protocol using four weeks constriction, daily constriction 24 hours and with the free end of the weekends.

NCT02399540,"Rationale: About 80% of stroke patients suffer motor impairments, but current therapies have limited effects on motor recovery. Therefore, investigating new potential therapeutic approaches is crucial. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive electrical stimulation where a weak current is applied through electrodes over the scalp. This stimulation is known to (1) induce changes in neuronal excitability -which can last up to one day with late LTP-like plasticity protocols- in a polarity and site-specific manner, and (2) facilitate motor learning and stroke recovery. However, it is unknown how the motor cortex excitability changes that follow tDCS relate to the increase in motor learning and recovery potential. The currently upheld hypothesis is that motor learning needs to be synchronized in time with electrical stimulation (paired stimulation), but recent results from our lab suggest that tDCS also increases skill learning after stimulation has ended (unpaired stimulation). If this is true, tDCS has a much larger therapeutic window and is a more valuable clinical tool than currently believed. Therefore, the investigators want to investigate how late LTP-like plasticity tDCS affects the increase in skill learning normally seen with tDCS when applied 24 hours before training. The outcome of this study can provide important guidelines on effective motor therapy during stroke rehabilitation.

Objective: Identify the effect of late LTP-like plasticity tDCS in chronic stroke patients on skill learning 24 hours later.

Study design: Double-blinded, randomized between-subjects trials. Study population: Chronic stroke patients. Main study parameters/endpoints: The main objective of the study is to determine the effect of late LTP-like plasticity tDCS on skill learning 24 hours later. As a motor learning paradigm, the investigators will use a circuit tracking task which chronic stroke patients perform better if tDCS is applied concurrently. During this task, patients have to trace a cursor over a circuit as fast and accurately as possible by moving a computer mouse. Skill will be quantified by calculating a combined speed/ accuracy score and skill improvement compared to baseline (LI; the learning index) will be compared between the sham, conventional unpaired tDCS, conventional paired tDCS groups and the late LTP-like plasticity tDCS groups."
NCT02401698,"The past 10 years of research in post stroke patients have shown certain types of rehabilitation can help neuronal plasticity of the brain. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be used to monitor this plasticity by mapping the brain's function (measuring brain activity). Recent research suggests that TMS can be used for both prognosis (determining future function) and to determine what type of rehabilitation therapy will work best after stroke. The purposes of this research study are to: 1) determine changes in cerebellar activity after motor cortical stroke 2) compare changes in recovery of motor function with changes in cerebellar - motor cortex connections; 3) determine the ability of TMS to ""predict"" functional outcome after stroke. The primary hypotheses are: 1) functional recovery will be correlated with TMS changes (as measure of motor threshold (MT), intracortical inhibition, cerebellar cerebral inhibition (CBI), motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and recruitment curves; 2) baseline TMS will predict future functional outcomes."
NCT02399904,"This study was conducted to check the effect of California tri-pull taping method on post stroke shoulder subluxation, prior to conduct a large randomized clinical trial this study was conducted, and the result of the study was promising for the treatment of shoulder subluxation."
NCT02401724,"After a stroke affecting the right side of the brain, many patients are affected by ""spatial neglect"": the damage to the brain causes them to ignore the left side of their surroundings. At its most extreme they may be unaware that they have a left side, or believe that it is moving normally when it is in fact paralysed. In milder cases, people may be unable to recognise touch on the left side if their right side is also being touched, or objects in their left visual field if something is visible to their right. Neglect alters peoples' quality of life profoundly, often renders them more dependent on others to undertake basic activities of daily living, and makes effective rehabilitation much more difficult.

The limited success of current treatment approaches indicates gaps in understanding of the underlying mechanisms of neglect and its recovery. Recent data suggest that the problems in responding to the left side are a result of an imbalance of activity in those parts of the brain responsible for deciding which side to pay attention to. It might therefore be possible to help people with neglect by ""rebalancing"" the brain either by increasing activity in the damaged side, or alternatively by reducing activity in the undamaged side. In this pilot study, the investigators will test whether they can help by doing the second of these things.

The investigators propose to conduct a pilot clinical trial to explore whether using electric currents to temporarily modify the activity of specific areas of the intact side of the brain, influences recovery from neglect, when used either alone, or in combination with a training method that has previously appeared promising as a treatment. Brain activity will be modified using a technique called ""transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)"", in which small electric currents are applied to the scalp with a wire covered in damp cotton pads. This will be done over the specific parts of the brain that are responsible for focusing attention to one side.

The investigators will compare the clinical outcomes of four interventions (1: behavioural, 2: tDCS, 3: a combination of both and 4: control).

The investigators hope that these studies will advance their understanding of what treatments may help people with neglect, and how they might work."
NCT02400138,"Weakness of the respiratory muscles demonstrated by individuals with stroke, may generate important symptoms, such as fatigue and dyspnea.

At baseline, post intervention, and four weeks after the cessation of the intervention, researchers blinded to group allocations will collect the following outcome measures: maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures, inspiratory endurance, dyspnea, walking capacity, and ocurrence of respiratory complications."
NCT02393170,"On-going rehabilitation is needed to maintain and improve the weaker upper extremity following stroke. Community rehabilitation programs for stroke individuals in the chronic stage are often difficult to be implement. Consequently, many individuals remain without structured interventional programs. Self-training programs, where individuals can independently continue to exercise at home, might answer this challenge. However, since exercising alone is boring and not motivating, individuals often stop the prescribed exercises and remain inactive. The use of video-games for self-training might answer this challenge.

Therefore, the investigators aimed to assess the feasibility of using video-games for self-training after stroke. Specifically the investigators aim to compare the (1) training time, (2) satisfaction and (3) effectiveness of a self-training program using video-games compared to a traditional self-training program."
NCT02396589,"Stroke is one of the most serious, disabling health conditions in the United States. Patients who undergo rehabilitation treatment for stroke have a high rate of disability. Poor outcomes for many persons with stroke may be low because of incomplete treatment.

NCT02398344,"Previous studies found important function of brain in exercises regulation on healthy and athlete patients and this studies showed not invasive stimulation on temporal cortex brain, induces electrics field to insula cortex, in addition modulate autonomic nervous system cognition efforts during submaximal (maximal hight frequency) and maximal exercises. Measure immediate effects of transcranial stimulation in bloodstream (tDCS) anodic on right and left temporal cortex in the cardiorespiratory parameters (functional capacity, perception of efforts and modulation of autonomic nervous system) in patients with hemiparesis due stroke. Methods and Material: It Is a clinical trial, controlled and Double blind, using 30 adult patients with stroke sequel, like roam. Evaluation will be hemodynamic measure data such as: Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, Blood Pressure, Lung Capacity Vital and assessment of the Autonomic Nervous System, before and after anodic electro stimulation from bloodstream on right and left temporal cortex region (T3 area) and cathodic position in contralateral supraorbital region to anode (Fp2). On temporal cortex will be applied of 2mA during stimulation of 20 minutes. Sham stimulation all electrodes Will be used. The stimulator turns on for 30 seconds. Results: The primary results will analyze cardiac frequency before and after tDCS and second step will assess the travelled distance on walking test for 6 minutes with and without tDCS and compare these respiratory reviews results with stroke gravity."
NCT03726047,Subjects with chronic stroke (> 6 months post-stroke) will learn a new walking pattern through distorted visual feedback. Retention of the pattern will be tested without visual feedback immediately after learning and 24 hours later. Subjects will be randomly assigned to the control group or the exercise group. The control group will simply complete the learning task. The exercise group will complete 5 minutes of exercise immediately following the first retention test to test for the effects of exercise on retention 24 hours later.
NCT02393651,"Rationale: About 80% of stroke patients suffer motor impairments, but current therapies have limited effects on motor recovery. Therefore, investigating new potential therapeutic approaches is crucial. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive electrical stimulation where a weak current is applied through electrodes over the scalp. This stimulation is known to (1) induce changes in neuronal excitability -which can last up to one day with late LTP-like plasticity protocols in a polarity and site-specific manner, and (2) facilitate motor learning and stroke recovery. So far, several pilot studies have reported beneficial results from tDCS in both subacute and chronic stroke patients, but it's still unclear how tDCS should be repeated over multiple days to optimally enhance recovery and training effects. Using a late LTP-like plasticity protocol could increase effectiveness of standard clinical care rehabilitation sessions and thus enhance the effects of rehabilitation. Therefore, the investigators want to investigate how late LTP-like plasticity tDCS affects rehabilitation in subacute stroke patients. The outcome of this study can provide important guidelines on effective motor therapy during stroke rehabilitation.

Objective: Identify the effect of late LTP-like plasticity on motor rehabilitation during the subacute phase after stroke.

Study design: Double-blinded, randomized between-subjects trials. Study population: Subacute stroke patients. Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome measure is the upper limb motor function during the subacute phase after stroke."

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and Functional electrical stimulation (FES) have been shown to improve the neuronal plasticity and motor control in few preliminary studies. Their efficacy in human stroke subjects is unproven. We planned to study their efficacy in improving the motor functions of stroke patients in a randomized trial. Sixty consecutive haemodynamically stable adult patients with first ischemic stroke within last 7-30 days were randomized into three treatment groups to receive either physiotherapy alone, or physiotherapy combined with either FES or rTMS. Outcome was assessed using Fugl Meyer assessment for physical performance of upper limb. Three groups were compared for the outcome measures using intention to treat analysis."

NCT02377804,"Stroke is the leading cause of physical disability due to the presence of spasticity. Different needling techniques, including Botulinum Toxin A are proposed for management of spasticity; however results are conflicting. The presence of spasticity in the upper extremity implies several impairments for daily life activities. No study has investigated the effects of deep dry needling inserted into the targeted spastic musculature of the shoulder region in patients who had suffered a stroke. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of the inclusion of deep dry needling into a rehabilitation program over the musculature of the shoulder region, pressure pain hyperalgesia and range of motion in individuals with chronic stroke. The investigators hypothesize that patients receiving dry needling into the spastic shoulder musculature would exhibit greater improvements in spasticity, pressure sensitivity and range of motion than those who will not receive the intervention."
NCT04455334,"This three-year study is proposed to document the effect and further implementation of error-augmented walking on gait performance and brain activities in individuals with stroke. Note that brain activations of post-stroke individuals during locomotion is a relatively unexplored realm. In the first year, study aims to observe the gait performance and brain activity of post-stroke and healthy participants when they walk on the split-belt treadmill, which inputs errors and causing adaptation during locomotion. Second year, study focuses on the long-term effect in aspect of brain activation and gait performance after training the post-stroke individuals with error-augmented treadmill walking. Lastly, study aim to investigate the long-term effect of practically applying the concept of error-augmented training strategy into clinical physical therapy.

The first-year study is a cross-sectional study to recruit post-stroke and healthy participants. Gait performance will be measured by GaitUp system and brain activity during each walking trails will be measured concurrently by functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Cadence, stride time, stride length and swing cycle are the gait parameters that will be recorded. Also, symmetry ratio and variability of temporal and spatial parameters will also be calculated. Brain area of interest in this study will be bilateral premotor cortex (PMC), supplementary motor area (SMA) and medial part of primary motor cortex (M1). Study will run one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures and, if needed, Tukey post hoc test will be used to document the within group and between group differences with p<.05.

The second year and third year study are single-blinded (assessor), randomized controlled trials. In the second year, study will recruit and randomize post-stroke participants into one of the two training groups, error-augmented treadmill training group (ETT group) and active control group (AC group). In ETT group, participants will practice split-belt treadmill walking. And participants in AC group will received traditional treadmill walking. The training duration will be 40 minutes per session, 3 sessions per week for a total of 4 weeks for every group. There will be three evaluations, chronologically, on one day before intervention, one day after completion of intervention and one month after completion of intervention. Gait performance, brain activity, dynamic gait index and sensorimotor ability of lower extremity will be documented. Two-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc test will be used to determine the training and follow-up effects with p< .05. During the third year, individuals with stroke will be recruited and randomized to one of the two group, error-augmented concept combined physical therapy group (EAPT group) and conventional physical therapy group (CPT group). Participants in the CPT group will receive thirty-minute conventional physical therapy each session. Instead of training on a split-belt treadmill, participants in EAPT group will receive fifteen-minute walking trainings that implement the error-augmented concept and another fifteen-minute conventional physical therapy each session. The training duration will be 40 minutes per session, 3 sessions per week for a total of 4 weeks for every group. The outcome measurements, and statistical analysis are the same as those described in the second year."

NCT02369328,"Stroke is the second most frequent causes of mortality in the word after cardiovascular disease and the most frequent cause of disability. The majority of strokes are ischemic (87%). Ischemic stroke may benefit from efficient therapy if the delay from stroke onset not exceeds 4H30 (intra-venous thrombolysis). In case of irreversible cerebral lesion, the long term functional recovery is largely dependent from the ability of the brain to reorganize. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging represents the most sensitive tool to diagnose stroke at the acute phase. However, up to now, no imaging tool is available to determine the time of stroke onset. Moreover, no imaging tool is available to precisely quantify the functional and structural plasticity mechanisms occurring after stroke. The main objective of the present study is to test the accuracy of sodium MRI to determine the time of stroke onset. The secondary objectives of the study are to determine the ability of non-conventional MRI techniques to quantify the degree of tissue damage and brain reorganization after stroke. Thirty patients will be included during the first 24 hours after stroke onset. Multimodal MRI (including perfusion MRI, sodium MRI, resting-state functional MRI, high resolution anatomical MRI) and clinical evaluation will be carried on at the inclusion, after 24 hours, at 3 months and at 12 months."

Patients will be randomized - subgroup 1 will undergo a 40-240 minute non-diagnostic TCD monitoring during endovascular procedure, subgroup 2 will undergo interventions without TCD monitoring.

Confirmation of our hypothesis that sonothrombolysis is able to activate endogenous fibrinolytic system during coronary angioplasty and stenting with consecutive reduction of the number and volume of brain infarcts, can lead to the increase of the safety these patients. We can presume that up to 50% of patients indicated for endovasular heart treatment can be treated using these methods in the future."

NCT02356432,"Anticoagulants are generally recognized as a necessary therapy to prevent the recurrence of ischemic stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), but in some patients they also cause bleedings, particularly intracranial hemorrhage. One of the independent predictors of intracerebral hemorrhage is the presence of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs); a high incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage is reported in patients with multiple CMBs. Recent study suggested that patients who had CMBs at baseline developed more new CMBs after 2 years (26%), compared with patients (12%) who did not have CMBs at baseline. However, there has been no study on the progression of CMBs in patients receiving so-called novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs).

This study tests the hypothesis that the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke is lower in patients receiving NOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) than in those receiving warfarin, and this difference reflects the difference in the effects of warfarin and NOACs on the progression of CMBs. Towards this goal, we enroll 200 patients with at least one CMB detected by 1.5 T MRI (T2*WI) at baseline, who treated with NOACs or warfarin for 12 months. Primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects with an increased number of CMBs at Month 12 of treatment with NOACs or warfarin. If the results of this study support the efficacy of NOACs in preventing increase of CMBs, this would be of great interest to domestic and overseas clinicians, in view of the potential therapeutic impact, including that for primary prevention of ischemic stroke."

NCT01745692,"Ischaemic strokes (those caused by blockage in an artery in the brain caused by a blood clot) can be treated with very early use of clot-busting (thrombolytic) drugs to attempt to restore the blood supply and limit the damage, resulting in an increased proportion of people making a recovery to independence after stroke. However, drug treatment only succeed in restoring blood flow in a minority of people with clots in the larger arteries (10-25% depending on the size of the blood vessel) and these people also have the most severe strokes and highest risk of death or dependence as a result of the stroke. Current best treatment is therefore least effective in the group with the most severe strokes. Devices that can be fed through the blood vessels to either remove or break up the blood clot in the brain vessels can open this type of large artery blockage. However, using these devices is a highly skilled procedure and it takes some time both to set up the necessary facilities (including anaesthetic, nurses and medical support) and to reach the blockage. The extra time that is required to use these devices may mean that brain tissue is already irreversibly damaged. If so, then an individual patient cannot benefit and indeed may be harmed by opening the artery. There are no completed clinical trials comparing the outcome in people treated with standard stroke treatment and those treated with devices. PISTE is a randomised, controlled trial to test whether additional mechanical thrombectomy device treatment improves functional outcome in patients with large artery occlusion who are given IV thrombolytic drug treatment as standard care."
NCT02339493,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most preventable cause of stroke. CHADS and CHA2DS2VASc scores predict the likelihood of stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF.

NCT02338466,"Proximal Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) occlusions constitute the most severe stroke. Intra-venous thrombolysis with rt-PA within the first 4,5 hours is the only proven effective treatment. Prognosis is closely related to the recanalization rate that reaches only 30 to 50%. A new therapeutic strategy consisting in a sequential intravenous (IV) thrombolysis by rt-PA followed by 50UI/kg of IV tenecteplase (TNK) has been proposed in case of no recanalization after rt-PA. A case series of 13 consecutive patients treated by this association has been published in 2011. A high rate of recanalization without hemorrhagic transformation increase has been reported. However, efficiency and safety of this therapeutic have to be assessed in a randomized multi-centric study. Such a study is of great interest since interventional neuroradiology has not already shown superiority regarding IV rt-PA. Moreover interventional neuroradiologists specialists are only available in major hospital and an IV sequential strategy could provide an interesting alternative.

However, outcome of lacunar infarction is excellent, about 20-40% patients are suffered neurological worsening.

Progressive lacunar infarction is associated poor functional outcome and neurological deficit.

Currently, no treatment for progressive lacunar infarction is recommended on the guideline.

Several small study reported that phenylephrine and magnesium may be helpful for progressive lacunar infarction.

Carbogen is a mixture of 5% CO2 with 95% O2. Carbogen is safe and it is used for the treatment of sudden sensory neural hearing loss or ocular ischemia.

CO2 dilate cerebral arteriole and concentration of CO2 is correlated with cerebral blood flow.

Lacunar infarction is small and perfused with marginal flow by neighboring perforating arteriole.

Increased cerebral blood flow following dilation of cerebral arteriole by CO2 might halt and revert progressive lacunar infarction.

Induced hypertension is alternative treatment of progressive lacunar infarction. Increasing blood pressure also induce cerebral blood flow.

Phenylephrine is an α1 agonist, phenylephrine act on peripheral artery and little effect on cerebral artery or heart.

NCT02881736,"Clinical assessment of motor and sensory deficits is still today largely based on tests that do not permit any precise quantification. However, robotic technologies, coupled with neuroimaging techniques constitute new tools to assess sensorimotor functions that could allow to conceive neurorehabilitation protocols better adapted to the neurological impairment of each patient and to her/his specific recovery profile.

The goal of this project is to contribute identifying the factors that determine functional recovery in stroke patients presenting upper-limb motor deficits. Here, we will focus our research on two factors that contribute in a complementary way to motor control: 1) the processing of proprioceptive informations, and 2) the processing of movement-execution errors. In this purpose, we will combine psychophysical methods that allow to precisely quantify sensorimotor deficits with functional and anatomical neuroimaging techniques. More specifically, we will exploit experimental protocols that have been developed in basic research, that use a robotic exoskeleton coupled with a virtual reality device, to precisely quantify motor and proprioceptive deficits in stroke patients. Then, we will link these behavioral data to electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded during a motor adaptation task, as well as to anatomical data, namely conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) completed by diffusion tensor images (DTI) in order to achieve a finer description of the cerebral lesions.

The present study will include two experimental parts, respectively centered on the proprioceptive deficits (Part 1) and the anomalies in the processing of movement-execution errors (Part 2).

Proprioceptive deficits in stroke patients : We will test the hypothesis that, when present, deficits in kinaesthesia and troubles in unconscious proprioception contribute substantially to motor deficits in stroke patients ; with as a corollary hypothesis, that deficits in "" proprioception for action "" are more determinant than deficits in the conscious sense of position (classically tested in clinics). In this purpose, we will collect three sets of behavioral data, in chronic stroke patients and healthy control participants, respectively intended to assess a) motor deficits, b) troubles in conscious sense of position, and c) deficits in ""proprioception for action"". To better document the neuronatomical substrates of these different types of deficits. In this purpose, we will link the obtained behavioral data with the results of detailed analyses of the lesions of the tested stroke patients.

Anomalies in the processing of movement-execution errors in stroke patients : We will assess movement-execution error processing in stroke patients, in order to test the idea that anomalies in error processing might contribute to motor deficits in stroke patients. In this purpose, we will record an electrophysiological correlate (ERP) of movement-error processing during a motor adaptation task. We will analyse the relation between the modulation of this ERP and motor performance. We will also examine the relation between these two sets of data (behavioral and electrophysiological) and the behavioral data collected during the first part of the study (Proprioceptive deficits). This will provide us with insight into the relationship between proprioceptive deficits and cinematic error processing. As in the first part of the study, we will link the observed electrophysiological and behavioral anomalies with the results of a detailed analysis of the anatomical lesions of the tested patients."

NCT04039399,"Stroke is the leading cause of disability in adults in the United States. Despite advances in hyperacute stroke care, advancements in stroke rehabilitation are lagging. We have previously shown that a non-invasive, cost-effective, easy to perform intervention, called ischemic conditioning (IC), can improve paretic leg strength, reduce muscle fatigue, and increase walking speed in chronic stroke survivors (>1 year post-stroke). The IC procedure makes the paretic leg transiently ischemic (5 minutes) using a cuff inflated to 225 mmHg, and repeats the occlusion 5 times with 5 minute periods of rest between cycles (45 total minutes). It is well accepted that the response to IC is complex and involves local, humoral and neural factors. The mechanism by which IC can confer motor benefit in stroke survivors is unknown. The aim of this study is to examine if IC can increase sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, which would promote an increased cardiovascular response to exercise and increased muscle strength. We hypothesize that plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels will increase more during a cold pressor test (a well-tolerated test to induce a sympathetic response) in chronic stroke survivors who undergo a single session of IC vs. IC-Sham. To accomplish the goals of this study, 15 chronic stroke survivors will each make two visits to the adult translational research unit at Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) to have either IC or IC-Sham performed on their paretic leg in a counterbalanced order. Venous blood will be drawn before and after the IC or IC-Sham procedure and after a two-minute cold pressor test where the study participants submerge their hand into a bucket of ice water. This will cause an increased sympathetic response, which will be assessed by measuring blood pressure and the relative increase in the levels of circulating catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine, assessed by high performance liquid chromatography)."
NCT04038697,"This innovative study will address scientific and clinical areas relatively unexplored in chronic stroke that could lead to greater recovery of walking. Ischemic Conditioning (IC) is a non-invasive, simple procedure that improves motor function, exercise performance and cardiovascular function in healthy controls, but it has never been applied to the stroke population. We postulate that IC enhances the recruitment of motoneurons and results in positive neural adaptations, improves vascular endothelial function and peripheral blood flow, and together these improvements result in an increased capacity to exercise and faster walking speed. Future studies will examine the effects of IC and traditional therapy at different time points of recovery post stroke, durability of IC, molecular mechanisms of neural and cardiovascular adaptation and the efficacy compared with other adjuncts."
NCT05392270,"If a subject agrees to participate, the primary investigators will collect some basic information including age, height, and weight. Intake of some general questions regarding health and each subject will complete some tests that measure walking speed, cognition, and balance. During these tests participants will be asked to stand from a chair, walk up & down a staircase, walk over objects in a forward, backward, and sideways directions, walk around objects in forward and backward directions. After completing those tests, participants will be asked to repeat them while doing another task such as counting out loud, naming objects, or passing an object from one hand to another.

At the end of the day, a step counter will be attached to each subject's ankle and you asked to wear it when awake for the next 7 days. Investigators expect that the evaluation will last 1 hour. After 7 days, subjects will return the step counter to the researchers and begin the exercise classes. The exercise classes will occur 2 days per week for 8 weeks. In the class participants will be asked to perform gentle exercises and use memory to improve brain functioning. Each class is expected to last 1 hour. At the conclusion of the exercise classes, investigators will again perform the gait, balance and cognitive tasks as we did before each started the class. Once a subject finishes all the exercise classes and testing, investigators will call one every week to see if you have had any falls at home. The calls will go on for 6 months."

NCT05039047,"Regaining independent gait is one of the main goals in stroke rehabilitation and early prediction of gait outcome is important to guide discharge planning at acute stroke units, design rehabilitation and inform patients and relatives. In the last decade, two easy-to-apply prediction models for gait were developed: the EPOS model in the Netherlands and the TWIST model in New Zealand. Although the models' performance in the development cohorts was good, this does not automatically mean that the models are ready for application in clinical practice, as it is unknown whether their performance is also good in an independent cohort from a different country and with different patient characteristics. Such external validation is an essential step towards clinical implementation of prediction models.

A mobility-related problem is the occurrence of falls after stroke. Walking is among the Top 3 activities during which stroke patients fall, with the other two activities being transferring or sitting in a wheelchair. Especially soft tissue injuries after a fall are common and in 1-15% of the patients, the fall results in a fracture. Apart from the costs that arise from these injuries, falls have a negative impact on the patient's physical functioning and psychological status, with an increased dependency and fear of falling, resulting in a reduced quality of life.

A systematic review found 12 studies that developed fall risk prediction models for either inpatient rehabilitation stroke patients or those living in the community. Important predictors for falls are the presence of hemi-inattention, fall history and balance deficits. However, none of the models had an acceptable performance and predictors were not always captured by a validated assessment, which is an important prerequisite for an unbiased prediction model.

The primary aim of this study is to externally validate the EPOS and TWIST models for independent gait after stroke in a heterogeneous sample of subjects admitted to the hospital with an acute stroke. It is hypothesized that the performance of both models in this independent cohort will be lower than in the development cohorts, but still be adequate.

The secondary objective is to investigate the occurrence and predictability of falls within the first six months after stroke and its relationship with the prognosis for independent gait within this sample."

NCT03115450,The purpose of this investigator-initiated study is to compare the use of pupilometer and ultrasound assessment of optic nerve sheath diameter in predicting the ICP and to see if there is a value that could be used to indicate elevated ICP with either modality as these numbers are inconsistent throughout the literature. Patients that have either an external ventricular drain (EVD) or bolt placed will be enrolled in the study. After the EVD and bolt are placed the patient will undergo pupilometer examination (standard of care) followed by ultrasound assessment of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD). The three values will be recorded. The same patient may have multiple readings performed if there is a change in ICP either spontaneously or due to intervention.
NCT03542188,"Should we prioritize thrombectomy or thrombolysis in acute stroke? Finding the answer to this question will improve treatment and outcome for stroke patients only by changing triage and transportation. And it will have implications for stroke patients around the world.

The investigators propose a national investigator-driven, multi-center, randomised single-blinded clinical trial to investigate which treatment strategy is superior in patients with acute stroke and suspected large vessel occlusion (LVO): direct transport to a comprehensive stroke center for early endovascular therapy (EVT) or to a primary stroke center for early IV thrombolysis followed by secondary transport to a comprehensive stroke center for EVT if needed.

Effective reperfusion therapy marks a new era within stroke medicine and has been driving major changes in the organization of care within the last decade. Timely thrombolysis and/or EVT in acute ischemic stroke is a key factor for improved outcome. Major stroke occur in 25% of all cases and is caused by LVO. Major strokes have approximately 60% risk of severe disability or death at three months if not treated. EVT is superior to thrombolysis in strokes caused by a LVO, but EVT is only performed in specialized centers due to the complexity of the treatment and need for skilled neurointerventionalists.

A simple stroke severity score has been developed, that can identify most patients with LVO in the pre-hospital setting. This enables selection of patients with a suspected LVO to be transported without delay directly to a comprehensive stroke center for EVT while potentially bypassing a nearer primary stroke center for IV-thrombolysis.

Study results will have major impact of future acute stroke treatment and organization."
NCT05090878,"Apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels (which encompass all atherogenic lipoproteins, including LDL), Lp(a) levels, and carotid IPH are associated with both first-ever and recurrent ischemic stroke.

While being typically benign by affecting only the epidermis, or outer layer of skin, the burn site is remaining red, dry, and very painful. As Haemoblock contains nanoparticles of silver and is known for both bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects, it likely decreases the potential for infection postoperatively. Furthermore, after fibrin replaces the superficial structure ""Hemoblock-albumin"", the polyacrylate matrix is plasmolyzed which initiates the cascade of signals required for the tissue regeneration processes. Objective of the study was to examine the effect of the Regenerative Solution ""Hemoblock"" in lowering postoperative complications in children diagnosed with Vascular Pathology undergoing a laser surgery if delivered with transdermal patches."
NCT05104645,"Stroke is the leading cause of acquired disability in adults in France, and more than 500,000 French people are currently living with the after-effects. Hemiparesis, which is a partial deficit of motor or muscular control affecting the right or left half of the body, is the most frequent motor disorder after a stroke. Currently, the management and treatment of stroke patients consists of a combination of pharmacological treatments (drugs, botulinum toxin, etc.), the fitting of devices (orthoses, etc.) and rehabilitation (physical therapy, adapted physical activity, occupational therapy, etc.). According to the French National Authority for Health, motor rehabilitation after a stroke must meet 3 criteria: early, intensive and continuous. Functional evaluations (with validated measurement scales or analysis of locomotor activities) make it possible to monitor rehabilitation and to verify that the intensity is adapted to the patient's needs. To date, technological advances have yielded numerous gait analysis devices, ranging from motion capture platforms to inertial measurement units (IMU) and the use of motion platforms with integrated sensors. Different systems embedding an IMU on the foot, for example, answer these problems of analysis of walking in real situation. The IMUs record the movements and orientation of the foot in space; the data are then processed by algorithms to recognize the walking steps and calculate the spatiotemporal locomotion parameters. Additional IMUs positioned on the body can be added to this system in order to access a more precise analysis of locomotion, in particular by calculating the movements of the various joints of the lower limb. The validation of systems integrating IMUs must be done according to a precise method widely documented by the COSMIN recommendations (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments). This project will be carried out in two stages, the first of which will evaluate the safety and psychometric properties of the spatiotemporal parameters of the IMU devices in healthy subjects. If these properties (safety, reproducibility and validity) are considered to be in conformity, the second phase will be initiated. These same parameters will be evaluated during the rehabilitation of a cohort of patients who have suffered a stroke."

NCT04652128,"In order to reduce the incidence of fractures due to osteopenia, osteoporosis, and bone mineral density in first stroke patients, the purpose of this study was to determine whether it is meaningful to administer zoledronic acid prophylactically, and to define the characteristics of the patient group that can benefit.

Subjects suitable for the selection criteria are divided into an experimental group (zoledronic acid group) and a control group (physiological saline group) in random permuted blocks. Random assignment means that a coin is thrown and assigned to the experimental group or the control group with the probability of a head or tail, and is assigned using a random number table.

The comparison-control group was designed to analyze and compare whether there is a significant effect of preventing the decrease in bone density in the group administered zoledronic acid through the double-blind experimental group and the control group.

The reason why physiological saline was selected as a reference drug was to double-blind with zoledronic acid, because it does not affect the subject's bone density and has a very low possibility of side effects, and its transparent properties are similar to that of zoledronic acid.

Subjects undergo a bone density (BMD-Spine and femur, Whole Body Composition Assessment) test using DEXA (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) through outpatient or hospitalization at the Department of Rehabilitation within one month after the onset of stroke.

Subsequently, the subject will receive a single infusion of zoledronic acid 5mg/100mL or physiological saline 100mL intravenously at the outpatient or inpatient ward depending on the group. Subsequently, the subject will receive a single infusion of zoledronic acid 5mg/100mL or physiological saline 100mL intravenously at the outpatient or inpatient ward depending on the group.

NCT05121389,"English Synopsis

I. Title of Study:

A trial of BUN/Cr-based hydration therapy to reduce stroke-in-evolution and improve short-term functional outcomes for dehydrated patients with acute ischemic stroke-version 2.

II. Indication:

We use blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/blood creatinine (Cr) ratio≧15 as a dehydration biomarker. This clinical trial aims to determine if more aggressive intravenous fluid supplement instead of present treatment would yield a better outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke and a BUN/Cr ratio≧15.

III. Phase of Development:

Phase III, randomized double-blind control trial.

IV. Study Rationale:

We have recently reported a novel finding that the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine (Cr) ratio, a marker of hydration status, was an independent predictor of early neurological deterioration among patients who had suffered acute ischemic stroke. Pilot study was then designed to determine if providing hydration therapy, specifically intravenous saline infusion, to patients with a blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio (BUN/Cr) ≥15 improves outcomes after acute ischemic stroke. The results showed that patients with a presenting BUN/Cr ≥ 15 who received saline hydration therapy experienced a better functional outcome compared with similar patients who received standard therapy.

V. Study Objectives:

Primary objective: To compare the effectiveness of BUN/Cr-based hydration therapy with standard treatment in early neurological improvement (ENI) rate at 72 hours for dehydrated subjects with acute ischemic stroke Secondary objectives: To compare the benefit of BUN/Cr-based hydration therapy with standard treatment after three months using measure of modified Rankin scale (mRS)

VI. Study Design:

Duration of Treatment: 12 hours Number of Planned Patients: 288 subjects Investigational Product: normal saline

Endpoints:

Primary endpoint: To compare the ENI rate between group at 72 hours. ENI is defined as the improvement of the NIHSS score by 2 or more points or a score of 1 or 0 at 72 hours after the onset of stroke.
Secondary endpoints: To compare the rate of favorable functional outcome at 3 months. Scores <=1 on the mRS are considered to indicate a favorable outcome.

Criteria for Evaluation

Inclusion criteria:

Statistical Methods:

The primary objective is efficacy using the binary endpoint of ENI. Descriptive statistics on continuous measurements will include means, medians, standard deviations, and ranges, while categorical data will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages. For the primary endpoint of ENI rate, the proportion of subjects with ENI response will be summarized by treatment group. The proportions of ENI will be compared between BUN/Cr-based hydration therapy (Arm A) and Standard therapy (Arm B) using two proportion Z test. The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the benefit of BUN/Cr-based hydration therapy after three months using measure of modified Rankin scale. For the secondary endpoint comparisons between groups, independent t-test will be considered.

They probably involve the consequences of the ischemic lesion and of the handicap, but also of associated vascular risk factors and more generally pre-existent medical history, or they could represent themselves a risk factor for stroke. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a particular condition in which risk factors and background of patients are similar to that observed in stroke, without any cerebral lesion and no persistent neurological deficit. The main objective of the SOMN'AIC study is to compare the prevalence of sleep disorders in stroke and in transient ischemic attack (TIA). The study hypothesis is that the prevalence of sleep disorders may be higher in stroke than in TIA patients, reflecting the consequences of the lesion and the associated handicap."
NCT03722693,"Functional electrical stimulation (FES) uses electrical currents to externally activate the nerves and finally activate the muscles responsible for the movements of interest. FES applied via transcutaneous electrodes is a common rehabilitation technique for assisting grasp in patients with central nervous system lesions. In upper extremities, FES can be used as neural-prosthesis, or as a therapeutic tool. In the former, some of the missing functionality is achieved by externally controlled electrical stimulation, wherein the latter FES provides functional exercise which is proven to lead to relearning of motor control, as well as muscle strengthening, thus aiding reestablishment of some of the functionality. Technology that will be used in this study enhances the capacity of FES through the application of multi-pad electrodes and smart protocols for rehabilitation exercises. To improve the stimulation effectiveness of conventional FES, introduced technology relies on spatio-temporal distributed stimulation over the multi-pad electrodes and a battery of predefined, field-tested protocols for rehabilitation."

NCT02626377,"Medical progress and modification of lifestyles have prolonged life expectancy, despite the development of chronic diseases. The support and care are often provided by a network of informal caregivers composed of family, friends, and neighbors. They became essential to help maintening the elderly persons to live at home. It has been demonstrated that the importance and the diversity of informal tasks may jeopardize their own physical, mental and social well-being.

The aim of the Informal Carers of Elderly Cohort is to define, through a longitudinal study of their life course, the profiles of caregivers of patients with a diagnosis of one of the following diseases: cancer (breast, prostate, colon-rectum), neuro-degenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's and similar diseases), neuro-vascular diseases (Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA)), Age-related Macular Degeneration(AMD) and heart disease (heart failure), aged ≥ 60 years old and living in Burgundy or Franche-Comte. By following the different phases of the caregiving relationship from the announcement of the diagnosis, it will be possible to assess the quality of life of caregivers and evaluate the implementation of a pragmatic social action to help informal caregivers through a randomized intervention trial nested in the cohort.

Thanks to an analytical and longitudinal definition of the profiles of informal caregivers, this study could gather precise information on their life courses and their health trajectory by identifying the consequences associated with the concept of their role of aid in care. In addition, the randomized intervention trial will explore the efficacy, in terms of quality of life, and efficiency of a social action to support the caregivers. These data will allow to identify strategies that could be used to improve the existing sources of aid and to propose new approaches to help caregivers. This study will provide the opportunity to identify the most relevant means of support and to give an impulse for new healthcare policies."

NCT02779218,"Strokes represent, in industrialized countries the leading cause of acquired motor disability in adults older than 40. Stroke is responsible for France from 150 000 to 200 000 new cases of hemiplegia each year. These patients will see their deficit to improve during the first 6 months after stroke. This recovery is largely based on brain plasticity mechanisms and the rehabilitation has as main objective to optimize these mechanisms. However, only 20% of patients hospitalized in a rehabilitation sector recover a functional upper limb. This lack of functionality is not only due to overall strength gap but also to the predominance of this gap on the extension movements of the wrist and fingers.

Meanwhile, work on brain plasticity helped develop new techniques of non-invasive brain stimulation (Non-invasive Brain Stimulation, NIBS) as the model of coupled stimulations (Paired Associative Stimulation, PAS) for modulating way over effective brain plasticity. In previous studies, the investigators have shown over a 30 minutes session lasting facilitation (60mn) and specific motor evoked potential (MEP) of the Extensor Carpi Radialis (ECR). Several studies showed an adjuvant effect when GSIN were associated with learning of a motor task. For PAS, some studies have shown a greater facilitation when the latter is associated with muscle contraction.

The motor imagery (MI) is imagining a movement without realizing it, it is based on mechanisms similar to those of the real movement. This technique also showed its effects as an adjuvant therapy in hemiplegic patients, however, they remain lower than those obtained after a motor drive. Its use in patients with no motor makes its uniqueness and strength."
NCT05124353,"Background:

Stroke is the third major cause of death and disability worldwide. It was shown that combining early reperfusion therapy (thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy) with stroke unit care and immediate rehabilitation have beneficial effects on the patient recovery and outcomes. Cerebrolysin that was proven to have s neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects in vitro and in vivo, administered in combination with endovascular therapy (EVT) could have a positive impact on the prognosis and outcome of these patients.

Objectives:

To evaluate the impact of early administration of neuroprotective drug (Cerebrolysin) in patient undergoing EVT on the outcome of patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke.

Methods:

100 patients will be recruited to the proposed study according to the inclusion criteria:

Inclusion criteria:

Acute ischemic stroke patients NIHSS>8 Qualification for mechanical thrombectomy, without previous thrombolysis. The patients will be randomized into 2 subgroups: G1(standard dose of Cerebrolysin 30ml), - G2 (No Cerebrolysin).

The patients will be randomized into 2 subgroups: G1(standard dose of Cerebrolysin 30ml), - G2 (No Cerebrolysin). Cerebrolysin will be administered immediately after randomization or at the latest during the EVT procedure and will be continued for 10 days. After the EVT all patients, depending on their clinical condition, will be hospitalized in ICU (intensive care unit) or Neurology Department, where standard treatment and monitoring will be implemented, as well as standard rehabilitation. Outcome assessments will include: the NIH Stroke Scale, modified Rankin Score, pre MRS, IQ code, Geriatric Depression Scales, MoCA.

NCT04620707,"Stroke represents one of the main causes of adult disability and will be one of the main contributors to the burden of disease in 2030. However, the healthcare systems are not able to respond to the current demand let alone its future increase. There is a need to deploy new approaches that advance current rehabilitation methods and enhance their efficiency.

One of the latest approaches used for the rehabilitation of a wide range of deficits of the nervous system is based on virtual reality (VR) applications, which combine training scenarios with dedicated interface devices. Market drivers exist for new ICT based treatment solutions. IBEC/ Eodyne Systems has developed and commercialised the Rehabilitation Gaming System (RGS), a science-based ICT solution for neurorehabilitation combining brain theory, AI, cloud computing and virtual reality and targeting motor and cognitive recovery after stroke. RGS provides a continuum of evaluations and therapeutic solutions that accompany the patient from the clinic to the therapy centre. RGS has been clinically validated showing its superiority over other products while reducing cost also through its use of standard off-the-shelf hardware and a Software as a Service model (SaaS). Commercial evaluations have shown that RGS acts as a workforce multiplier while delivering a high quality of care at clinical centres (RGS@Clinic). However, in order to achieve significant benefits in the patients' QoL, it is essential that RGS becomes an at home solution providing 24/7 monitoring and care. For this reason, this project aims at investigating the RGS acceptability and adoption model.

The findings derived from this study will contribute to establish a novel and superior neurorehabilitation paradigm that can accelerate the recovery of hemiparetic stroke patients. Besides the clinical impact, such achievement could have relevant socioeconomic impact."

NCT05135884,"In Switzerland, every year around 16'000 people suffer a stroke. Stroke represents the third most common cause of death in Switzerland and leads to impairments (e.g., motoric, cognitive, sensory) resulting in disability. People with disabilities after stroke should have access to specialised interprofessional rehabilitation settings.

During inpatient rehabilitation, 15-36% of the patients experience one or more falls. It is well known that stroke is an important risk factor for falls. On average stroke patients fall 1.77 times more than the age- and gender-matched controls over 13 months. Falling events during inpatient stroke rehabilitation result in an extension of rehabilitation stay of about eleven days. Wong et al. (2016) suspect that a reduction in the activity level due to falls, fear of falling again as well as changes in discharge conditions could be the reason for this extended length of stay. Walsh et al. (2018) demonstrate that patients who fall once within the first year after stroke cause € 8'600 and recurrent fallers € 12'700 higher healthcare costs.

Fall risk factors after stroke are well investigated. Campbell & Matthews (2010) have collected multiple factors for falls in inpatient stroke rehabilitation from 1990 to 2009 in an integrative review. A newer systematic review points out physical function, hemi-attention, and stability as the most important factors for falls in inpatient stroke rehabilitation. However, none of the included studies showed a validated prediction model with acceptable performance. Hence, further investigations regarding the impact of various valid and reliable fall risk assessments at admission in inpatient rehabilitation are needed.

The neurorehabilitation team of LUKS systematically assesses the patient's functions and activity to design patient-specific, evidence-based rehabilitation. Therefore, a population-specific fall risk model based on standardized assessments performed in the clinical routine would help to identify patients with a high risk of falling during rehabilitation without the need of implementing an existing model with a low performance.

Aim of the study The main aim of this study is to establish a multivariable prediction model for falls during inpatient rehabilitation in acute and subacute stroke patients admitted to the Clinic for Neurology and Neurorehabilitation of the Kantonsspital Luzern (LUKS) in Lucerne, Switzerland.

The secondary aim is to explore the value of the mini-BESTest as a fall predictor in a subgroup consisting of patients who are ambulatory at admission to the Clinic for Neurology and Neurorehabilitation."
NCT02856074,"The current management of ischemic stroke is based on different strategies that may be combined: intravenous thrombolysis in a stroke ICU, intravenous thrombolysis in a telemedicine procedure, endovascular thrombectomy. Given this now rich therapeutic arsenal, it seems necessary to evaluate practices in local care in the field and the impact of these on the prognosis of ischemic stroke victims. The aim of this observational study is to compare these different care practices without interfering with the choice of strategy.

NCT03522519,"Poststroke recovery mainly takes place within the first weeks to months and about 95% of the patients reach their maximum recovery 3 months after stroke onset. Poststroke rehabilitation is initiated as early as possible and aims to reduce functional consequences of stroke, allowing patients to integrate into the community. However, up to 75% of the patients remain disabled in the long term. Strikingly, about 20 to 30% of the patients show functional decline (i.e., learned-nonuse) in the long term - most often after having finished their intensive rehabilitation period - and even stroke survivors who have little or no residual disability are less physically active when compared to their age-matched peers.

Poststroke outcomes can be well predicted early after stroke. However, the deficits early after stroke and the outcomes are measured by standardized clinical tests performed in the laboratory. The drawback of these tests is that they provide information about the best possible abilities of the patients, as they are encouraged by therapists in testing situations. This so called ""capacity"" does not necessarily reflect what patients do in daily life situations (i.e., ""performance"" or ""real world use"").

With the growing interest in the patients' performance, various assessments that objectively measure activities in daily life situations have been developed in the last few years. These devices capture movement in daily life situations in a sensitive and objective way. An additional benefit is that they are less hampered by floor or ceiling effects when compared to clinical laboratory measurements (i.e., clinimetrics). Nevertheless, outcome of real world performance is hardly ever used in clinical trials aiming to determine the effectiveness of stroke rehabilitation interventions. Actually, until today, the natural course of performance remains largely unknown, as are predictors for this course. It is also unknown to which extend patients' subjective reporting of performance matches objectively measured performance. Finally, although it is believed that there is a threshold for, for example, real life use of the paretic arm and further improvement, there is no evidence as to what this threshold is in terms of clinical laboratory measurements.

The present prospective longitudinal cohort study fills in the gap regarding knowledge about the profile and predictability of two performance outcomes during the first year poststroke: engagement in physical activities and the use of the paretic upper limb. In addition, it will provide insight in how physical activity engagement and upper limb use measured by daily life assessments relate to standard clinical laboratory assessments. This knowledge is a prerequisite for the identification of patients' phenotypes and a first essential step towards the development of tailored (i.e., precision medicine), innovative rehabilitation interventions which enhance performance in terms of physical activities or upper limb use in daily life. The ultimate goal is to reduce poststroke disability and associated costs.

RE-USE is a prospective longitudinal observational cohort study of 120 first-ever stroke patients, who will be assessed 3, 10, 28, 90 and 365 days after stroke onset, as well as at discharge of the rehabilitation center."

NCT05132465,"What research question is being addressed?

Can improve the prediction of adverse outcomes be improved for people following a stroke to optimise their treatment and care?

How is it of relevance and importance to patients and public?

Following a stroke, people are at a higher risk of developing certain conditions including heart failure, another stroke and atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heart rhythm. In the proposed study, the investigators will look at factors which may increase a person's risk of such conditions following stroke. From this, the investigators will determine if risk scores for these conditions can be improved for people post-stroke. This could help doctors decide what treatments are best.

Who would be eligible?

All adults at participating hospitals who have had an ischaemic stroke (where the stroke is caused by loss of blood flow to the brain) or a transient ischaemic attack ('mini-stroke') confirmed by a stroke doctor. All patients will be asked to take part in the study, or their family members may be asked to provide advice on their behalf if the patient is unable to.

Where is the study being conducted?

At participating hospitals in England and Wales.

What will the participants undergo?

At the time of stroke, patients have a lot of information collected about their health, the investigators will copy information from patient's medical records about their health after they agree to take part in the study. Patients or their family members will also be asked to complete some additional brief questionnaires about their quality of life, wellbeing and fatigue. Some questionnaires such as for cognitive function are already collected for patients following a stroke, but where this information has not been collected, it will be collected for the study. The investigators will ask the patients if they can be contacted in 12-months to repeat the questionnaires and information collected about their health."
NCT03552354,"Intravenous thrombolysis is considered as the first choice for ischemic stroke. In the recent years, endovascular therapy is demonstrated to be effective to treat ischemic with big vessel occlusion. However, only a minority of patients can get intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular therapy due to the restricted time window and strict indications. Dual antiplatelet has been demonstrated to be effective in the patients with high risk of TIA or minor ischemic stroke (NIHSS<4). But there is still stroke progression although dual antiplatelet. The ischemic stroke patients with NIHSS > 3 has been recommended to give aspirin in most guidelines. Of those patients, mild to moderate stroke patients (3<NIHSS<10) will result in the poor outcomes if the progression occurs. In addition, large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke is prone to progress. So, we argue that the mild to moderate stroke with LAA should be give more intensive antiplatelet. In the present study, argatroban combined with antiplatelet therapy (3-5 days) is used to treat the proposed patients to investigate the safety and effectiveness."

NCT05111951,"Support for physical activity is necessary to sustain health and reduce the risk of stroke recurrence after stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Still, rehabilitation services are not available to many of those who potentially would benefit from such services largely due to barriers related to accessibility. While telehealth is a promising strategy to support physical activity, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the implementation of technology that meet the needs of people post stroke or TIA in order to foster adherence and engagement in physical activity. This project therefore seeks to improve health and reduce the risk of recurrent stroke among people post stroke or TIA by increasing the access to physical activity through telehealth.

The present project builds on experiences of telehealth-delivered physical activity in Australia where restricted access to health-care services is a longstanding problem. Collaborating researchers in Australia have developed a telehealth program (ENAbLE program) which has been designed and tested in collaboration with end users, through a series of feasibility and pilot studies. The ENAbLE program provides support for physical activity through physical exercises supervised by a physiotherapist and behavior change techniques for physical activity (i.e. individual counseling, information, recommendations, goal-setting, self-monitoring and structured follow-ups) across 6 months. The intervention is delivered to people post stroke or TIA in their own homes via video-meeting.

This study, which is conducted in Sweden, aims to evaluate if the ENAbLE program supported by a new mobile application could be delivered as intended through a pilot randomized controlled trial in order to determine the feasibility and preliminary effects in people post stroke or TIA living in urban and rural regions of Sweden."

NCT04553237,"Stroke is a significant cause of death and disability in France and internationally. The incidence of stroke increases with age, equal for both sexes. Of all strokes, 50% of cases occur in patients over 75 years of age. This advanced age leads to a high risk of mortality, long hospitalization, causing neurological sequelae in most cases.

Neurological handicap in the elderly is due to a high rate of comorbidity, reduced neuronal plasticity, nutritional status, and the short time to convert the penumbra area to ischemia.

Currently the standard treatment for the acute phase of HF is thrombolysis or thrombectomy.

The principle of thrombolysis is based on the use of a thrombolytic drug (Actylise®). It is a tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) that will cause lysis and dissolution of clots blocking the artery. Thrombolysis is recommended until 4:30 a.m. after the onset of symptoms in the absence of contraindication.

Mechanical thrombectomy consists of removing the blood clot by introducing a probe into the artery having a proximal carotid or sylvic occlusion in its M1 portion or in the vertebro-basilar territory of an indeterminate schedule of less than 24 hours or determined from 6 hours to 24 hours having a radio-clinical mismatch, according to the DAWN study. The results of this study were analyzed according to age, NIHSS score and lesion volume on perfusion scanner or MRI (RAPID software). The interim analysis at 31 months on 206 randomized patients (107 thrombectomies versus 99 medical treatments alone) showed a clear superiority of the thrombectomy, leading to the premature end of the study, over the handicap at 3 months with more than 35 % of independent patients.

In most of the randomized studies, patients over 90 years of age have been excluded or are under-represented. This lack of data therefore does not make it possible to determine the effectiveness of thrombolysis or thrombectomy treatments in these patients.

A recent meta-analysis has shown that the functional recovery in these patients treated by thrombectomy is superior to those of the same age without thrombectomies. According to American studies, the advanced age of a patient is not a contraindication to this treatment.

Patients affected by a cerebral infarction represent 40 to 50% of hospitalizations in the neurology department of the Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint-Joseph. In the intensive care of the neuro-vascular unit, the patient is received as quickly as possible to decide whether he can benefit from an extreme emergency treatment (intravenous thrombolysis or thrombectomy).

The present study should show that the clinical course after treatment in patients over 90 years of age is substantially comparable to younger patients, and that age is not a contraindication to treatment in the acute phase of stroke in the elderly."

NCT02907775,"Over 87,000 people have a first stroke in the UK each year; about 70% of victims have altered arm function and about 40% are left with a non-functional arm. Spasticity is a significant deterrent for recovery of arm function following stroke. One in four patients develop spasticity within the first 2 weeks of the stroke and by 12 months 39 % have spasticity. The use of oral antispasticity medications like baclofen and tizanidine are often restricted due to side effects like sedation, weakness and floppiness. Compliance of adults to treatment with oral anti spasticity drugs is only around 50%.

There are a few exploratory studies on sensory stimulation using Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) in reducing spasticity. Amatya et al reviewed the evidence and concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to recommend its routine use. One possible explanation for the ineffectiveness of TENS is that it uses a single channel, single strength and fixed duration stimulation to which the nervous system may get habituated. We have developed Shefstim; a unique miniaturised 64 channel electrical stimulator. Using Shefstim we pioneered a technique called Sensory Barrage Stimulation ;rapid simultaneous stimulation at multiple sites, in a constantly changing pattern. We hypothesise that this approach will significantly reduce habituation compared to single site stimulation, thus providing a better treatment for spasticity.

Objective of the proposed study is to to explore the feasibility of conducting a community based randomised cross over trial comparing SBS with TENS for post stroke upper limb the spasticity of elbow flexors to optimise the stimulation parameters through quantifying objectively the muscular response to two different stimulation protocols."

NCT04127669,"Following stroke, a recovery process is promptly initiated, which leads to a partial rehabilitation. However, a number of disabling residual symptoms may persist for years and include mental fatigue, depression, cognitive deficits, neurological problems and more. In the lack of an effective treatment these symptoms will lead to major consequences for the individual and the surrounding society. OSU6162 has in earlier clinical studies of stroke patients shown evidence of a favorable effect on residual symptoms, especially mental fatigue, together with a mild side effect profile.

In this phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-armed study, a 16 week OSU6162 treatment will be compared to an equally long placebo treatment in patients with residual symptoms following stroke."

NCT05060458,"Goal: Various studies suggest a negative association between spatial neglect and motor outcomes after stroke (Barrett & Muzaffar 2014) (Kwakkel 2014). Our goal is to assess:

The longitudinal interaction of the recovery of spatial neglect with the recovery of motor function and outcomes (such as paresis, sitting balance and standing balance)
Whether the association is different across the different subtypes of spatial neglect (visuospatial/personal/ADL-related)
The role of compensation strategies for balance control in patients with spatial neglect

To do so, we will perform a longitudinal cohort study in which we will repetitively assess post-stroke patients using a comprehensive assessment approach for both spatial neglect and motor outcomes. With regards to neglect, we will evaluate various aspects of both visuospatial and personal neglect. For motor outcomes, we will combine clinical and instrumented (biomechanical) assessment methods to evaluate post-stroke recovery of leg paresis, (sitting and standing) balance and gait."
NCT05379413,"Stroke is one of the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Post-stroke spasticity (PSS) is outbreak after a stroke and is featured by disabling muscle stiffness. PSS could manifest in up tp 50% cases within 6 months after a stroke, especially in the upper limb. Despite it is an acknowledged condition it is insufficiently recognized and treated in clinical practice.

Focal and regional spasticity could improve with rehabilitation and in selected cases with botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) type A injections. The latter causes muscle relaxation and fosters neuroplasticity, which is able in turn of ameliorating several patient functional aspects. Recent literature demonstrated that PSS patients treated with early BoNT (within 3 month since PSS outbreak) could improve in their clinical status better than patients with a later treatment.

An earlier recognition of PSS predictors could improve patient management. Hence, the investigators are going to perform a multicentric prospective observational real life study with BoNT, based on the best clinical practice and aimed at the early recognition and management of PSS through the identification of 1) early clinical predictors of spasticity (collected within 10 days since stroke), 2) BoNT clinical outcome relative to the timing of the treatment"
NCT05051397,Acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion is responsible of cerebral blood flow impairment with a progressive and extensive ischemic process. Cerebral collateral circulation may preserve an ischemic penumbra that could recover providing timely reperfusion of the occluded vessel. Mechanical thrombectomy is the standard of care for anterior circulation large vessel reperfusion. Strategy to promote cerebral blood flow in collateral circulation before reperfusion is scarce and rely mainly on blood pressure maintenance. Carbon dioxide is a potent cerebral vasodilator that could enhance collateral circulation blood flow and cerebral protection before reperfusion. General anesthesia with endotracheal mechanical ventilation could be used for thrombectomy and give the opportunity to modulate and control carbon dioxide tension in the blood. This study will test the effect of moderate hypercapnia on penumbral collateral circulation before reperfusion during mechanical thrombectomy for anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke under general anesthesia.

NCT05049018,"Postural balance control is based on complex mechanisms involving several sensory and motor systems. Maintaining postural equilibrium requires muscle activation to oppose the balance threats. Stroke may be associated with a variety of deficits, including impaired upper limb functions , poor postural stability, impaired reactive balance control, and delayed responses to external balance perturbations. Individuals with stroke are at high risk for falls in all post-stroke stages. Falls may have long-term serious consequences and can lead to more disability. Upper extremity movements have a relevant contribution in controlling balance and enhance the ankle and hip strategies for maintaining upright postural stability among healthy adults. Upper extremities movements also, constitute important elements in both equilibrium and protective reactions. Appropriate corrective responses of both the upper and lower extremities are essential to regain balance control and reduce the risk of falls. More studies are required to know about the impact of arm movements on postural balance control in individuals post-stroke. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the improvement of the upper extremity functions on postural balance control in patients with stroke."

NCT05032781,"Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in the United States. Endovascular intervention with mechanical thrombectomy has become the standard of care for acute large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke since multiple clinical trials demonstrated improved long-term clinical outcomes with treatment. However, despite high rates of successful vessel recanalization and thus reperfusion of ischemic brain tissue in current practice, many patients continue to suffer debilitating strokes and poor long-term functional outcome. Pharmacologic neuroprotection could potentially present a means of addressing this mismatch in radiologic vs. clinical outcomes by protecting and salvaging damaged brain tissue. Intra-arterial delivery of a cocktail of neuroprotective therapy at the time of endovascular reperfusion would provide immediate, targeted therapy directly to the damaged brain territory. Hypothermia, minocycline and magnesium can target multiple facets of the complex ischemic injury cascade, and have each demonstrated neuroprotection in multiple preclinical models. This is a phase I trial that aims to demonstrate safety and feasibility of administering cold saline, minocycline, and magnesium sulfate intra-arterially immediately after thrombectomy in stroke interventions."
NCT04606641,"The hemiparetic arm is one of the most undesirable consequences of stroke. Approximately 30-66% of patients with stroke are not able to gain motor function of their affected hand which prevents them from performing their daily activities for the rest of their lives. It is very important in the treatment of stroke patients to improve their upper limb function. Mirror therapy has drawn much focus on the rehabilitation of hemiplegic stroke patients in the past two decades. Mirror therapy is one of the priming technique that causes neural plasticity of the brain. In mirror therapy a mirror is placed in the mid-sagittal plane of the patient between his two arms and the patient is given instruction to move his less affected or normal limb while looking at its reflection in the mirror which will produce as the affected or paretic limb is also moving with a normal movement pattern. This will create visual stimulus on the patient's brain known as mirror visual feedback (MVF) and will cause cortical reorganization hence it will increase the motor recovery of the affected or paretic limb. A type of mirror therapy is task-based mirror therapy in which the participants are asked to perform specific motor tasks with their less affected arm. There are very few studies regarding mirror therapy combined with functional tasks. It is a randomized controlled trial study and its duration is 6 months. Total sample size will be 26; 13 participants into each group. The subjects will be divided into two groups, Group A Experimental group and Group B control group. A 20 minutes session will be performed thrice in a week for a total of 6 weeks. The experimental group will perform functional tasks with mirror therapy and the control group will perform functional tasks without mirror therapy. The Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination scale and Brunnstrom stages of motor recovery scale will be used in the inclusion criteria of patients. Outcomes of patients will be measured using Brunnstrom stages of motor recovery, Motor Assessment Scale (MAS) upper limb component, Fugl Meyer Upper Extremity Assessment Scale (FMA-UE) and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) self-care component at baseline, after every 2 weeks and with follow up at 6 weeks. After this, the data will be analyzed on the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 21 version."
NCT05026359,"The coordinated control between the bilateral ankles plays an important role in daily life functions such as walking and balance. The central nervous system damage caused by stroke, in addition to the limitation of the ankle movement on the hemiplegic side and the deterioration of the movement ability, It will seriously affect the coordinated control performance between the bilateral ankle joints, which will cause the majority of stroke patients to have barriers to walking function, and increase the patient's daily care depending on the caregiver. However, there is currently no research on stroke patients, the development of a coordinated control evaluation method with bilateral ankle joints, the use of load-bearing state simulation similar to the real-life bilateral ankle and foot coordination control performance, the establishment of clinical value of bilateral ankle Coordinating the performance parameters of the control evaluation; thus, the clinical doctors can not accurately understand the degree of defect in the bilateral foot and ankle coordination control of the stroke patients, and explore the influence of the bilateral ankle-foot coordination control defect on the daily life function of the stroke patients, and even cannot be based on the evaluation results. The clinical parameters, combined with visual feedback and bilateral rehabilitation advantages of rehabilitation training program, improve the bilateral ankle joint coordination control ability and lower limb function of stroke patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to establish an assessment system that can be used to measure the performance of bilateral ankle joint coordination control, to understand the degree of injury in bilateral ankle and foot coordination control, and to analyze the biped coordination parameters and clinical gait performance. The characteristics, and then the design of a double-sided rehabilitation training program combined with visual feedback, is used to improve the bilateral ankle joint coordination control performance and lower limb movement function of stroke patients."

NCT04979208,"The Covid-19 pandemic and its health and societal consequences raise fears of a deterioration in the management of non-Covid-19 pathologies, particularly those requiring rapid treatment. These fears relate in particular to strokes and acute myocardial infarctions (AMI), the two most frequent diseases, for which emergency treatment is a major factor in the vital and functional prognosis of patients. They are based on activity data from the emergency services, which have shown a sharp drop in admissions for AMI and strokes at the start of the pandemic. This drop is interpreted as being partly linked to a tendency for patients to delay or even give up care, which may be explained by fear of contamination, the desire not to solicit already overworked healthcare professionals and overload in emergency structures. In addition, studies have shown that the time required to treat AMI during the pandemic phase in China has been extended due to the new organizations set up in healthcare institutions in connection with this major health event. In addition, certain inequalities in access to care, already identified during the non- pandemic period among AMI and stroke patients, are likely to be accentuated by the new healthcare organizations set up during the pandemic period.

The investigators are interested in the impact of changes in healthcare utilization and reorganization within hospitals, related to the Covid-19 pandemic, on the quality of the care pathway for stroke and AMI patients in the Aquitaine region. The investigators also study the role of the socio-demographic, socio-economic and geographical characteristics of these patients as factors of inequality of access to care during this period.

The project is based on data collected within the Aquitaine Cardio-Neuro-Vascular Registries (CNV), an exhaustive cohort of stroke and AMI patients treated by a health care institution in Aquitaine. They are an excellent tool for describing the care pathway and outcomes of these patients, from the onset of symptoms to the end of the acute episode. An additional collection is planned to collect all the organizations and activities set up within the hospitals in Aquitaine. The study period, from January 2019 to August 2020, provides sufficient time before lockdown and after the date of the end of lockdown, to analyze trends in the quality of pathways, according to the various reorganizations of the health system and changes in the use of care linked to the management of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The project identifies the reorganizations with the most striking consequences on the quality of care for patients suffering from non Covid-19 pathologies. It analyzes the changes in the behaviour of patients and their family and caregivers in their use of care during the Covid-19 pandemic and their impact on the care pathways and results. It contributes to the policy of reducing inequalities in access to care and to the definition of a health strategy in the event of a major health crisis."

NCT04963114,"INTRODUCTION: After stroke, perceptual impairments, such as negative body perception, contribute to social isolation and depression. In the subacute poststroke phase, art therapy is effective in improving depression, self-esteem, and community integration. Yet, no study has explored the effectiveness of art therapy at the chronic stage of a stroke; where motor recovery is slowed, and body image and self-esteem are deeply challenged.

OBJECTIVES: Primary; to assess the feasibility of an art therapy program (ATP) in the chronic phase of stroke. Secondary; to explore the effects of ATP on perceptual impairment (body image/self-esteem), mood and community integration.

METHOD: Nine adults (stroke ≥6 months) will participate in the ATP consisting of a thematic group visit to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts followed by an art workshop, supervised by an art therapist (7 visits over 4 months). Feasibility will be evaluated by triangulating data from interviews and subject assessment questionnaires and by assessing retention and attendance. The effects of the ATP will be assessed by changes in perceptual and mood impairment questionnaires (Body Image States, Self-Esteem scales, Beck Depression Inventory-Short-Form) and community integration questionnaire (The Community Integration Questionnaire).

NCT04942795,"The superiority of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke from large vessel occlusion compared to standard medical therapy alone has been demonstrated by several randomized clinical trials and become the standard of care for these patients. A direct aspiration first pass technique (ADAPT) for the endovascular treatment of stroke using a large-bore catheter has been reported to be an effective method of achieving MT. Recent studies reported that ADAPT is as efficient and safe as stent retrievers, with a similar successful recanalization rate, but may have better functional outcomes, fewer procedure related-adverse events, and a tendency for faster revascularization compared to the stent-retriever thrombectomy.

However, navigation of a large-bore aspiration catheter is not always possible due to unsuccessful passage of the ophthalmic artery origin (""ledge effect"") or tortuous vascular anatomy. The coaxial technique comprises guiding the large-bore catheter with a smaller inner catheter and can facilitate distal access. However, there is a gap between the inner catheter and the distal tip of the large-bore outer catheter that creates a risk of damaging the vessel wall and causing dissection or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Even with this coaxial technique, it is not always possible to reach the clot site with the large-bore catheter. To decrease the gap between the two catheters, several authors have used, in place of the inner microcatheter, a compliant balloon catheter positioned and inflated at the distal tip of the large-bore catheter. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ADAPT assisted by a compliant balloon (ADAPT-AB) when ADAPT using the coaxial technique fails to reach the clot site."

NCT04932304,"Stroke is a major cause of severe cognitive and physical disability. Despite the high and increasing incidence, and large health, economic, social and personal consequences, studies designed to remedy cognitive impairments and improve rehabilitation care following stroke are lacking. A promising line of research have shown that weak electrical current (tDCS) can be a safe, cost-effective, and potent treatment when combined with other rehablitational approaches.

The underlying mechanism is assumed that tDCS facilitates neuronal signaling, improving plasticity and facilitating rehablitational outcome. But further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms at hand, and to better evaluate the potential clinical utility.

The scope for the current project is to investigate both cognitive and neuronal effects of tDCS in combination with cognitive training , with the ultimate goal to improve current rehabilitational healthcare. To achieve this we will use multimodal MRI, EEG, and a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological asessment, to describe and evaluate the effect of tDCS in rehabilitation purposes."

While t-PA and mechanical thrombectomy have been shown to decrease disability in properly selected patients, many patients are left with lifelong symptoms. There are currently limited options available for patients who are not candidates for treatment with t-PA and/or mechanical thrombectomy.

N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is an FDA approved antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent that has been used safely for many years in the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. In studies, the oral form has been shown to improve outcomes in acute ischemic stroke and has been shown to decrease the effects of ischemic brain injury in animal models. In a small human trial, it improved outcomes in patients suffering from mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). The intravenous formulation has a long safety record. It is not FDA approved for treating stroke but was reviewed by the FDA and was given an FDA IND for this study.

NCT04916210,"The overall goal of the DISCOVERY study is to better understand what factors contribute to changes in cognitive (i.e., thinking and memory) abilities in patients who experienced a stroke. The purpose of the study is to help doctors identify patients at risk for dementia (decline in memory, thinking and other mental abilities that significantly affects daily functioning) after their stroke so that future treatments may be developed to improve outcomes in stroke patients. For this study, a ""stroke"" is defined as either (1) an acute ischemic stroke (AIS, or blood clot in the brain), (2) an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH, or bleeding in the brain), (3) or an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH, or bleeding around the brain caused by an abnormal bulge in a blood vessel that bursts).

The investigators hypothesize that:

The size, type and location of the stroke play an important role in recovery of thinking and memory abilities after stroke, and pre-existing indicators of brain health further determine the extent of this recovery.
Specific stroke events occurring in individuals with underlying genetic or biological risk factors can cause further declines in brain heath, leading to changes in thinking and memory abilities after stroke.
Studying thinking and memory alongside brain imaging and blood samples in patients who have had a stroke allows for earlier identification of declining brain health and development of individualized treatment plans to improve patient outcomes in the future."

NCT04901156,"Many stroke survivors experience aphasia, a loss or impairment of language affecting the production or understanding of speech. One common type of aphasia is known as non-fluent aphasia. Patients with non-fluent aphasia have difficulty formulating grammatical sentences, often producing short word fragments despite having a good understanding of what others are trying to communicate to them. Speech language pathologists (SLPs) play a central role rehabilitating persons with aphasia and administer therapy in an attempt to improve communication skills. Despite standard therapy, approximately 50% of individuals who experience aphasia acutely continue to have language deficits more than 6 months post-stroke.

In most people, Broca's area is dominant in the left side of the brain. Following a left-sided stroke, the right-sided homologue of Broca's area (the pars triangularis), may adopt language function. Unfortunately, reorganizing language to the right side of the brain seems to be less effective than restoring function to the left hemisphere. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, can be used to suppress activity of specific regions in the right side of the brain to promote recovery of function in the perilesional area. Despite preliminary success in existing studies using rTMS in post-stroke aphasia, there is much work to be done to better understand the mechanisms underlying recovery. Responses to rTMS have been positive, yet heterogenous, which may be related to timing of treatments following stroke."

NCT04901637,"Stroke is one of the major causes of neurological disability in adults globally. Fifteen million patients suffer from stroke annually throughout the world, from which 5 million had to continue to live with a major disability. Especially in developing and non-developing countries, it contributes significantly to the mortality and morbidity.

The improvements in medical care of acute stroke, especially in a specialized stroke unit setting, reduced overall mortality of the disease. However, the general prognosis of stroke survivors did not improve accordingly, so that many survivors have to deal with different forms of disability. Following a stroke, patients usually suffer from variable degrees of disability. They require acute treatment at an inpatient setting and extensive assistance throughout their recovery at home. Most stroke survivors depend on informal caregivers, who usually is a family member (eg, spouse) providing unpaid care for the patient.Caregivers are usually unprepared and unfit for such a support after discharge. And as a result, they may experience a decline in their physical and mental health status, social life and general well-being

The current study sought to examine the musculoskeletal problems of the informal caregivers in relation with the physical condition and the degree of disability of the patient they are caring. To our knowledge this study can be considered as the first of its kind by evaluating the symptoms of the caregiver from their viewpoint and relates the level of their symptoms to the level of incapacity of the stroke patient."
NCT04898361,"Interventional closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO) associates with reduced risk of stroke recurrence in patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke as reported in the recent CLOSE and REDUCE trials. The long-term follow-up results of the RESPECT and DEFENSE-PFO trial confirmed these findings. PFO closure is therefore recommended in patient with cryptogenic ischemic stroke and PFO according to the current German interdisciplinary guidelines. It is likely that the number of PFO closure procedures will increase significantly in the near future. However, new onset atrial fibrillation (AF) appears to increase in patients following this procedure. In the REDUCE study, new onset atrial fibrillation was detected in 6.6% patients in the PFO closure group compared with 0.4% in the control group (medical treatment); 59% of these patients were diagnosed within the first two weeks following the procedure and 83% within 45 days, respectively. These results were consistent with the CLOSE study: AF was detected in 4.6% patients in the intervention group vs. 0.9% in the control group. Up until today, markers to identify and quantify the individual risk of AF onset are lacking. Furthermore, under-reporting and under-detection of AF occurrence after PFO closure is likely. This study is designed to to assess the prevalence and and identification of electrophysiological and echocardiographic parameters of new-onset AF."

NCT05595876,"Patients with a clinico-neuroradiological mismatch pattern shown on the magnetic resonance imaging/Computed Tomography in the acute phase of stroke are more likely to benefit from reperfusion, are suitable candidates for endovascular therapy, and have a better clinical prognosis.

The ASTER Trial showed similar results between stent-retrievers and contact aspiration concerning the recanalization grade in anterior circulation occlusions. However, we still observe late and futile recanalizations, secondary either to extended ischemic lesions at baseline, long-time procedures or intraprocedural complications. The First Pass Effect that is the complete/nearly complete recanalization after the first maneuver, independently on the technique used, has been strongly associated with better clinical outcomes . In a recent paper we proposed a novel approach to identify those cases that could be treated with a specific technique (stent-retriever) with higher chances to achieve a complete or nearly complete recanalization, with lower procedure times and lower complication rates. This approach is focused on the identification of a regular or irregular phenotype of the occlusion site in patients with an M1-Middle Cerebral Artery occlusion. The phenotype is defined as ""regular"" whether the profile of the occlusion is abruptly cut without any irregularity and as ""irregular"" if any irregularity of the profile of the occlusion is observed. One of the hypotheses that could explain these results could be related to the composition of the clot : a soft and less organized clot could be more easily flattened by the pulsatile flow and therefore determine a regular aspect of the occlusion. A more solid and organized clot would, on the contrary, maintain an irregular profile because it would not be flattened by the blood flow and the contrast medium could highlight the irregularities of the proximal face of the clot.

The latter could be a favorable target for the use of a stent-retriever since the interaction between a solid clot and the struts of the stent could increase the chance to retrieve the clot. Therefore, we propose this randomized controlled trial to assess the superiority of stent-retrievers compared to contact aspiration in the treatment of irregular phenotype occlusions of the M1-Middle Cerebral Artery."
NCT04895462,"Case-series and cohort studies have shown the feasibility of reperfusion therapies in patients with ischemic stroke and COVID-19, but due to the absence of a contemporary control group of non-COVID-19 patients, small sample size or lack of long-term outcome assessment, concerns regarding safety and efficacy of these treatments remain to be clarified. Taking into account its limitations, some studies documented higher rates of endovascular treatment complications such as clot fragmentation with distal embolization and vessel re-oclusion, to be more difficult to achieve recanalization after endovascular treatment, and higher rates of any intracerebral hemmorhage.

NCT04876638,"Previous work has demonstrated patients presenting with ruptured aneurysms that develop radiographic and clinical vasospasm have a higher permeability of the blood brain membrane. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) has been studied and recently implicated in both the pathogenesis of the blood brain barrier breakdown and vasogenic edema of ischemia strokes, and is suggested to be an accurate biomarker to predict the onset of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The therapeutic benefit of minocycline, an MMP9 inhibitor, has been investigated in ischemic stroke population, however its role in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm from ruptured aneurysms remains unknown. Our project has two main goals: to further confirm MMP9 has a reliable biomarker for the onset of cerebral vasospasm, and secondarily to investigate any possible therapeutic benefit that minocycline has in the vasospasm population. Vasospasm continues to be one of the major contributors of morbidity and mortality in the ruptured aneurysm population, and close monitoring of the neurologic exam during the 'vasospasm window' usually requires two weeks in the intensive care unit in most academic settings. As such, if we are better able to predict which patients are at risk of developing vasospasm based on MMP9 levels, we will be better able to anticipate the need for intervention and therefore mitigate the risk of vasospasm induced ischemic strokes, ultimately resulting in better outcomes in the ruptured aneurysm population. Further, if we are able to identify minocycline as a therapeutic agent to deter, or lessen the severity of vasospasm, we can possibly improve neurologic outcomes, decrease hospital stays, ultimately providing an improved and more cost-effective treatment strategy to our patients."

NCT03025776,"To further develop interventions, the investigators need a better understanding of which task requirements (i.e. size or weight of object, location in workspace, etc.) drive a person after stroke to use 2 hands (as opposed to 1), and how the severity of their injury impacts this relationship and compare this to reaching in age-matched healthy controls subjects. A better understanding of this relationship will promote more informed development of rehabilitative interventions. This study proposes to explore in people after stroke and healthy controls: i.) how specific functional tasks requirements relate to 1 vs. 2 handed use, and ii.) how stroke severity impacts this arm use. We are proposing to study 15 individuals more than 6 months after stroke in the CSU Motor Behavior Lab for a two x 3 hour session of task-related reaching in sitting and 33 age matched (double sample size) healthy controls.

NCT03009656,"The emergency setting for acute neurological conditions, such as stroke, is peculiar due to time pressure and limited resources for further diagnostics. Clinical skills are essential for swift and accurate bedside diagnosis and thus are the basis for early and correct treatment. This is especially evident in the context of computed tomography being the standard neuroimaging method world-wide with its limitations for detecting smaller infarcts, strokes in the posterior fossa and reduced sensitivity for stroke mimics, such as epileptic seizures or migraine aura. To date, the accuracy of clinical bedside diagnosis of stroke by neurologists verified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the emergency setting has not been studied in detail. In order to improve clinical diagnosing and future treatment it is essential to quantify the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of stroke in the emergency setting (""how good are neurologists?"") and to assesses whether there are any differences between experienced staff neurologists and junior physicians."
NCT01021033,"Background:

Stroke, also known as acute cerebrovascular attack, is the leading cause of long-term disability worldwide. Stroke survivors are often left with permanent physical and mental disabilities.
Many stroke patients receive different therapies in an attempt to improve their independence and quality of life. However, current strategies are focused on the acute stage after stroke and are of limited influence in improving stroke outcome. One of the main problems of patients who have suffered a stroke is the difficulty in using the hand on the opposite side of the affected hemisphere of the brain; to date, researchers have no successful means to improve the hand function in chronic stages of stroke.
Researchers are interested in developing a pool of individuals for further research into hand and motor function after a stroke.

Objectives:

- To perform a screening evaluation of patients referred with stroke to determine their eligibility for current and future protocols studying the effects of stroke on the nervous system and motor function.

Eligibility:

- Individuals who have experienced a single stroke on only one side of the brain that occurred at least 3 months prior to participation in the screening study. Individuals must have some residual hand motor function.

Design:

Participants in this study will be recruited from patient referrals.
Eligible participants will undergo a 4- to 5-hour screening with a medical history, physical and neurological examination, stroke evaluation, and an anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. The screening visit may be done over the course of more than one day, if needed for patient convenience or test availability.
In addition to the initial outpatient visit, subjects may remain enrolled in this study for up to 15 years and may be contacted to see if they qualify for new branch studies. Subjects may be re-examined up to once per year while they remain in this protocol to confirm ongoing eligibility. The re-examination visits will involve a neurologic evaluation and possible repeat MRI.
No clinical care will be provided under this protocol.."

NCT05616832,"Research shows that exercising at home can improve arm and hand movement after a stroke. Unfortunately, it can be hard to exercise enough to make a difference in arm and hand movement after stroke. In this study, the investigators will try to determine things that make it easy or hard for Veterans to exercise their arm and hand after a stroke. In this study, the investigators will recruit Veteran stroke survivors who have difficulty using their arm and hand after a stroke. First, the investigators will administer surveys and questionnaires to get Veteran stroke survivors' perspectives on their self-confidence, mood, sleep, and more. Then, the investigators will ask them to track their home exercise using a wearable movement tracker (like a smart watch).

NCT05612815,"The purpose of this study is to investigate whether Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS) can be used as a predictive tool during hospital admission in younger (<65 years) stroke patients, i.e. whether OCS is able to predict the level of cognitive functioning in these patients at 3- and 9-months post-stroke. Secondarily the investigators also want to examine the relationship between OCS scores and the patients' self-report regarding general level of functioning, and if there is a significant development in cognitive level over time by comparing OCS-scores at the different time points. The investigators predict that: a) Baseline OCS-score collected in the sub-acute phase during hospital admission will be helpful in predicting future level of cognitive functioning and level of general functioning: a low score at baseline will be associated with a relatively low score on the supplementary cognitive tests at 3- and 9-months post-stroke and a lower level of general functioning, and vice versa. B) Adding background information to the baseline data of the patients will improve the prediction regarding the future cognitive and general level of functioning. C) At 3- and 9-months post stroke we expect there to be a correlation between OCS-score and the patient's self-report of general functioning, where a low score on OCS will equal self-reports of low general functioning. D) The investigators expect to see significant differences in OCS-scores at different time points indicative of cognitive remission."
NCT05612776,"Consequences of stroke are manyfold but all of them are important factors on the long-term outcomes of rehabilitation, becoming an important health problem with requires health strategies with advanced age. High intensity interval training (HIIT) is an efficient training protocol used in cardiac rehabilitation programs, but owing to the inter-individual variability in physiological responses to training associated to cardiovascular diseases, the exercise dose received by each patient should be closely controlled and individualized to ensure the safety and efficiency of the exercise program. The heart rate variability (HRV) is actually being used for this purpose, as it is closely linked to de parasympathetic nervous system activation. In this way, higher scores in HRV are associated with a good cardiovascular adaptation. The objective of this protocol is to determine the effect of HIIT compared with HRV-guided training on cardiorespiratory fitness, heart rate variability, functional parameters, body composition, quality of life, inflammatory markers, cognitive function, and feasibility, safety and adherence in patients after stroke undertaking an 8-week cardiac rehabilitation program. This will be a cluster-randomized controlled protocol in which patients after stroke will be assigned to an HRV-based training group (HRV-G) or a HIIT-based training group (HIIT-G). HIIT-G will train according to a predefined training program. HRV-G training will depend on the patients' daily HRV. The peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), endothelial and work parameters, the heart rate variability, the functional parameters, the relative weight and body fat distribution, the quality of life, the inflammatory markers, the cognitive function, and the exercise adherence, feasibility and safety will be considered as the outcomes. It is expected that this HRV-guided training protocol will improve functional performance in the patients after stroke, being more safe, feasible and generating more adherence than HIIT, providing a better strategy to optimize the cardiac rehabilitation interventions."

NCT01550419,"Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in ventilated critically ill patients specially in intensive care unit (ICU). It is associated with an increased duration of mechanical ventilation, high death rates and increased healthcare costs in China. However, VAP is preventable and many practices have been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of this disease, but the morbidity is still so high. So much more methods of prevention should be needed to reduce the incidence of VAP.

Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) present anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects besides their ability to regulate cholesterol composition. So it is hypothesized that early use of statin may prevent some of the infection disease such as VAP.

Actually, Two studies have showed that statin treatment is associated with reduced risk of pneumonia. However, the relationship between statins and reduced risk of pneumonia is not consistent.

After reviewing some of the guidelines,meta analyses and system reviews, the investigator find that advanced age,immune suppression from disease or medication and specially depressed level of consciousness are the risk factors of VAP. So the investigator assumes that early use of statin may give us a favorable outcome in the patients with coma or in the patients with severe disease (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score > 15 or Glasgow coma score < 7).

In addition there is no prospective study to investigate the role of statins in VAP in the patients with ischemic stroke. The investigator hopes that this study can approve the relationship between statins and reduced risk of VAP in the patients with ischemic stroke. And it can improve the processes,outcomes and costs of critical care as well."
NCT01568957,"Community ambulation is a highly complex skill requiring the ability to adapt to increased environmental complexity and perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Deficits in dual-tasking may severely compromise the ability to participate fully in community living. Unfortunately, current rehabilitation practice for stroke fails to adequately address dual-task limitations; individuals with stroke continue to exhibit clinically significant dual-task costs on gait at discharge. As a result, many stroke survivors are living in the community with residual deficits that may increase disability in the real world and lead to falls with devastating consequences. To address this issue, the proposed study investigates the efficacy of dual-task gait training on attention allocation and locomotor performance in community-dwelling stroke survivors. Because walking in the real world often requires time-critical tasks and obstacle avoidance, the investigators will test the impact of dual-task gait training on cognitive-motor interference during walking at preferred speed and at maximal speed (Aim 1), and on locomotor control during obstacle negotiation (Aim 2). The investigators will also evaluate the effects of the intervention on community reintegration and participation (Aim 3)."

NCT02982850,"The prevalence of AF, which is tachyarrhythmia, is approximately 2% of the entire population and 5% of the population at the age of 60 or older. AF is the cause of approximately 20% of all events of ischemic stroke, and patients with AF are known to be at 6 to 10% risk of ischemic stroke per year. Patients with valvular AF are known to have a higher incidence of stroke than patients with nonvalvular AF. However, the relevant data are insufficient as large randomized studies comparing NOAC treatment with warfarin, a conventional treatment, did not include many patients with moderate and severe valvular AF.

Ischemic stroke is divided into symptomatic stroke with brain lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and silent cerebral infarct with lesions on brain MRI but without stroke symptoms. According to a brain MRI follow-up study, the incidence of silent cerebral infarct was 17.7% (254 subjects) over a period of 5 years, with 11.4% of 254 subjects reporting to have experienced symptoms. This means that the incidence of silent cerebral infarct is approximately 9 times that of symptomatic stroke. In addition, patients with a history of silent cerebral infarct are known to be approximately twice more likely to experience stroke in the future than those without a history of silent. Brain microbleed is easily detected by brain MRI and is a well-known independent predictor of intraparenchymal hemorrhage and silent cerebral infarct. The prevention of stroke by the study drug can be indirectly assessed based on the incidence of silent cerebral infarct and brain microbleed on brain MRI. Investigators tried to compare effect of dabigatran with conventional treatment in terms of prevention of stroke by comparing incidences of silent cerebral infarct and brain microbleed and symptomatic stroke using brain MRI."
NCT04704635,"Stroke is thought to cause disability immediately after stroke followed by a 3-to-6-month recovery period, after which disability levels are supposed to stabilize unless recurrent events occur.

NCT02980744,"The traditional approach to physical activity promotion in people with stroke has always emphasized activities of a moderate-to-vigorous intensity (i.e. moving enough to breathe fast and break a sweat). For many people with stroke who often have difficulty with walking, achieving that intensity of activity is difficult. The result is that people with stroke spend over 80% of their day in sedentary behaviours (too much sitting). A growing body of research shows that too much sitting has negative effects on health including larger waist circumference, unhealthy levels of blood glucose and insulin, heart disease, lower levels of functioning, and premature death.

This project tests a new approach to activity promotion that focuses on increasing light-intensity activity throughout the whole day while reducing sitting time. The new intervention is titled ""STand Up Frequently From Stroke (STUFFS)"" and is aimed at increasing self-confidence among people with stroke to sit less, stand up and walk around at frequent intervals during the day. Studies in the general population have shown that standing up and walking around frequently are beneficially associated with health indicators (lower waist circumference, lower blood fat and glucose levels). Encouraging people with stroke to reduce sitting and increase light-intensity activities appears feasible and sustainable and might be a first step to increase their daily energy expenditure."

NCT02932540,"Cerebral autoregulation is an important mechanism whereby cerebral perfusion is normally maintained at a constant level, over a relatively wide blood pressure range. It can be assessed noninvasively by the use of Trans Cranial Doppler (TCD). This means using ultrasound probes over both sides of the head to measure changes in blood flow in one of the main brain arteries (the middle cerebral artery) in response to beat to beat changes in blood pressure dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA). It is established that dCA is impaired following moderate to severe stroke, acting as a key role in the development of secondary brain damage related to brain swelling and further damage related to the low blood flow. The administration of clot busting therapy (thrombolysis), one of the main approved treatments of acute ischaemic stroke (AIS), results in recanalisation of the blocked artery in only approximately 50% of patients. Therefore, as well as attempts to treat major vessel blockage, improving brain blood flow, particularly to the penumbral area, through arteries that bypass the blockage is another potential therapeutic approach in AIS.One simple way of achieving this might be to lower the head of AIS patient into a lying flat (0⁰) position. However, to date, there have been very few studies exploring this. This research will use the noninvasive technique of Trans Cranial Doppler (TCD) to see how blood flow changes in different head positions, both in healthy volunteers and AIS patient. This study will provide important data regarding blood pressure management in acute stroke, an important and common clinical dilemma."

NCT02910427,"Cerebrovascular disease is the second leading cause of death in Taiwan. Although stroke incidence and mortality decline steadily in Taiwan, its impact on medical cost, quality of life and neurological deficits remains extraordinary. Stroke incidence and mortality are also rising in the developed countries presumably due to a world-wide increase in prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Negative associations have been observed between high blood pressure, hyperglycemia and two major dietary cations in vegetables and dairy products: potassium and magnesium. Mean levels of dietary potassium and magnesium intake in Taiwan are much lower than those of dietary reference intake. Short term supplementation studies have demonstrated their effects in reducing blood pressure and degree of insulin resistance. However, long-term studies on cardiovascular events are lacking. Our previous long-term intervention trial in elderly veteran home showed a 41% reduction in cardiovascular mortality by simply switching regular cooking salt to potassium-enriched salt in kitchens. The investigators have previously observed an annual reduction of medical cost around $ 15,000 NT in the aforementioned veteran home trial. A multi-centered randomized controlled trial was carried out with three arms: (1) regular salt (Na salt), (2) potassium-enriched salt (K salt), and (3) potassium and magnesium-enriched salt (K/Mg salt).

NCT04794673,"In China, stroke is among the highest morbidity and mortality, especially in senile population. Most of those patients had survived with various degrees of cerebral dysfunction; among them about 50% were motor deficit. Previous in vitro studies indicated that recovery of motor function after stroke were related not only to axonal regeneration or synapse reformation, but also functional reorganization of adjacent areas and other functional associated areas. The previous fMRI studies shown that the cerebral motor cortex possess the natural ability of self compensation and self reorganization in the situation of brain damage. It was characterized by equally bilateral activation in acute stage to partial ipsilateral activation and major contralateral activation in subacute stage to contralateral activation in chronic stage.

We plan to recruit first-episode acute cerebral infarction patients with single lesion on middle cerebral artery supply area and age and sex matched healthy volunteers. All the patients are going to assess in three different sessions (V1, 3 days after the onset of complaint, V2,30 days after onset of complaint; V3, 90 days after onset of the complaint ) with both clinical check as well as fMRI scan. The clinical assessment including dynamometer and finger tapping test to evaluate the strength and the flexibility of each upper legs and it also included the corresponding scales to exclude poststroke dementia and moderate and serious poststroke depression. The fMRI is scanned by using bilateral arm motor tasks. Motor cortex activation regions, activation of voxel between healthy controls and patients in different checkpoint are collected.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the dynamic process of motor cortical functional reorganization after cerebral stoke using functional magnetic resonance imaging combined with the behavior assessment. Meanwhile，we also studied the differences of motor function recovery and motor cortex compensation between dominant hemisphere and non-dominant hemisphere after stroke. Therefore, we could provide a theoretical basis and build up a useful evaluation system for rehabilitation after stroke and other arious cerebral injury."

NCT02822144,"In France, the annual incidence rate of acute ischaemic stroke is around 150 000 patients, 65 % of whom keep long-term disability. Several multicentric randomized controlled trials have shown the benefit of a mechanical thrombectomy in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke on functional disability, compared to a medical treatment alone (thrombolysis).

The timeliness of revascularisation is an essential factor of good prognosis. This intra-arterial treatment, associated with thrombolysis if applicable, is the reference treatment of large-vessel occlusion. The stillness of the patient is required to control the safety of the recanalization. Currently, either a general anesthesia or a sedation can be performed.

NCT02778321,"Cerebral infarction (CI) can be linked to atherosclerosis of large vessels, occlusion of small vessels intracerebral (gaps), a cardioembolic disease or other rare causes. However, up to 40% of CI remains unexplained after a thorough diagnostic workup. They are called cryptogenic IC.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the cause of 25% of the CI but it is recognized that episodes of paroxysmal AF, asymptomatic and unnoticed, may be responsible for a portion of the IC cryptogenic pace. Recognition of these episodes is of great importance since they have the same risk embolic the FA continues [1, 2] and motivate anticoagulant therapy startup.

Several recording techniques heart rate were evaluated after the IC for detecting the AF. Their profitability increases with the duration of the recording: about 3% for a typical 24-hour Holter, the AF detection rate increases to 6% for a 7-day surveillance period, to 12-23% for 30 days and 17-26% with implantable recorders long.

Otherwise brief rhythmic heart abnormalities can be detected with the waning of an CI without the significance of these episodes is known.

NCT05474105,"Stroke is a significant cause of morbidity and disability worldwide. As the population ages, the economic impact of stroke is becoming substantial. In the United Kingdom, the stroke estimated cost is £26 billion a year. A stroke occurs every 5 minutes, which is >100,000 strokes in the United Kingdom each year. The current treatments available are very limited and 80% of acute stroke patients suffer from persistent impaired activities of daily living (ADL) and compromised quality of life (QoL).The brain function recovery involves creating new neural connections. This neuroplasticity could be supported by specific interventions. This study aims to explore a new approach which endeavours to support the restoration of lost function. Previous pre-clinical work from the investigator's research group and others on different models of acquired brain injury, e.g. traumatic brain injury and ischemic stroke showed that an intervention with a specialised multi-nutrient medical food, could improve neurological recovery and protect the nervous tissue after injury. This has led to the design of the present proposal for a feasibility study using this oral nutritional supplement in ischaemic stroke. The investigators aim to recruit adult inpatients, suffering from acute ischemic stroke, divided into two groups. One group receives standard National Health Service (NHS) care + a daily oral nutritional supplement (ONS), while the other group (control group) will be given standard NHS care. The investigators will explore various outcomes, including changes in activities of daily living (ADL), quality of life (QoL), fatigue, cognition, malnutrition, nutrient status and plasma biomarkers relevant to stroke. The primary aim of this pilot study will be to assess the feasibility of this type of intervention in stroke patients, so that the investigators can subsequently plan a large trial, with a series of focused outcomes which will be informed by this pilot trial."
NCT04259424,"The purpose of this project is to establish initial feasibility and tolerability of a combined aerobic exercise (AEx) and upper extremity motor practice intervention on upper extremity (UE) function in chronic stroke survivors. This novel intervention pairs AEx with a virtual reality-based upper extremity rehabilitation game, Duck Duck Punch (DDP). AEx has been shown to improve overall brain function and promote a healthy brain environment; thus it may serve as an effective 'primer' and enhance the effects of DDP. Movement-based priming for rehabilitation involves performing movement or exercise before, or simultaneous to, an intervention with the goal of improving the effectiveness of the intervention. AEx combined with UE rehabilitation can improve UE function and self-reported health status in chronic stroke survivors. However, gaps remain regarding the clinical applicability of an AEx priming session and the mechanisms contributing to changes in UE functions in response to AEx-primed UE rehabilitation. Therefore, the aim of this project is to: 1) demonstrate the feasibility of pairing AEx + DDP in stroke survivors; 2) quantify the magnitude of the effect of the AEx + DDP intervention on UE function; 3) examine relationship of biomarkers of the nervous system and response to AEx + DDP."

NCT04502264,"Over fifty percent of stroke patients experience chronic arm hand performance problems, compromising independence in daily life activities and quality of life. Traditionally, the effectiveness of rehabilitation in improving functioning for stroke patients more than 6 months has not been proven. However, spontaneous neurological recovery reaches the plateau at 3~6 months later.

Hand of Hope is a virtual reality (VR)-based, electromyography (EMG)-driven, and task-oriented hand robot. Otherwise, it needs patients to have active participation during the intervention which is critical for motor recovery after stroke. Robotic rehabilitation devices have the potential to deliver high-intensity, reproducible therapy. Robot-assisted task-oriented training had been proposed by several researchers, but the evidence of clinical effectiveness in highly functional chronic stroke patients is still lack.

Spasticity is a common disorder which occurs following stroke. The prevalence of post-stroke spasticity can be as high as 46% in the chronic phase (over 3 months). Spasticity impacted activities of daily living, quality of life, pain, and functional impairments. Long-term spasticity may lead to tendon contracture and limb deformities. Botulinum toxin injection, which mostly used in chronic phase (over 6 months), had been proved to be a safe agent representing the gold standard treatment for focal spasticity, while avoiding systemic effects. But the effects of botulism toxin on functional ability are still unclear. Moreover, there is insufficient evidence on adjunctive therapies following botulism toxin.

The purpose of the present study is to examine the effects of botulinum toxin injection combined with Hand of Hope and standard occupational therapy on upper extremity function, and compares the findings to those of amount-matched chronic stroke survivors who received only Botulinum toxin injection and standard occupational therapy."

NCT05547217,"Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability worldwide. Often, severe neurological deficits occur after a stroke and roughly 70% of all stroke survivors have some form of hand function disability. To improve the lives of those with hand function disability, IRegained Inc. has created the MyHandTM System. The MyHandTM System is a smart-mechatronic device programmed with proprietary hand function training regiments (protocols) based on deep research in neuroplasticity. It provides a highly unique and targeted approach to hand function rehabilitation with the help of the aforementioned protocols delivered with gamified training techniques. The gamified format of the protocols allows for better patient engagement, thus allowing for more effective and efficient therapy. Individuals who have sustained a stroke 5 months or earlier (considered to be chronic stroke survivors) will be eligible to participate in this study. Participants will undergo a 2-hour training session, 2-3 days per week, over 12 weeks, for a total of 30 sessions. Hand function therapy will be administered in a specific and gamified manner to enhance rehabilitation of the hand and provide participants with greater opportunity to regain hand function over the course of the study.

NCT05544422,"Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the world after coronary heart disease and cancer. In recent years, by controlling the risk factors of stroke, its incidence has decreased by 30% and the mortality rate due to this disease has decreased by 14%. However, it is still among the most important diseases that cause disability in adults.

The aging of the world population and the increase in the number of individuals with chronic diseases, including stroke, increase the need for rehabilitation services rapidly. Access to rehabilitation services is restricted due to the insufficient number of specialist health personnel and the difficulty of transportation for people living in rural areas. At the same time, barriers such as decrease in physical mobility, increase in bothersome symptoms and travel restrictions in developed countries are expected to increase with the aging population and will cause a decrease in participation in rehabilitation. In this context, telerehabilitation shows a promising way to increase rehabilitation access with fewer healthcare professionals or to help maintain positive outcomes following rehabilitation.

Telerehabilitation, which is among the telehealth possibilities, is defined as the use of information and communication technologies to provide clinical rehabilitation services remotely. These technologies allow communication between healthcare personnel and patients, as well as the transmission of imaging and other healthcare data from one place to another. Telerehabilitation includes clinical rehabilitation services focused on evaluation, diagnosis and treatment (Janet vd.,). Tele-assessment, which is among the service delivery model of telerehabilitation, is defined as the transfer of patient data to the healthcare professional or team, instantly or retrospectively, through equipment, sensors, questionnaires and tests. Unlike other services, there are factors that make tele-assessment difficult. It is necessary to ensure that patient performance is correctly evaluated. Internet and video transmission can affect the ability to accurately assess patient performance and thus affect the tele-assessment. Consideration should be given to the validation of tele-assessment for certain assessments that are frequently used in the assessment of patient performance. For this reason, we chose to examine the timed 'Up & Go'(TUG) test and '30second Chair-Stand Test' (30s-CST), which are the most common tests in the evaluation of lower extremity muscle strength, balance, and mobility in rehabilitation.

TUG and 30s-CST are simple clinical outcome measures commonly used to assess functional performance. Johansen et al. found that the TUG test and 30s-CST in stroke patients had excellent internal and inter-research reliability when administered face-to-face. This study is based on studies showing that the application of tests that are effective in the evaluation of functional performance with the tele-assessment method is an effective method."

NCT04373993,"The ultimate objective is to improve the efficacy of prehospital procedures for patients suffering an acute stroke. Increased precision in prehospital selection and a more efficient transport chain will lead to an even more rapid start of treatment and thus benefit patients. The research project has two parts: one part collecting data from medical reports and one study with qualitative in-depth interviews. The project will gather data from various parts of Norway and from a University hospital in Switzerland for comparison between regions and countries. Data will be retrieved through intrahospital and prehospital medical records from various parts of Norway (Nordland Hospital, Akershus University Hospital and Helgeland Hospital) and from Basel University hospital in Switzerland. Knowledge of factors associated with delays will be compared for regions in the north and south of Norway, as well as abroad. The information obtained will be analysed to identify components in the chain that may be improved as concerns time saving."
NCT04875936,"The overall goal of this project is to advance a biologically-based approach to treatment of reading disorders after stroke, which will expand the limits of cognitive rehabilitation. Using a novel brain imaging technique, called real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback combined with right hand motor imagery, this project will re-instate brain activity in the left language-dominant hemisphere. Stroke patients will practice modulating their own brain activity using fMRI neurofeedback signal and will select the most effective mental strategies that help them maintain brain activation patterns associated with better reading recovery."
NCT05591196,"The recovery from a stroke is often incomplete. It is the leading cause of acquired permanent disability in the adult population. Persistent functional loss of the hand and arm contributes significantly to disability. However, the current standard of care to treat hand and arm movements are inadequate. There is an urgent need for innovative and effective therapies for recovery of the upper limb after stroke.

Growing evidence shows that electrical spinal cord stimulation, combined with activity-dependent rehabilitation, enables voluntary movement of paralyzed muscles in some neurologic disorders, such as spinal cord injury. The investigators hypothesize that spinal networks that lost control after stroke can be activated by non-invasive electrical stimulation of the spinal cord to improve functional recovery.

The aims of the study are:

to determine the improvements in hand and arm function that result from the combined application of non-invasive spinal stimulation and activity-based rehabilitation. Surface electrodes placed over the skin of the neck will be used for non-invasive electrical stimulation of the spinal cord. Functional task practice will be used for activity-dependent rehabilitation,
to evaluate long-lasting benefits to hand and arm function that persist beyond the period of spinal stimulation."
NCT05534295,"Ischemic stroke or cerebral infarction (CI) is an immediate emergency affecting approximately 100,000 - 150,000 patients each year in France and is managed in the neurovascular intensive care unit (NICU). Recanalization treatments can prevent disability, but patients must be carefully selected. Knowledge in this field is evolving rapidly, which tends to make management more complex and personalized. In addition, the permanence of thrombolysis channels involves neurologists of all expertise. Decision support tools are desirable to enable precision medicine in stroke. Strokecopilot is a web application developed by the principal investigator. Its algorithm contextualizes the patient in a set of evidence-based medicine references (recommendations and clinical trials) and gives the result of their cross-referencing to the user to indicate theoretical indications for intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy."

NCT05527262,"The evidence supporting routine provision of high-dose, high-intensity upper limb neurorehabilitation treatment for stroke survivors beyond the first few months after stroke is limited. The Queen Square Upper Limb (QSUL) programme provides 90 hours of upper limb neurorehabilitation over 3-weeks to chronic stroke survivors. The recently published service evaluation demonstrated encouragingly large, clinically meaningful effects at the level of activity and body function. An alternative way to deliver high doses of effective therapy is through technological developments, e.g. immersive interactive gaming environments such as the MindPod Dolphin programme.

The intention of this study is to provide stronger level evidence for intensive upper limb rehabilitation by conducting a randomised controlled trial of two different types of upper limb training compared to usual care. Patients considered suitable for the QSUL programme will be randomised to either: Group 1- intensive upper limb rehabilitation programme (QSUL); Group 2- MindPod programme; Group 3-wait-list control (who will be offered the treatment after the waiting list is complete).

The first aim of the study is to compare the effect of each type of high-dose, high-intensity upper limb training to usual care using measures of upper limb impairment and activity levels 3 months after treatment is complete.

The secondary aims are to comply with recent recommended by the Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Roundtable, and (i) investigate the effects of upper limb neurorehabilitation on kinematics of upper limb movement (using a KINARM exoskeleton), and (ii) use neuroimaging (MRI and EEG) and neurophysiological (TMS) measures to determine the characteristics of stroke survivors who are most likely to benefit from this treatment approach.

The results from this work will (i) help determine the impact of two methods of high dose, high intensity upper limb training in chronic stroke patients; (ii) identify whether there are any predictors of treatment response that will help stratify patients in future clinical trials of upper limb neurorehabilitation."

NCT05520489,"Stroke is a major cause of disability in worldwide, causing billions of euros direct and indirect costs to the community. Upper limb motor dysfunction is seen in about 50% stroke survivors. Upper extremity paresis is identified as a strong component for performing activities of daily living (ADL) (Veerbeek 2011). Upper-limb rehabilitation is crucial during the first three to six months since the onset of stroke because the motor and ADL-performance recovery of stroke survivors declines afterward (Kwakkel & Kollen, 2013, Wade et al., 1983). The main advantages of using robot-assisted therapy are to deliver high-dosage and high-intensity training (Sivan et al., 2011). Robot-assisted training enables a greater number of repetitive tasks to be practised in a consistent and controllable manner. A dose of greater than 20 h of repetitive task training improves upper limb motor recovery following a stroke (Pollock 2014) and, therefore, robot-assisted training has the potential to improve arm motor recovery after stroke.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is the field of interest and is incorporated to stroke rehabilitation in many institutes. Low-frequency rTMS to the unaffected hemisphere could normalize the inhibitory imbalance between hemispheres (Adeyemo et al., 2012). The safety and application guidelines of transcranial magnetic stimulation were extensively reviewed by Rossi et al. (2009). It is opposed that there is no effect of rTMS alone on upper extremity (UE) disabilities, but rTMS in combination with another rehabilitation treatment potentiates the effect of the rehabilitation treatment alone with regards to UE impairment. There is inconclusive evidence that the combined treatment (rTMS + conventional rehabilitation) have effect on UE disabilities. Treatment effects have been described in acute, subacute and chronic stroke patients, though it is proposed, that there is lack of late subacute phase rTMS studies that used FMA for outcome measure (van Lieshout, 2019).

In this single-case study the investigators compare different rehabilitation modules - self exercising (baseline), robot assisted training, rTMS and intensive motor training guided by therapist, to improve the use of paretic hand. The aim of this study is to show if there is clinically relevant improvement of the motion or function of upper extremity in different treatment strategies and if any of these treatment is superior to self-training."

NCT01938690,"Approximately two thirds of stroke survivors have profoundly impaired function of the upper limb. Currently the main stay of the treatment for upper limb motor function is rehabilitation therapy focusing on repetitive and skillful task practice (task-oriented therapy) which has been shown to induce substantial functional reorganization in the undamaged motor cortex and functional recovery. In spite of rehabilitation therapy, functional recovery of arm and hand function is limited to one third of stroke survivors and there is a great need for adjunct treatment to current practice. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive means of stimulating nerve cells in superficial areas of the brain and emerging as a novel method of modulating cortical excitability and promoting functional recovery after stroke. There have been studies using rTMS to improve motor function after stroke. However, whether 1Hz rTMS can enhance the effect of the task-oriented therapy on upper limb function after stroke has not been investigated. In this pilot proposal, we intend to investigate the feasibility of 1Hz rTMS on unaffected hemisphere as an adjunct to task-oriented therapy to improve upper limb motor function among stroke patients. The information obtained from this pilot study will provide a platform for the future randomized control trials combining the rTMS and task-oriented therapy to enhance motor recovery among stroke survivors."

NCT05512910,"This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, evaluator-blinded, single center, proof of concept trial to explore possible beneficial effect of minocycline on acute ischemic stroke (AIS) undergoing endovascular treatment due to basilar artery occlusion (BAO). Minocycline has excellent safety profiles, have been previously demonstrated individually to reduce infarction in animal models of stroke, and have potentially mechanisms of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and protection of blood-brain barrier. However, it is not known whether minocycline can reduce futile recanalization of endovascular treatment, and improve the outcome of patients with AIS due to BAO. Eligible and willing subjects will be randomly assigned to the treatment group or the control group. The treatment group will receive 200 mg oral minocycline within three hours prior to successful reperfusion, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours times for a total of 5 days. Both groups will receive endovascular thrombectomy and standard medical. The treatment with minocycline will start as soon as possible after diagnosis of stroke. Measures of stroke severity and disability will be recorded at baseline and through the follow-up periods (90 days).

NCT05511467,"After a stroke, plasticity occurs in the brain from microscopic to network level with positive but also negative consequences for functional recovery. Why post-stroke plasticity takes a beneficial or a maladaptive direction is still incompletely understood. Because the biological mechanisms underlying sensorimotor learning parallel those observed during recovery, learning mechanisms could be potential modifiers of post-stroke neuroplasticity and have a discrete mal-/adaptive impact on the recovery of sensorimotor function. This project seeks to further the understanding of the link between brain circuits that control the integration of new information during procedural learning in the injured brain and those circuits that are involved in adaptive plastic changes during recovery of sensorimotor function post-stroke. The project's methodological approach will allow the characterization of procedural learning-related neural network dynamics based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in human volunteers with and without neurologically impairment post-stroke. Through multivariate integration of behavioral and biological descriptors of sensorimotor recovery, the project will investigate the association between motor learning-related network dynamics and descriptors of recovery."

NCT05501275,"Despite numerous advances in diagnosing procedures, treatment and prevention, stroke is considered a significant cause of long-term disability in the adult population Quality of life, which is deteriorated in patients after stroke (CVA), especially in the first years after stroke, is not only affected by the disease but is closely related to dignity and the satisfaction of human needs, including educational needs.

The term ""Health-Related Quality of Life"" (HRQoL) is used in the scientific literature as a criterion of change for medical purposes. It is an indicator of health service needs and a way to evaluate health status in a very efficient way. Psychoeducation can be applied in medical and nursing practice, as an intervention that can improve and/or maintain the quality of life, especially if it is provided to patients without a significant cognitive deficit. Psychoeducational programmes can be defined as didactic-therapeutic interventions that serve to provide information about the disease, emotional and social support and, last but not least, facilitate adaptation to new life situations."
NCT05500144,"Approximately a quarter of stroke survivors are of working age, and it is well-known that disabilities caused by stroke can lead to difficulties returning to work. In addition to the economic cost, being out of the workplace due to disability has major psychosocial costs for the individual, causing reduced sense of purpose, quality of life, and standard of living. Communication problems (which can affect reading and writing, as well as producing and understanding speech) are not as visible as other stroke-related problems such as a weak arm or difficulties walking. However, they can cause major problems for returning to work because of the importance of communication across a vast range of work activities, for example as a means to engage with colleagues, to share information in order to solve problems and resolve conflicts, and as a means to ensure health and safety. There has been little research into the effects of communication problems on returning to work after a stroke, so the investigators want to explore this issue. Specifically, the investigators want to find out what helps and what hinders people with communication disorders following a stroke when they attempt to return to work; what information and support is most helpful to them; how this information and support should be given and by whom. The investigators aim to do this by interviewing people across NHS Grampian who have the experience of attempting to return to work with post-stroke communication problems. The investigators will then look at all the interviews together and find the common feelings or experiences that the participants mentioned. The findings will be written up and shared widely with professionals and with stroke survivors. The knowledge gained will help the investigators to plan a programme to help people with these problems to return to work."

NCT02159287,"Patients with Atrial fibrillation (AF) make a unique group of ischemic stroke, mostly caused by emboli from the left atrial appendage. Oral anticoagulation (Warfarin) is recommended for prevention of recurrent embolic stroke but it takes several days to reach a therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR : 2.5) so bridging therapy with a short acting intravenous anticoagulant is recommended until therapeutic INR level is reached. A common strategy is to use intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) until a standard activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is reached and then initiating warfarin. Another strategy is to use subcutaneous (SQ) injection of a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) eg. Enoxaparin.

The investigators will compare LMWH and UFH, focusing on risk of new stroke and mortality rate.

METHOD: This study is randomized controlled trial that will be performed in 80 patients ages between 18 and 75 with confirmed acute ischemic stroke purely due to AF who will be hospitalized in Shiraz Medical University affiliated teaching hospitals. Patients will be randomly assigned in two groups. A brain CT will be done to confirm the absence of intracranial hemorrhage and to assess the size of cerebral ischemia.

First group will receive 1 mg of enoxaparin (Clexane, Sanofi, Paris) per kilogram of body weight SQ every 12 hour with warfarin 5mg orally everyday and both drugs will be continued until the target INR level (2.5) is reached then clexane will be discontinued.

The second group will receive continuous UFH infusion 1000 unit per hour and then the dose will be adjusted to maintain a therapeutic aPTT (two times to baseline) level then warfarin will be started (5 mg everyday).

The investigators will follow patients in both groups until target INR will be achieved (2.5) and after that clexane and UFH will be discontinued. Adverse events will be assessed in both groups for three months.

Data will be analyzed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 15 and Chi-square statistics.

Main outcome of our study will be evaluation of new stroke, mortality, central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage, major bleeding, drop out and other unwanted side effects in first week and three months after stroke."
NCT03228251,"Acute stroke care is highly time critical for thrombolysis as well as thrombectomy. In both scenarios, each minute lost reduces the therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, an optimal implementation of these effective therapies into daily clinical practice is of utmost importance for the translation of the evidence from clinical trials into good clinical outcomes in routine care. In acute stroke therapy, the patient is cared for by an interdisciplinary team and often has to undergo several handovers between different caregivers with possible interface problems.

To facilitate a smooth workflow, the investigator developed an interdisciplinary stroke team algorithm and implemented regular simulation-based team trainings at the investigators institution. This multimodal intervention markedly improved the ""door-to-needle"" time for thrombolysis (time from the patient's arrival in the emergency department to the start of the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) infusion) which is the most relevant benchmark parameter for acute stroke care. The investigators monthly stroke team training had a positive effect on the perceived degree of safety and staff satisfaction among the employees of the investigators departments.

The investigator plans to investigate the benefits of the multimodal intervention of a stroke team algorithm with regular stroke team simulation training in a controlled prospective pretest-posttest trial design at seven leading stroke centers in Germany. The investigator hypothesize that the implementation of a stroke team algorithm (defined team, defined tasks) and regular stroke team training with a focus on efficient team work and communication will improve process times, patient safety and staff satisfaction.

In the pretest period, the participating seven centers (tertiary care university hospitals with thrombectomy capacity 24/7/365) record the data of all consecutive patients receiving thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy during a three month period. Afterwards 3-4 leading employees of different professional backgrounds (e.g. senior neurologist of the stroke unit, neurointerventionalist, head nurse of emergency department) will be invited to a joint ""train-the-trainer"" seminar at the sponsors institution where the participating centers present their algorithm to the participants of all seven stroke centers for discussion to invite suggestions for streamlining and improvement and a train-the-trainer course of stroke simulation. After the seminar, the principal investigator and stroke team trainer will visit all centers for one in situ stroke team simulation training and provide teaching materials. Afterwards, each center will be invited to schedule two additional stroke team trainings a with stroke team trainer that will be led by e.g. the senior neurologist from the respective stroke unit with the aim of permanently starting up regular stroke team simulation. In the posttest period, the participating seven centers again record the data of all consecutive patients receiving thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy during a three month time period."

NCT01678547,"Stroke are the main causes of motor disability among adults and are expected to impose an increasing social and economic burden for our Country. The impact of stroke on patients is enormous, with negative ramifications on the persons participation in social, vocational, and recreational activities. It is the primary cause of long-term disability in these countries. At the present stage, it is well known that control of balance during upright standing depends upon the central integration of afferent information from vestibular, somatosensory (proprioceptive, tactile), and visual systems, which constitute a multilink neural network for the control of neck, hip, and ankle joints. More recently, it has been studied at the level of cerebral cortex; vestibular inputs would reach face/neck representation of primary somatosensory cortex and would be then integrated with visual and somatosensory inputs in intraparietal, posterior end of the insula and medial superior temporal cortices. Remarkably, balance impairment and the associated risk of falling represent one of the most prominent and potentially disabling features in stroke subjects. The specific aims of this project are: to verify whether the robotics lower limb treatment with body weight support is more effective than the treadmill treatment in the reduction of motor impairment in Stroke patients, and to improve the quality of the gait and the endurance and to analyze possible improvements in terms of physiological biomechanical gait through analysis of spatio-temporal parameters."
NCT01658111,"Numerous studies showed that ascertaining the effectiveness of rehabilitative interventions on conditions leading to long-term disability, such as stroke, is a complex task because the outcome depends on many interacting factors. Several studies underline the importance of brain plasticity and its therapeutic potential in neurological disorders. Accredited theories of cortical reorganization after brain lesion endorse the use of early, intensive, repetitive, and context-related exercise as optimal strategies to promote motor relearning and minimize motor deficit. The use of robotic systems in upper limb motor rehabilitation programs has been already demonstrated to provide safe and intensive treatment to subjects with motor impairments due to a neurological injury: several studies showed the advantages of robotic therapy on chronic post-stroke patients, even if no consistent influence on functional abilities was found and evidence of better results providing intensive treatments, both robotic and conventional rehabilitative techniques, was found. Recent development and recent trial in robot-assisted rehabilitation has shown the great potential of robotic devices for delivering repetitive training, thus facilitating a high intensity and a large dose of training during sub-acute and chronic phases of stroke rehabilitation. The proposed project, through a randomized controlled observer-blind multicenter trial is aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of robot-assisted therapy as additional treatment to the standard physical therapy in the early phase after stroke onset and evaluating in conjunction with EEG and EMG recordings the effects of the rehabilitative treatments in a quantitative, measurable way, by providing reliable and objective methods for measuring functional recovery after stroke."
NCT05495191,"Arterial wall shear stress (WSS) contributes to atherosclerosis from its inception, progression, and disruption of plaque. However, there is no previous study for an association between cerebral artery WSS and clinical outcome in patients with ischemic stroke in lenticulostriate artery.

The researchers aimed to investigate whether the signal intensity gradient (SIG) from Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography (TOF MRA) in cerebral arteries, as a surrogate measure of arterial WSS, is associated with clinical outcome, which was determined with modified Rankin Scale (mRS).

The patients (n=294) with the lenticulostriate artery infarction were collected in 3 hospitals with variable locations and sizes (Gunsan, Jeonju, and Seoul). For a clinical outcome, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were checked serially from the date of admission. The mRS 2 or less at the 7th day or discharge was defined as a favorable outcome. The arterial SIGs were measured concurrently in both internal carotid, anterior/middle/posterior cerebral, vertebral arteries, and basilar artery from TOF MRA on initial diagnosis. The independent association between the clinical outcome and cerebral arterial SIG was analyzed adjusting for all the possible potential confounders."

NCT05494489,"Stroke remains the 4th cause of death in Singapore and despite advances in medical care and rehabilitation, 40-50% of stroke survivors are left with permanent disability and reduced quality of life. Hand motor impairment is a very serious complication to every stroke survivor. These impairments include difficulty moving and coordinating the hands and fingers, which inhibits stroke patients from being able to perform daily functional tasks independently, resulting in a reduced quality of life.

More than half of people with upper limb impairment after stroke will still have problems many months to years after their stroke. Therefore, improving hand function is a core element of rehabilitation where the aim is to recover and recruit the damaged neurons in the brain as soon as possible, within 3-6 months of the stroke as it thought to be the golden recovery period.

In the hospital setting, every stroke patient will receive about 30 minutes to 1 hour of occupational therapy (OT) for functional training, including hand functional exercises. However, manpower constraints limited stroke patients to one OT session per day but they are encouraged to continuously practice on their own, which may cause patients to encounter difficulties without guidance and hence less motivated to perform.

This proposed research aims to assess the efficacy and feasibility of the EsoGLOVE with Trigno Biofeedback (EMG sensors) in the inpatient rehabilitation setting through:

Understanding the ability of the EsoGLOVE with Trigno Biofeedback (EMG sensors) in providing CPM exercise and assisting stroke patients with completing hand functional tasks, eventually improves patients' motor function and neural recovery.
To generate evidence on this innovative device and further deploy it in clinical practice. A Health Technology Assessment (HTA) will be generated from this study to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

The investigators hypothesize that EsoGLOVE with Trigno Biofeedback (EMG sensors) combined with hand rehabilitation will add additional benefits to stroke patients. It might have better hand functional outcomes than hand rehabilitation alone as it can allow the patients to conduct functional task training in both passive and active modes."

NCT05493813,"The present clinical trial compares the effect of two general anesthesia (GA) modalities, the one with volatile anesthetic sevoflurane (endotracheal-intubated) and the other integrating total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol (non-intubated), on post-procedural delirium and cognitive dysfunction after endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in the participants with acute ischemic stroke. To assess the outcome of both modalities, the sedation depth of GA will be regulated with processed electroencephalogram monitor to reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium and the peri-procedural blood pressure will be controlled according to the guideline.Based on that, the investigators try to find a better general anesthetic modality for acute ischemic stroke participants undergoing EVT."

NCT05487417,"Minocycline is the second generation of tetracycline. Because of its lipophilicity, it has high penetrance of blood-brain barrier. Animal model studies have shown that minocycline can reduce cerebral damage after ischemic stroke, and its mechanism involves multiple molecular pathways, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti apoptotic pathways, and protection of blood-brain barrier. Clinical studies have also shown that minocycline can significantly improve 3-month National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of patients with ischemic stroke, indicating that minocycline is a potential neuroprotective drug. Minocycline is believed to protect the blood-brain barrier, thereby reducing the ischemia-reperfusion injury caused by mechanical thrombectomy. However, whether minocycline can become a synergistic treatment method of mechanical thrombectomy, there is no clinical research in this area at present. Therefore, investigators carry out the study on the effect of minocycline in patients with acute anterior circulation ischemic stroke after mechanical thrombectomy, and plan to enroll 180 patients. To explore the safety and effectiveness of minocycline in patients with acute ischemic stroke after thrombectomy."
NCT05492435,"Stroke has been considered one of the main causes of long-term disability in the adult population. Technological advances in the neurological area have been observed in the last decades, which accentuates the interest in promoting non-invasive stimulation techniques, capable of modulating brain polarity, where among these techniques is the transcranial direct current stimulation - tDCS. Previous studies analyzed by systematic reviews suggest that the effects of tDCS may vary between individuals, where some stroke patients may not receive any additional benefit from the therapy. Thus, it is necessary to use a biomarker that can choose those that will possibly benefit from the electric current. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify the dynamics of EEG microstates after tDCS and dual-task training in subjects after chronic stroke, as well as to assess how microstate parameters in stroke patients are altered by tDCS and dual-task training. at three different moments (Stimulation in M1 + dual-task training; Stimulation in M1 and DLPF + dual-task training; Sham stimulation) and to observe whether the microstates encode information that reflects the motor and/or cognitive capacity of these patients."

NCT05490628,"One of the most common complications in stroke patients is cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment affects a large part of the life of stroke patients. However, the relationship between cognitive impairment and fear of falling in stroke patients has not been investigated in any study yet. Various treatment approaches have been developed to improve cognitive function. While some of these approaches focus on improving cognitive function, others aim to reach the maximum functional level with various compensation methods taught to the patient in the current cognitive situation. As a result of cognitive interventions, stroke patients' participation in daily life, adherence to treatment and quality of life increase. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of cognitive interventions on motor performance, balance and fear of falling. This study will contribute to the literature by investigating these effects of cognitive rehabilitation."
NCT05487924,"The FloTrac/Vigileo is a minimal invasive device assessing flow based hemodynamic parameters by pulse contour analysis based on the radial artery pressure signal. This method gained popularity as it is minimally invasive compared to esophageal Doppler or pulmonary artery catheter insertion and provides continuous beat-to-beat data. The previous study with 110 patients found that that GDHT guided by stroke volume variation (SVV) using the FloTrac/Vigileo device was associated with a reduced length of hospital stay and a lower incidence of POGD in major abdominal oncological surgery. However, no difference was found in the incidence of postoperative complications between the two groups, lack of statistical power could be a limitation to demonstrate the true association. Therefore, further prospective trials are needed to address this issue.

The use of early and efficient therapeutic strategies able to detect and to treat potential triggers of organ failures, such as tissue hypoperfusion, is particularly important. If hypoperfusion is not adequately managed, tissue hypoxia could occur, resulting from an impairment of the adaptive mechanisms of myocardial contractile function, under the influence of inflammatory mediators, and the peripheral tissues will then increase their oxygen extraction (O2ER). AS such, GDHT guided by O2ER may be appropriate to monitor GDHT strategies because it reflects the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption.

Therefore, the investigators performed this single-center, randomized, controlled trial to investigate whether GDHT guided by SVV using FloTrac/Vigileo monitor and GDHT guided by O2ER would reduce incidence of postoperative complication and shorten the length of hospital stay, compared with a standard conventional fluid therapy in low-to-moderate risk patients undergoing major laparoscopic gastrointestinal oncological surgery."

NCT05484843,"There are many methods that nurses use while providing care education to individuals. Tele-nursing, which is one of the current methods, is an innovative approach, but it is a useful method in meeting the post-discharge home care needs of patients who are dependent or partially dependent on others and who live in areas far from health care institutions. In today's health care delivery system, it is of great importance to develop a tele-nursing-based care approach by making effective infrastructure studies related to tele-nursing services. Although a limited number of studies have been conducted on different patient groups regarding the tele-nursing method in Turkey, no study has been found that determines the effect of tele-nursing education on patients' quality of life and self-care power in stroke patients. In this respect, it is thought that it is important to conduct studies that will examine the effects of tele-nursing on patients who need long-term care such as stroke at the national level.

The aim of this study is to find out the effects of telenursing training based on self-care theory which was given to patients diagnosed with stroke on quality of life and self-care agency."

NCT05410054,"30% - 66% of stroke survivors have upper limb dysfunction. Effective rehabilitation can improve the prognosis, but the rehabilitation resources are limited. How to evaluate the prognosis early and formulate an individualized rehabilitation plan based on realistic expectations is still inconclusive. The current research shows that some brain network changes are related to the recovery of motor function. The dynamic connection of multi-modal and spatio-temporal fusion of motor network is helpful to the prognosis analysis of upper limb dyskinesia after stroke. 178 stroke patients will be included in this project. Fugl-Meyer motor function scale (upper limb part) and Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) will be evaluated at enrollment, 1month/3month/6month after onset. According to the results, the groups with good prognosis and poor prognosis will be distinguished; blood oxygen level dependent imaging and diffusion tensor imaging will be collected at the same time to compare the similarities and differences of the function and structural connection of the motion network; the correlation between interhemispheric connection, intrahemispheric connection, cross network connection of motor network and prognosis will be analyzed, the clinical and imaging features of different prognosis will be extracted.

NCT05401799,"The Barrett Upper Extremity Robot (BURT) is an FDA-approved upper extremity robot that assists patients with both passive and active range of motion while providing adjustable resistance (Barrett_Medical. Robotic Assist Rehabilitation Made Easy. https://medical.barrett.com/). Activities are directed by therapists and encourage patient involvement through video game activities providing active proprioceptive, vibrational, visual and auditory feedback. Engaging and colorful games are beneficial in holding patients' interest, and gravity assistance may also allow for increased repetition in the face of patient fatigue.

In this prospective study, the investigators will determine if a standardized BURT Upper Extremity (UE) program can be consistently implemented within an acute inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF). In addition, the investigators will see if patients who receive BURT have improved UE mobility and function as a result. The investigators will also study the perceived enjoyment and value of the intervention by patients, and perceived value by therapists.

Because BURT therapy is able to provide more repetitions of upper extremity movement in a shorter length of time than conventional therapy, the investigators hypothesize that patients who participate in neuro re-education activities using BURT will achieve greater improvements in strength, upper extremity function, fine motor coordination, activities of daily living and mobility during their time in an IRF than patients receiving conventional therapy.

In this study, eligible patients admitted to Sunnyview Rehabilitation Hospital (SRH) for rehabilitation following stroke will be randomized to receive conventional or BURT therapy. Meaningful clinical benchmarks for upper extremity function, tone, fine motor coordination, activities of daily living and mobility will be assessed using the Upper Extremity Motor Assessment Scale (UE-MAS)(Zelter, 2010), manual muscle testing (MMT), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) (Figueiredo, 2011) and the 9-hole peg test (9HPT)(Figueiredo, 2011).

NCT05483751,"Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) results from a complex combination of macro- and microvascular processes. Besides cerebral vasospasms (CVS), DCI is caused by microthrombosis, neuroinflammation, microvascular dysfunction and cortical spreading depolarization.The glycocalyx plays an essential role in regulation of inflammation, oxidative stress and thrombosis, and could be involved in the pathophysiology of DCI. This study is a single-center prospective observational pilot (phase 1) and correlation (phase 2) study recruiting patients with an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of performing measurements of the glycocalyx using side-stream darkfield (SDF) imaging sublingually and on the conjunctiva, and by sampling blood for analysis of markers of glycocalyx shedding. Moreover, the objective is to determine characteristic Doppler waveform morphologies in DCI patients by means of thorough analysis of transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurements. The secondary objective is to determine whether changes in glycocalyx integrity correlate with the development of DCI and whether these changes are associated with increased inflammation and with variation in TCD signals. Finally, changes in glycocalyx integrity, in TCD waveform morphology and in levels of inflammatory markers will be correlated with patient outcome at 6 weeks and 6 months after ictus."

NCT05345886,"This study aims to explore the interest of hippotherapy in the management of patients with stroke in the sequelae phase by evaluating the psychological and physical well-being. It is a controlled and randomized prospective longitudinal study.

Hippotherapy is a rehabilitation method entrusted to a paramedical or medical profession that uses the horse in its treatment program in addition to conventional medical care.

Hippotherapy has benefits at the psychomotor and motor level. The method is based on the use of the horse's characteristic movements when walking to provide sensory information and to induce motor adjustment responses mainly at the level of the pelvis and the trunk of the rider in order to work on balance, postural control, muscle tone and joint mobility of the patient sitting on his back. In particular for people with paresis or plegia sequelae, it contributes to rehabilitation programs. In addition, by inducing a helical movement of the pelvis, the horse's walk reproduces in the the disabled rider a pattern of trunk reactions very similar to that of the normal human walking pattern. This pattern can be integrated as a normal sensorimotor reaction and help the patient to improve his sitting balance and his coordination.

Hippotherapy is also interesting because getting out of the traditional rehabilitation framework and being in contact with an imposing animal has positive repercussions on the psyche and therefore on functional recovery.

All patients will undergo an assessment that will focus on their physical and psychological well-being at the beginning and end of the study as well as during a follow-up at 2 weeks, one month and 3 months.

Patients assigned to the experimental group (EG) will receive, in addition to their physical therapy, a weekly hippotherapy session of 30 minutes. The follow-up will take place during 3 months for a total of 12 sessions. The EG will also be monitored in the short term (before and after each session) for well-being and fatigue.

NCT05335109,"In the Russian Federation, ischemic cerebral infarction is recorded annually in more than 450,000 people. It is the second most common cause of death after coronary heart disease.

The 30-day mortality rate after an ischemic cerebral infarction is more than 25%, and during the following year about half of the patients die. To date, all candidate neuroprotective drugs tested in various clinical trials have demonstrated insufficient efficacy . Therefore, the development of new approaches to the treatment of severe brain injuries of various etiologies is one of the most important tasks of critical condition medicine.

Brain damage due to stroke triggers a number of pathophysiological reactions, which are based on the accumulation of glutamate with the development of excitotoxicity. The effect of glutamate on NMDA receptors is one of the main factors of neurodegenerative disorders.

Xenon is an anesthetic whose neuroprotective properties have been shown in many experimental studies. Хenon inhalation after ischemia and reperfusion suppresses ischemic brain damage and tPA-induced cerebral hemorrhages, and damage to the blood-brain barrier.

The most interesting is a randomized controlled trial performed by R. Laitio et al. (2016), in which the use of xenon in combination with hypothermia in clinical practice was studied for the first time. In patients who have undergone community-acquired cardiac arrest, xenon inhalation at a concentration of 40 vol.% within 24 hours in combination with hypothermia, led to less damage to the white matter of the brain than with patients using hypothermia alone. The 6-month mortality rate was 27% in the xenon and hypothermia group and 35% in the hypothermia group.

It is important to note that today, despite a large pool of convincing preclinical studies proving the neuroprotective properties of xenon, there is not a single clinical study of its use in ischemic stroke.

Therefore, the research objectives is to determine whether the strategy of using xenon-oxygen mixture inhalation is better than oxygen-air mixture inhalation with respect to the change in scores on the NIHSS, Rankin and Glasgow coma scales on day 7, the duration of stay in the ICU and the frequency of nosocomial pneumonia."
NCT05323266,"Acute ischemic stroke is the second leading cause of death and disability, and it is also one of the main reasons for the high cost of health care. The major risk factors for stroke are hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and smoking, which are the main intervention targets for primary stroke prevention. Although these recognized risk factors have been adequately treated, there are also significant differences in stroke incidence and outcome in the population. Sleep apnea is a common complication of acute ischemic stroke, characterized by upper airway obstruction and obstructive sleep apnea.

Nowadays, more studies are currently investigating CPAP to promote long-term neurological recovery, improve the ability to perform activities of daily living, and reduce the recurrence of cardiovascular disease in stroke patients. However, 25%-50% of patients with sleep apnea will refuse or be intolerant of ventilation with CPAP. High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy is a revolutionary non-invasive respiratory support option that is widely used in NICU worldwide. There is currently a significant increase in the rate of pulmonary infections in stroke patients presenting with sleep apnea, leading to an increase in both length and cost of hospitalization, yet there are no better preventive measures available in the clinic. This project aims to investigate the value of different ventilation methods in reducing the rate of pulmonary infections and tracheal intubation in stroke patients.

This project is a prospective randomized cohort study, collecting patients with acute ischemic stroke in the intensive care unit of the Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology from 2022.05.01 to 2023.04.30. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were subjected to polysomnography on the first day of admission, and those diagnosed with sleep apnea according to the diagnostic criteria for sleep apnea were randomly grouped. Patients were given different forms of oxygen therapy, such as conventional oxygen therapy (nasal cannula oxygenation), nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP), and HFNC oxygen therapy. After one week of observation, we evaluated whether there were differences in the rate of tracheal intubation and pulmonary infection between the groups, as well as the length of hospitalization, hospital costs, and neurological recovery. All enrolled patients were followed up at 3 months after discharge."

NCT05303649,"Aphasia is an impairment in the ability to express and/or understand language, commonly observed after stroke to the language dominant (left) hemisphere. Despite natural tendency to spontaneous functional recovery in the first months post stroke and language improvement due to application of behavioral speech and language therapy (SLT), many aphasic patients do not achieve satisfactory level of verbal communication. The aim of the planned study is to explore the potential of the noninvasive repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) as a therapeutic tool for aphasia in addition to traditional behavioral therapy. In case of aphasia, studies on therapeutic effectiveness of rTMS aim to increase the activity of the language-dominant left cerebral hemisphere, which may be achieved in an indirect manner by inhibiting the activity of the opposite (right) hemisphere or in a direct manner by increasing the excitability of preserved language areas in the left hemisphere. In our study, we plan to administer the newest form of rTMS called Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS), which is safer than the conventional rTMS, even when used in the perilesional area. Computer-based neuronavigation system will be implemented to precisely localize stimulation targets, control administration of stimuli during rTMS sessions, and evaluate differences between participants regarding deviations from established stimulation points. 45 patients (all right-handed, polish native speakers, aged 18-75 years, diagnosed with non-fluent aphasia) will be enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups: 1) a group with excitatory intermittent TBS of the left hemisphere (iTBS group), 2) a group with inhibitory continuous TBS of the right hemisphere (cTBS group), 3) a group with sham TBS (sTBS group as a control group). Specific forms of stimulation will be carried out for three consecutive weeks (Monday to Friday; a total of 15 stimulation sessions). Immediately after each session of the stimulation, patients will undergo individual SLT. Assessment of language functioning will be carried out three times: before and after the therapy period, and 3 months after its completion. Results of the study will broaden knowledge about hemispherical mechanisms of language and speech recovery after stroke and provide insight into possibilities of their modulation for the purpose of post-stroke rehabilitation."

The group of cryptogenic strokes includes those with patent foramen ovale (PFO) or other abnormalities in the atrial septum in the heart as the only or concomitant finding. Population prevalence of PFO is high, 25%, and the mechanisms how PFO would be associated causally with ischemic stroke remain to be clarified. Moreover, there are only scarce data on clinical outcome, long-term risk of new vascular events, and prevention of such events in these patients.

DESIGN: Searching for Explanations for Cryptogenic Stroke in the Young: Revealing the Etiology, Triggers, and Outcome (SECRETO) is an international prospective multicenter case-control study of young adults (age 18-49) presenting with an imaging-positive first-ever ischemic stroke of undetermined etiology (aim N=2000). Patients are included after standardized diagnostic procedures (brain MRI, imaging of intracranial and extracranial vessels, cardiac imaging, and screening for coagulopathies) and age- and sex-matched to healthy controls in a 1:1 fashion. Up to 45 study sites worldwide will be needed to recruit the planned participant population during a 3-year period. Neurovascular imaging and echocardiography studies, and ECGs will be read centrally.

AIMS: SECRETO involves five principal fields of investigation: (1) Stroke triggers and clinical risk factors; (2) Long-term prognosis (new vascular events, functional and psychosocial outcomes); (3) Abnormalities of thrombosis and hemostasis; (4) Biomarkers of e.g. inflammation, atherogenesis, endothelial function, thrombosis, platelet activation, and hemodynamic stress to characterize postulated cryptogenic stroke mechanisms; and (5) genetic study, including genome-wide association and candidate gene studies as well as next-generation sequencing approach. All analyses consider cardiac functional and interatrial structural properties as a possible mediator. Furthermore, SECRETO Family Study (substudy) aims at collecting extensive family history of thrombotic events from informative patients being screened for SECRETO main study and collect genetic samples from all consenting family members for whole-genome sequencing.

SIGNIFICANCE: SECRETO will provide novel information on clinical and subclinical risk factors, both transient and chronic, predisposing to cryptogenic ischemic stroke in young adults. This study also reveals long-term prognosis of this understudied patient population and may discover new genetic background underlying the disease mechanism and provide potential targets for drug development."

NCT05229185,"Even in a chronic phase after stroke, most patients have difficulty moving the affected arm, resulting in limitations in simple tasks in daily living, most frequently limiting reaching task. In the chronic phase, significant improvements are usually no longer observed. Nevertheless, even these patients can still improve their functional abilities due to exercise-dependent plasticity.

A new device was developed, the deXtreme robot, a rehabilitation device that offers error-enhancement approach during three-dimensional movements. The goal error-enhancement is to elicit better accuracy, stability, fluidity and range of motion during reaching. games are projected on a screen, requiring 3D active reaching movements. The duration of the study for a single participant will be 7 consecutive working days, including 1 day of pre-intervention assessment, 5 days of training and 1 day of post-intervention assessment. The overall aim of this project is to gain knowledge into the potential of error-enhancement robot training in patients with upper limb impairments in the chronic phase after stroke.

NCT03208634,"Robotic rehabilitation is promising to promote function in stroke patients. The assist as needed training paradigm has shown to stimulate neuroplasticity but often cannot be used because stroke patients are too impaired to actively control the robot against gravity. Aim of this study is to present a novel robotic approach based on fully assisted functional movements and to examine the effect of the intervention in terms of motor function improvement in subjects with chronic stroke in the short term and at 6-month follow up. A preliminary evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention in improving activity and participation in the short term is also performed. Further, the study aims to verify whether some instrumental measures (using kinematics, EMG and EEG) may help gain insight into the mechanisms leading to improved motor ability following the robotic intervention and can be used to predict functional recovery."
NCT05213104,"About 30% of ischemic strokes are cryptogenic. Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) is present in about 25% of the general population. In cryptogenic strokes, PFO has been shown to be overrepresented and recent intervention studies have confirmed that PFO has a causal link with stroke. In patients with recent cryptogenic stroke, these randomized studies have shown at least 50%-reduction of recurrent neurological events after PFO percutaneous closure compared with medical therapy alone. At the The risk of AF reported in these studies in certainly largely underestimated as only symptomatic and recorded episodes of AF have been declared. Patients often report palpitations without a dia gnosis of AF made on the ECG or a Holter. Long term ECG monitoring provides more accurate data on AF incidence.

Administration of flecainide has been shown to be effective in preventing AF and may be useful in preventing these AF episodes after PFO closure.

To the knowledge of the investigators, there is no study assessing the efficacy of any antiarrhythmic drug in the prevention of AF after PFO closure. AFLOAT will be the first randomized study to possibly validate flecainide to prevent AF in these patients."

NCT05191524,"Stroke, described as a neurological deficit caused by the interruption of cerebral blood flow, is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity throughout the world. It is the second most common medical condition and the major cause of disability in adults. Recovery following stroke revolves around the severity of sensory, motor, and cognitive impairments. Lower extremity impairment is one of the major post-stroke conditions which can cause difficulty in performing activities of daily living, gait abnormalities, increased risk of fall, and restriction in social participation. Rehabilitation after stroke is the primary mechanism through which it can achieve functional recovery and independence, which is based on the principles of motor learning and neuroplasticity."

During the past two decades, music interventions have increasingly shown effectiveness in several motor tasks in stroke rehabilitation. Additionally, music has been found effective in increasing exercise performance in athletes and other clinical populations. Based on a meta-theoretical review paper by Clark, Baker & Taylor (2016), it was hypothesized that the therapeutic effects of music in physical exercise is modulated by the preference and task-specificity of the music. We will test this hypothesis using a three-armed randomized cross-over design comprised of the following auditory conditions: 1) a group-tailored playlist 2) radio as active control and 3) a non-music control condition during cycle ergometry cardiorespiratory exercise sessions. Participants are inpatient stroke survivors undergoing rehabilitation between 2-12 weeks post infarct."

NCT02759653,"BACKGROUND: In 30-40% the cause of ischemic stroke remains undetermined. Most likely, this category hides an additional number of strokes caused by artery-to-artery embolisms due to unidentified atherosclerotic disease, or caused by cardioembolism. Both types are associated with a high risk of recurrent ischemic events and multiple cerebral infarctions.

Large-artery atherosclerosis of the brain-supplying arteries is the assumed underlying cause in 10 to 15% of ischemic stroke, mostly deriving from the extracranial carotid artery. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) measured by 2-dimensional (2D) B-mode ultrasonography and estimation of the overall atherosclerotic plaque burden aids future risk prediction. Arterial wall changes, artery caliber variations, degree of stenosis, local hemodynamic alterations and certain plaque characteristics are important for the evaluation of plaque vulnerability and vascular risk stratification. Transcranial Doppler monitoring (TCDM) is a non-invasive bedside examination eligible for detection of microemboli in the human cerebral circulation.

HYPOTHESIS: Atherosclerotic stenosis and plaque characteristics can be more accurately assessed by the combination of routine 2D ultrasound, contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), and 3-dimensional (3D) ultrasound. TCDM, CEUS and 3D visualization of the carotid plaque improve the differentiation of stroke etiology and quantification of plaque vulnerability, and aid the prediction of future risk for cerebrovascular events in the individual patient.

AIMS: Assessment of prevalence and frequency of Microemboli signals (MES) in unselected patients with cerebral ischemia, the influence of antithrombotic drugs on MES, and the relationship between MES and recurrent stroke or Transient ischemic attack (TIA).

Categorization of atherosclerotic carotid artery disease by use of routine and advanced neurosonographic techniques combined with anamnestic and clinical data.

NCT04302493,"The investigators don't fully understand how, regardless of the size or location in the brain, minor strokes can result in significant problems with focus, attention, and multi-tasking that prevent individuals from returning to an active lifestyle, and negatively impact quality of life; but the investigators' preliminary data using magnetoencephalography (MEG) suggest that there may be disruption of the neuronal network and abnormal frontal lobe activity in the brain after stroke. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is effective at treating frontal lobe dysfunction in the form of anxiety and depression occurring during the chronic phase of stroke recovery. The aim of this study is to use MBSR to improve other forms of frontal lobe dysfunction (cognitive outcomes) during the subacute phase of recovery, when patients are making critical decisions regarding patients' ability to return to work or live independently; and to use MEG, a tool capable of imaging brain activity and neuronal networks, to understand the brain changes that correspond to improvement after treatment."

A modified version of the MST protocol has been created (hereafter, referred as enriched MST, eMST) to include (i) a home-based self-training program using an app for electronic tablets and (ii) weekly group sessions of musical playing strengthening the motivational and emotional components of music playing. A randomised controlled trial will be conducted to test the effectiveness of this enriched MST (eMST) protocol in improving motor functions, cognition, emotional well-being and quality of life when compared to a program of home-based exercises utilizing the Graded Repetitive Arm Supplementary Program (GRASP). Sixty stroke patients will be recruited and randomly allocated to an eMST group (n=30) or a control GRASP intervention group (n=30). Patients will be evaluated before and after a 10-week intervention, as well as at 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome of the study is the functionality of the paretic upper limb measured with the Action Research Arm Test. Secondary outcomes include other motor and cognitive functions, emotional well-being and quality of life measures as well as self-regulation and self-efficacy outcomes.

NCT04673123,"Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and death worldwide. Falling is defined as a person accidentally lying on a floor or another low level with or without injury. In patients with stroke occur motor, sensory, functional and cognitive disorders which are increased the rate of falls after stroke. Physiological and psychological complications that occur as a result of a fall are exhausting for both the patient and the therapist. Because while the patients regress physiologically even more, the 'fear of falling again', which occurs with falling, reduces the patient's participation in rehabilitation.When looking at the risk factors determined for falls in stroke patients, reduced mobility and impaired balance functions are in the first place and that is evidenced with most of falls occur during walking and transfers the most frequent.The main reason of affected mobility is the weakness in the deep trunk muscles and insufficient stability, except for the loss of strength in the affected lower extremity. In the literature, it is stated that having strong core muscles can contribute to the efficient use of the lower extremity. According to the previous studies, applied stabilization exercises in addition to traditional rehabilitation improve the balance and mobility functions of patients with subacute stroke. However, there is not enough information about the benefits of these exercises in patients with chronic stroke. Most falls occur at home specially in the bedroom and bathroom in patients with stroke. This indicates that environmental factors should be taken into consideration in the rehabilitation program besides physical factors, that is, a ""multifactorial falls prevention program"" should be implemented. Based on these information, the aim of our study is to investigate the benefits of core stabilization exercises which is included in a multifactorial training on falling number, fear of falling, lower extremity function and balance in patients with chronic stroke who have a history of falling."
NCT04673045,"Stroke is commonly associated with increased spasticity that affects patients' function and increased risk of fall. Interventional approaches have been used to decrease spasticity including pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. However, Limited research has examined non-pharmacological interventions such as neuromuscular electric stimulation (NMES) on spasticity and health outcomes in people with stroke. So, The primary purpose of this study is to establish a protocol for a randomized clinical trial to examine using NMES on spasticity, muscle strength, physical functions, and self-reported health outcomes in people with chronic stroke in Saudi Arabia.

This randomized clinical trial will be double blinded for both participants and assessors to enroll 40 participants with chronic stroke to either interventional group or control shame group. The intervention will be 3 times a week for 4 weeks for both groups. Outcomes will include calf muscle spasticity, pretibial muscle strength, ankle range of motion, gait speed, balance, functional mobility, walking endurance, and self-reported health measures such as quality of life, physical activity, fatigue, and risk of fall. Independent t-test will be utilized to examine the effect of intervention on change score means for outcome measures. Using 4 weeks of NMES will provide information about its effect in improving spasticity, physical functions, and other self-reported health outcomes in people with chronic stroke when compared to control shame NMES.

NCT04559373,"While stroke survivors discharged from rehabilitation present with some recovery in mobility, their ability to ambulate in the community remains limited. The investigators propose to test a novel, low-cost, intensive and individually tailored intervention that combines virtual reality (VR) and field training to enhance community ambulation and participation in stroke survivors discharged from rehabilitation.

The aims are to: (1) Assess feasibility, acceptability, safety and adherence of the intervention in stroke survivors; and (2) Examine the extent to which post-intervention changes in functional walking and participation to community walking vary according to walking, cognitive and visual-perceptual abilities.

The investigators will use a virtual environment prototype simulating a shopping mall and surrounding streets, in which participants will interact using VR goggles and game controllers. Scenarios of increasing levels of complexity will be introduced. This intervention study involves a single group, multiple pre- multiple post- study design where chronic stroke participants will engage in a 4-week training program. The program will include VR training sessions performed in the clinical setting (3/week) and practice of community ambulation skills while supervised by family/caregivers (2/week). Participants will be assessed on measures of functional walking, balance & mobility and participation to community walking. Adherence, safety and acceptability will be documented.

NCT04649398,"Nimodipine reduces the risk of poor outcome and delayed cerebral ischemia in patients suffering aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), but its mode of action is unknown. Its beneficial effect is assumed to be due its neuroprotective effects by reducing intracellular calcium and thereby cellular apoptosis, but higher concentrations might induce marked systemic hypotension, thereby inducing cerebral ischemia. Since several dosing regimes and routes of administration with inconclusive superiority exist and since the target site concentration of nimodipine - the unbound drug concentrations beyond the blood-brain barrier - is still not known, it is reasonable to measure nimodipine concentrations within the blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial brain tissue following oral, intra-venous and intra-arterial administration and correlate intra-arterial nimodipine administration to measures of cerebral metabolism and oxygenation.

Therefore, the investigators propose to investigate in 30 patients suffering severe aneurysmal SAH and requiring cerebral microdialysis for cerebral neurochemical monitoring:

the ability of nimodipine to penetrate into the brain of neurointensive care patients by comparing exposure in brain, CSF and plasma, dependent on the route of administration (i.e. oral, intra-venous, and intra-arterial) and dosing intra-venously (0.5 - 2mg/h)
the impact of orally, intra-venously, and intra-arterially delivered nimodipine on cerebral metabolism, i.e. lactate/pyruvate ratio, pbtO2 and transcranial doppler flow velocities
the effect of oral and intra-venous nimodipine on systemic hemodynamic and cardiac parameters, using continuous Pulse Contour Cardiac Output (PiCCO) monitoring

NCT04425590,"Stroke is one of the most common non-communicable diseases worldwide. It is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in many countries.

Stroke is broadly classified into ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemic stroke is more common than hemorrhagic stroke. In Indonesia, the prevalence of ischemic stroke is 42.9% compare to hemorrhagic stroke 19.9%. Ischemic stroke defined as an episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal cerebral, spinal, or retinal infarction.

One of the main therapy in ischemic stroke is administration of anti thrombotic agent. DLBS1033 is a bioactive protein fraction isolated from Lumbricus rubellus. DLBS1033 possessed quadruple activities that inhibit platelet aggregation, induces fibrinogenolysis, fibrinolysis, and thrombolysis. This is a new proposed medication nowadays. There is still a limited study about DLBS1033. To our knowledge, research concern on the usage of DLBS1033 in stroke patients is very limited in Indonesia. This study aimed to Measure the benefit of DLBS1033 as add on therapy for ischemic stroke patients.

NCT04546217,"A variety of rehabilitation techniques focused on improving disability after stroke have shown significant changes on walking speed, and endurance. Also, the administration of combined techniques showed better results. Previous studies have suggested that embedding behavioral strategies in neurorehabilitation protocols can enhance patient's adherence and participation outside the clinical setting. The addition of a group of behavioral strategies called Transfer Package (TP) has been widely used in motor training protocol (e.g. Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy). The TP has shown to enhance the effects of treatment 2.4 times when compared to motor training alone. However, the effect of TP when combined with robotic gait training remains unexplored. In this study our goal is to combine the TP with robotic gait training. The hypothesis is that using the TP in combination with robotic gait training will enhance the outcome of robotic gait training alone and will induce long term transference and retention of the motor skills observed after treatment. More importantly, this experimental intervention is more meaningful to the patient and can be more easily implemented on the clinical setting. The aims of this study are (1) to assess transfer and long-term retention of walking and balance skills after robotic treadmill gait training combined with the TP, (2) to understand participants' acceptability and perceptions of the TP as a tool to enhance transfer of skills to real-world situations, and (3) to examine the feasibility of these combined intervention to improve walking and balance after stroke."

Despite the best available physiotherapy, 30-60% of stroke survivors remain affected by difficulty walking, with foot weakness often being the main cause. Given that post-stroke gait impairments remain poorly addressed, new methods that can provide lasting improvements are necessary. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology may be one such novel approach. BCI technology enables ""direct brain control"" of external devices such as assistive devices and prostheses by translating brain waves into control signals.

NCT04047134,"Much recent interest was raised by the use of Action Observation Treatment (AOT) in stroke patients rehabilitation. AOT, well-grounded in neurophysiology, is an updated approach, based on mirror neuron system (MNS) used to rebuild motor function despite injuries by engaging the brain regions active during action execution in individuals with limited mobility. This project aims at identifying, for the first time in Italy, neurophysiological electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers able to predict rehabilitation outcomes and providing an innovative optimized AOT rehabilitation protocol for chronic Stroke outpatients. EEG will be recorded to identify the most effective stimuli, quantify changes/recovery, profile patients.

Moreover, an innovative AOT home-based program will be implemented. The translational research results will ensure advances in the optimization and personalization of the rehabilitative process thus contributing to improve the quality of life of chronic stroke patients.

Stroke is a leading cause of death and one of the greatest causes of long-term disability that interferes with a good quality of life. Nowadays the rehabilitation interventions are the major component of patient's care to achieve functional outcome. In the last few years, in order to improve Activity of Daily Living (ADL), new noninvasive strategies have emerged as rehabilitative treatments rather than traditional physical therapies. The Action Observation Treatment (AOT), supported by results collected through randomized controlled trials, is one of these. This new rehabilitation approach is based on the properties of the Mirror Neuron System (MNS; 11-13). The extensive research of the last 20 years on the human MNS (hMNS) showed its importance not only in action recognition but also in motor intentions and other social cognitive functions. Lastly, because recruited also in damage brain (18,19), the MNS is demonstrated to provide satisfactory rehabilitative outcomes. The AOT takes advantage of the opportunity to restore functions despite the patient's impairment and it seems to be a valid example of translational medicine from basic neuroscience to rehabilitation. To date, neurophysiological outcomes were never used for translational purposes aimed to the optimization of the therapy and no evidence, in Italy, related to the effectiveness of the home-based program were proposed."

NCT03539445,"Butylphthalide, as a well-known neuroprotective medication, is a family of compounds initially isolated from the seeds of Apium graveolens Linn, of which active ingredient is dl-3-N-butylphthalide (dl-NBP). With the significant effects of reducing the cerebral ischemic damage and eventually improving patients' clinical outcomes, by the potential mechanisms of promoting microcirculation, as well as releasing oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and poststroke inflammation, dl-NBP has been widely applied in acute ischemic stroke as an anti-ischemic drug in China since 2002. While with the evolution of using iv. recombinant tissue plasminogen activator（rtPA ）and mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke（AIS）patients, it is still undefined whether combination therapy with dl-NBP could enhance the curative effect. The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the recovery of neurological deficits in AIS patients who receive iv-rtPA and/or mechanical thrombectomy with the a 3-month regimen of Butylphthalide and Sodium Chloride Injection 100ml twice/day in the initial 14 days and Butylphthalide Soft Capsules 0.2g triple/day for the rest 15th to 90th day therapy versus a 3-month regimen of Butylphthalide Placebo Injection 100ml twice/day in the initial 14 days and followed by Butylphthalide Placebo Soft Capsules 0.2g triple/day for the rest 15th to 90th day therapy."
NCT03451591,"About 35,000 people each year in the UK have a type of stroke, called 'lacunar' or 'small vessel' stroke, which is different to other common types of stroke and for which there is no proven treatment. It is thought that small vessel stroke is caused by damage to the lining of the tiny blood vessels deep inside the brain that stops them functioning normally. This not only causes stroke but, perhaps more importantly, causes problems with thinking and walking, possibly causing up to 45% of all dementias either on its own, or mixed with Alzheimer's disease (about 350,000 patients in the UK). Some drugs that are commonly used in other blood vessel diseases may help improve small vessel function and prevent worsening of brain damage. One drug (cilostazol) has been tested in patients with stroke in the Asia Pacific countries but not on dementia; the other drug (isosorbide mononitrate) is widely used in the UK for heart disease but not stroke. The investigators want to set up a clinical trial to test if the study methods are practical so that patients and trial centres can follow the procedures, and to confirm how many patients have more stroke-like symptoms or experience worsening of their thinking skills. This information is needed to be sure that a very large clinical trial to find out if these drugs can prevent worsening of small vessel disease will be possible."

NCT00777140,"Iron overload has been associated with greater brain injury in ischemia/reperfusion experimental stroke models and ischemic stroke patients, especially in those treated with thrombolytic treatment. Deferoxamine administration, an iron chelator, offers a neuroprotective action in ischemia/reperfusion animal models.

Primary objective: To evaluate the security and tolerability of deferoxamine endovenous treatment in acute ischemic stroke patients treated with iv. tPA.

Secondary objectives: To study pharmacokinetics of deferoxamine given by endovenous bolus (10 mg/Kg) followed by 72-hour continuous intravenous infusion (20, 40 o 60 mg/Kg). To evaluate the deferoxamine effect in clinical outcome, infarct volume and hemorrhagic transformation and brain edema development.

Methodology: Double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, dose-finding phase II clinical trial. Study stages: 1st: bolus+20 mg/Kg/day vs. Placebo (n=15:5); 2nd: bolus+40 mg/Kg/day vs. Placebo (n=15:5); 3rd: bolus+60 mg/Kg/day vs placebo (n=15:5). These doses will be increased according to security results of the previous stage. Patients will be continuously monitored in stroke units. Laboratory parameters will be measured at baseline, 24h, 72h and 30 days to evaluate adverse events related to the drug. Serum deferoxamine and feroxamine concentrations will be measured along time after the injection in a subgroup of patients to the pharmacokinetics study. CT scan will be performed at 24-36h to assess hemorrhagic transformation and brain edema. The NIH Stroke Scale will be evaluated during hospitalization, and the Rankin score at discharge and 3 months.

NCT02748681,"Study Objectives:

Meta-analyses report a high prevalence of moderate to severe sleep apnea of more than 50% in stroke patients, with adherence rates for CPAP therapy of only 30%.

The primary objective of this study is to determine whether CPAP adherence in stroke patients with obstructive sleep apnea can be improved by a CPAP training strategy during rehabilitation combined with a telemedicine monitoring system after discharge.

The secondary objective is to compare recording quality as well as subjective and objective sleep data of non-attended level III polygraphy, polysomnography and telemetric CPAP data in the management of sleep apnea in stroke.

Further the investigators aim to study changes in nocturnal systolic blood pressure due to CPAP therapy with the pulse transit time method.

Finally, the investigators intend to study the relationship between CPAP compliance, sleep and medical and neurorehabilition outcome parameters.

Design:

Single-blind, mono-center, randomized controlled trial on standard CPAP treatment as compared with CPAP treatment with a telemedicine monitoring system in stroke patients with moderate to severe OSA.

Setting: Neurorehabilitation center in Vienna, Austria

Patients: Adult subacute (1 to 12 months post stroke) stroke patients 18-70 yrs of age) with moderate to severe OSA (apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 15/hr) determined by non-attended polysomnography (AHI) ≥ 15/hr of sleep) or level III polygraphy (AHI) ≥ 30/hr of out-of-center sleep testing (OCST), who undergo successful CPAP training and titration (goal AHI< 10) at the neurorehabilitation unit.

Interventions: Patients will be randomized to either standard care with an autotitrating CPAP device or an autotitrating CPAP device that transmits physiologic information (i.e., adherence, air leak, residual AHI) daily to a website that will be reviewed by their homecare provider. If any problems are identified, the patient will be contacted by his homecare provider by telephone. Neurologists performing sleep and neurological scoring will be blinded to the randomization.

Measurements: Recording of the different measuring systems, subjective and objective sleep quality, CPAP adherence after 3 months and 1 year in hours used per night, systolic BP determined by means of a non-linear algorithm and an individual one-point calibration of the pulse transit time obtained with a cuff-based BP measuring system (SOMNOmedics GmbH, Germany) and neurorehabilitation outcome parameters as Barthel Index, Timed Up and Go Test."

NCT03268668,"The recent validation of thrombectomy in addition to thrombolysis with intravenous administration of alteplase suggests a major revolution in the management of acute strokes. This treatment option also opens up a new field of research, making possible the analysis of the clot responsible for intracranial occlusion. Indeed, in about 30% of the cases, the thrombectomy procedure makes it possible to retrieve either partially or completely the clot. Previous studies have analyzed the correlation between the composition of the thrombus and the etiology of stroke. Their discordant results do not yet make it possible to distinguish a particular profile of thrombus according to etiology. Other studies have shown a correlation between the proportion of red blood cells in a thrombus and the likelihood that it is visible in MRI or cerebral scanning. More recently, one study has demonstrated a correlation between the presence of lymphocytes in the thrombus and an atheromatous etiology.

The main limitations of these studies are the small number of patients included, the high variability of conservation protocols and the absence of plasma data, which does not allow for research on the correlation between clot composition and plasma biomarkers."

NCT02735148,"Stroke is one of the most common causes of acquired adult disability. The majority of stroke survivors have mobility difficulties such as poor standing, decreased walking speed, balance disturbances, and increased risk for falls. Improving mobility, functional walking and balance are the main goals of stroke rehabilitation. Robotic technologies are becoming more promising intervention for the locomotor training in stroke rehabilitation. Static or dynamic balance deficits act crucial role on gait performance among stroke survivors. Therefore it is important to determine the effects of BWSTT in improving balance in persons with stroke. Although it has been demonstrated that BWSTT improved balance and gait performance in stroke patients, it is not clear whether the improvements are greater compared with those associated with other gait rehabilitation methods. To the investigators knowledge, there are also limited studies in the literature concerning the effects of BWSTT on falling risk in stroke patients. The strong evidence is needed about the effectiveness of BWSTT including comprehensive determinants of balance with combined and isolated intervention groups.This study aims to compare the effects of BWSTT with combined and isolated intervention on balance, gait and fall risk in patients with subacute and chronic stroke. The investigators hypotheses are that after stroke:

the combination of BWSTT with conventional training may lead to more improved balance parameters;
when applied as an isolated intervention, BWSTT or conventional training may lead to similar results."

NCT04437056,"Stroke is nowadays a leading cause of disability with devastating sequelae. Upper limb spasticity is one of them. Nevertheless, not all the muscles are equally affected, as some may turn spastic or paretic and other remain intact. This unique pathophysiological mosaic dictates a precise therapeutic plan. Existing spasticity treatment has significant drawbacks due to its unspecific targeting and short duration. A causal, life-lasting treatment, precisely adapted to every single patient's needs and to disease pattern, is currently missing. Hyperselective muscle denervation and subsequent cognitive reinnervation with appropriate unaffected donor nerves may break the pathological spastic circuit and provide volitional muscle control. With this pioneering study we will perform cognitive nerve transfers to spastic muscles and will prospectively investigate their effects on clinical, electrophysiological, molecular-biological and histological level. Accurate donor nerve selection will be for the first time quantified through motor unit number estimation with high-density needle electromyography. This revolutionary concept can open the window to a new era of therapeutic possibilities for stroke victims."

NCT05151172,"Stroke occurs when a blood clot causes a blockage in a blood vessel (artery) within the brain. This type of stroke is called an ischemic stroke and carries a high risk of disability or death. Stroke must be treated very fast. Any delay of even 10 minutes can result in the difference between an independent and a disabled outcome, and in some cases between life and death. Endovascular therapy (EVT) or Thrombectomy is a procedure to remove the blood clot (thrombus) from a blood vessel to reopen it (recanalization). Patients are likely to benefit from a thrombectomy procedure when it is performed in a larger blood vessel. Currently it is not known if thrombectomy procedure will benefit the patients presenting with the stroke that has been caused by a blood clot in a medium sized blood vessel (medium vessel occlusion, MeVO). This trial will enrol patients diagnosed with acute stroke due to a clot in the medium sized vessel.

NCT04581759,"Endovascular treatment（ET）is an effective therapy for acute ischemic stroke(AIS) with great vessel obstruction. However, acute complications such as high postoperative perfusion injury, hemorrhagic transformation and restenosis resulted in functional independence in only about 50% of patients 90 days after interventional surgery. Therefore, it is very important to protect the neurologic function after emergency endovascular treatment. The investigators' previous studies have shown that combined with intravenous thrombolytic therapy and remote postconditioning（RIPC）can significantly improve the neurological impairment and short-term and long-term prognosis in patients with acute stroke. In this multicenter, randomized controlled trial, the investigators assumed patients with acute ischemic stroke who had successfully revascularization after ET might benefit from RIPC as well. Patients in the RIPC group had five cycles of 5-min cuff inflation followed by 3-min deflation to the bilateral upper arm after ET. The primary endpoint measure was the proportion of patients with a favorable recovery of nerve function deficient assessed by Modified Rankin Scale （mRS≤2） 90 days after surgery. Secondary endpoints included the following: (1) Symptom endpoints: Neurological intelligence and function scores, postoperative hemorrhagic transformation rate, etc. (2) Blood index test: postoperative inflammatory factors, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and other indicators. (3) Imaging endpoints: MRI-FLAIR , TCD, etc."

It consists of a baseline visit and a 3 months central follow-up for patients who were discharged with dabigatran, vitamin K-antagonists, antiplatelets only, or no oral antithrombotic treatment at all. Thus, data on the use of dabigatran and vitamin K-antagonists in routine clinical practice will be collected to describe how dabigatran is prescribed and used in the population of AF patients with recent cerebrovascular events and how these factors influence important outcome and safety events. The utilization of dabigatran will be assessed with regards to treatment persistence, compliance, proportion of patients discontinuing treatment and reason for discontinuation as well clinical endpoints such as major bleeding, stroke or systemic embolism. Due to the fact that patients will be treated according to local medical practice it is possible that medication will be changed during the observation period. In the follow-up, data from the first as well as from the second prescribed medication will be used in the study.

NCT02687048,"Falls have significant consequences for older adults, including fracture, disability, and death (1). Risk factors for falls include both impaired physical and cognitive function (1). Thus, older adults with chronic stroke are at significant risk for falls (2).

Exercise is an evidence-based approach for reducing falls risk, even among those who are living with stroke-related impairments (3,4). More recently, mindfulness based meditation is gaining recognition for its positive impact on both physical and cognitive health (6,7). Thus, the investigators hypothesize that combining exercise with mindful meditation may be greater impact on falls risk reduction as compared with exercise alone. To begin exploring our hypothesis, we will conduct a 12-week proof-of-concept study among 20 older adults with chronic stroke (i.e., suffered their first clinical stroke > or = 12 months prior to study entry). Participants will be randomly allocated to either: 1) exercise; or 2) exercise + mindfulness based meditation. Outcomes will include measures of mobility, balance, and cognitive function.

NCT02637791,"Stroke is the third most common cause of mortality and the leading cause of long term disability worldwide with over 900,000 people living in England who have had a stroke. 75% of survivors regain their ability to walk again, however it is estimated that between 55 and 75% fail to regain satisfactory use of their impaired arm. This limits the person's independence, ability to care for themselves and reduces their quality of life. Research indicates that for optimal recovery, high levels of rehabilitation are required yet current provision often fails to meet the required levels of intensity and duration of therapy.

In conjunction with stroke patients, their families and therapists, the team developed a low cost system (the virtual glove) to encourage stroke survivors to practice arm exercises at home. The system tracks infrared light emitting diodes (LEDs) positioned on the fingers turning the hand into a game controller to play games that encourage the movements of reach, grasp and release that underlie activities of daily living.

Before examining its effectiveness, the purpose of the registered study is to determine how feasible a large trial would be in terms of whether sufficient participants could be recruited, whether they would use the glove and whether outcome measures could be collected.

Patients will be recruited if they are aged 18 years or over, are recovering from a stroke, no longer receive any other intensive rehabilitation but still experiencing difficulty using their arm. After baseline measures are collected they will be randomly allocated to either the intervention group or a control group. The intervention group will have the virtual glove and games at home for a period of eight weeks and be advised to use the equipment for 20 minutes, three times a day. The control group will continue to have whatever care they are already receiving but no new interventions.

Outcome measures will be collected at baseline, four weeks and after the equipment has been removed from their home. Outcome measures will include tests of arm function as well participant reports of how often they are using their affected arm and how easy they find activities of daily living. The therapists collecting the outcome measures will not know to which group the participants have been allocated.

NCT03964662,"WeReha is an innovative device for the home rehabilitation of stroke patients developed within the scope of the EU funded project MAGIC-PCP [5]. WeReha is a system that allows patients to perform exercises in a home environment with remote supervision integrated within regular rehabilitation. The principle on which the product is based is that of biofeedback guided rehabilitation, designed to stimulate muscle recovery and contribute to a more effective and more motivating rehabilitation of neuro-motor patterns. WeReha is completely adaptable, allowing only authorized to assign exercises, by planning specific sequences of movements.

WeReha product is composed by the following elements:

a tablet with a proprietary application on it (the ""WeReha app"")
an inertial sensor with accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers (the ""sensor"")
elastic straps allowing the user to wear it on different parts of the body (the ""straps"")
a series of 3D printed objects where the sensor can be placed that become animated (the ""smart objects"")
a web portal for clinical staff through which they can manage and monitor users (the ""web-application"") The WeReha app presents the patient with a series of rehabilitation exercises in the form of a number of interactive games, driven by body movement, which is captured by the sensor or the hand specific movements using the smart objects. A session with WeReha always starts with a questionnaire on the system, through which the software gains an understanding of the patient's health conditions and the presence or not of a caregiver for the session. Based on this questionnaire, the software adapts the daily session to minimise risks while maintaining a high level of rehabilitation to help the patient reach their goals. The device works with and without an internet connection, but when the device is connected to the internet, supervisors are able to provide supervision and remote support through a web application.

The web application is hosted on a dedicated server located inside the hospital. Only trained staff will be provided with access to the web application with a unique username and password required for sign on. The exercises assigned for the client to perform at home, are at the discretion of the clinician who is caring for the patient and might require the presence of a caregiver.

The goal of this study is to investigate the applicability and utility of an innovative technology product such as WeReha to the home rehabilitation of stroke patients as an integrative solution to a conventional exercise program and to assess its acceptance by the patient, caregivers and clinic professionals.

Patients will use WeReha for their home rehabilitation in addition to traditional treatments for up to 12 weeks. The Inclusion criteria for the study have been kept broad in order to assess these factors on a large enough scale, so as not to limit the usage of the device to a specific sub-group of patients. If patients enrolled are in a subacute phase (i.e. within the first 6 months after the stroke onset), they will be enrolled before leaving the hospital or the rehabilitation department and reaching their home. If patients are considered to be in their chronic phase (i.e. over 6 months after stroke onset), they will be enrolled during an outpatient treatment or on a volunteer basis.

Before starting the trial with WeReha, every patient enrolled will receive proper training from a person dedicated to the project (who will be referred to as the ""dedicated figure"") appointed by the hospital and financially supported by the sponsor of the study."

NCT03431402,"Background and Rationale:

Cerebrovascular disease is always ranked at the top causes of death and most of hospitalized acute stroke patients have ischemic stroke [1].

Although the mortality rate of acute ischemic stroke is less than that of hemorrhagic stroke [1], it still results in patient disabilities and complications that often lead to significant costs to individuals, families, and society.

Traditional treatment for acute ischemic stroke includes thrombolytic therapy by injecting tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) within three hours after onset of symptoms [2], antiplatelets and/or anticoagulant agents administered within the first 48 hours. Clinically, the narrow time window of thrombolytic therapy and coexisting contraindications limit the use of t-PA [2]. Thus, searching for an effective supplemental treatment for acute ischemic stroke is imperative.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is valuable in treating acute carbon monoxide poisoning [3,4], air or gas embolism [5], facilitating wound healing [6] and has been used as an adjuvant treatment for many neurological disorders that need further study as concussion [7] , stroke [8,9], cerebral palsy [ 10],traumatic brain injury [ 11], cerebral air embolism [12], Autism [13] and multiple sclerosis [14].

Indications of hyperbaric oxygen therapy recommended by undersea and hyperbaric medical society (UHMS) [15] are 1.air or gas embolism [5], 2.carbon monoxide poisoning [3,4], 3.clostridial myositis and myonecrosis [16], 4.crush injury, compartment syndrome and other acute traumatic ischemias [17], 5.decompression sickness [18], 6.arterial insufficiencies [19], 7.severe anemia [20], 8.intracranial abscess [21], 9.necrotizing soft tissue infections [22],10. refractory osteomyelitis [23], 11.delayed radiation injury [24], 12.compromised grafts and flaps [25], 13.acute thermal burn injury [26] and 14.idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss [27].

Known mechanisms of HBOT-induced neuroprotection include enhancing neuronal viability via increased tissue oxygen delivery to the area of diminished blood flow, reducing brain edema, and improving metabolism after ischemia [28,29]. Furthermore, a recent study performed on a rat suggested that upregulation of the expression of glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) might underlie the effect of HBOT [30].

NCT03266952,"Enrollment of a population-based, prospective cohort of 3298 stroke-free adults was completed in 2001 and annual follow-up has continued since then. This collaborative study is the first prospective cohort study among whites, blacks and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same community. This grant supports continued follow-up and outcome detection and expansion of data collection in this cohort. The aims are to evaluate the relationship between vascular outcomes (stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and vascular death) and insulin resistance, carotid intima-media thickness, carotid distensibility, and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of vascular subclinical brain disease and to determine if MRI subclinical disease accounts for race/ethnic differences in cognitive impairment. To accomplish these aims further data collection using the population-based, prospective cohort study is proposed. Stored baseline serum will be used to measure fasting insulin levels to evaluate insulin resistance. High-resolution carotid imaging data will be collected at subsequent visits to expand the measurements of subclinical carotid disease to 1300 subjects. MRIs and a neuropsychological battery emphasizing frontal executive domains will be done on 1300 subjects and quantitative analyses performed to measure white matter hyperintensities, silent infarcts, and silent cerebral microbleeds.

Starting in 2005, subjects enrolled in the MRI substudy began to have echocardiograms and 24hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Subjects will be followed by annual telephone interviews to ascertain stroke, MI, death, and changes in cognitive state. In-person assessment will be done for all subjects who screen positive. Community stroke surveillance will be maintained to insure stroke detection among the cohort. Specific diagnostic committees classify stroke, MI and vascular death."

NCT03724318,"Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder that often occurs after heart surgery. During atrial fibrillation blood cloths may form, predominantly in the left atrial appendage, a small sac in the wall of the left side of the heart. Some heart surgeons close this appendage to protect against stroke, particularly in patients with a history of atrial fibrillation, yet there is little evidence to support the efficacy and safety of this practice.

We therefore conducted the Left Atrial Appendage Closure by Surgery (LAACS) study (2010-2016) were patients in whom the appendage was closed (by chance) suffered fewer brain damages that patients where it remained open. Although encouraging, these results were not only based on strokes, but also on scars without symptoms found in brain scans. The following LAACS-2 study will include a sufficient number of patients to determine whether future guidelines should advise to close systematically the left atrium appendage during a heart operation."

NCT03153683,"This is a prospective open enrollment registry to evaluate arterial blood and thrombus removed during the standard thrombectomy procedure, which will then be used for the purposes of identifying biological markers, inflammatory cell infiltrates, and biological states in large vessel occlusive stroke in the human condition. The primary objectives are to evaluate the feasibility of obtaining distal clot blood during thrombectomy; develop a group of biosamples (blood and clots) to evaluate novel proteins, cell types, and cytokines in acute ischemic stroke in the human condition, and evaluate specific biomarkers, proteins, and leukocyte populations in stroke in the human condition. The study population will include up to 250 subjects. Male and female participants 18 years of age and older will be enrolled. Participants must have had a suspected acute ischemic stroke based on clinical and radiographic evidence as determined and documented by the Stroke Neurology team at University of Kentucky. There is no therapeutic intervention involved in this study.

This is the first study to our knowledge that will utilize thrombectomy technique to collect focal blood samples and the clot related brain infarction. This proposal will provide preliminary data needed to understand relationships between the local inflammatory cascade and clinical variables such as age, gender, time from symptoms to thrombectomy, and stroke imaging results. Characterizing these relationships is vital in the formulation of related therapeutics. Issues of gender-differences, age-based variations, and co-morbidities all engender heterogeneity, which plague translation of stroke research from animal to human. By starting with the human condition, the investigators aim to minimize this loss in translation. Overall, this study will have a great impact on our knowledge of stroke pathology. In essence, this could fundamentally change not only how the investigators develop treatment strategies for the stroke patient population but allow us to individualize the treatment dependent on time after stroke, age, sex, and co-morbidities. Molecular techniques that are impractical when delivered systemically could be delivered locally to impede the early inflammation."
NCT05180929,"Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been gaining increasing interest as a potential therapeutic tool to improve upper extremity (UE) rehabilitation outcomes following stroke. Within the concept of interhemispheric inhibition (IHI), most tDCS studies have applied anodal ipsilesional and/or cathodal contralesional primary motor cortex (M1) tDCS to rebalance IHI and enhance motor recovery. However, compelling evidence suggests that an excitation/inhibition model is oversimplified, and the role of both hemispheres in the encoding of information during motor learning should be acknowledged. Moreover, multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated the potential relevance of contralesional premotor cortex (PMC) for recovery after M1 injury.

Objective: We are aiming to investigate and compare the eﬀects of two tDCS montages at different cortical sites (Dual-M1 vs. a-tDCS over contralesional PMC) by measuring the clinical outcomes of the most affected UE in patients with chronic subcortical stroke.

Methods: 35 participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups (Group A received dual- M1 tDCS, Group B received a-tDCS over contralesional PMC, and Group C received sham stimulation). tDCS will be applied using intensity of 2 mA for 20 min. (5 times/week) for 2 consecutive weeks. Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) and Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) will be used to quantify the UE functional motor ability. Box and Block Test (BBT) will be used for gross manual dexterity and Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT) will be used to measure fine hand dexterity. All measurements will be taken pre-treatment (T0) and post-treatment (T1) immediately after the 10th session, then 4 weeks after the end of stimulation period (T2) to assess the long-term effects.

Expected results: This study would verify whether enhancing the motor cortical hyperexcitability in the contralesional hemisphere has a beneficial on recovery of the paretic hand, or regaining the balance of transcallosal inhibitory circuits between the motor areas in both hemispheres has more positive effects on the motor outcomes . This study would also provide a predictive approach to enable realistic rehabilitation goal-setting by identifying the proper tDCS montage for patients with stroke depending on their impairment level."
NCT04984239,"The proposed study is a Stage I successive cohort trial intended to adapt Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) to meet the specific needs of stroke survivors with aphasia (""ACT for Aphasia"").

NCT03618069,"Stroke affects over 125,000 people each year in the UK and leaves at least 50% disabled. After a first stroke, there is a significant risk of recurrence (around 5-10% over the first year). While there are benefits from addressing general risk factors such as exercise, weight and smoking, selecting the best treatments for preventing a further stroke depends on understanding the underlying mechanism. Most strokes results from a blood clot causing a blockage in a blood vessel in the brain (""ischaemic"" strokes, about 85% of cases). The clot may originate in the heart, the major blood vessels supplying the head, or result from disease of the small blood vessels in the brain itself (around 25% of cases each), and in around 25% of people a cause cannot be determined (sometimes because more than one exists). Different treatments are given depending on cause (for example, anticoagulant medication for clots from the heart, surgery for some arising from large arteries in the neck).

Current investigations involve multiple tests spread across different hospital departments, and commonly take several weeks to be completed. This may contribute to a high rate of strokes of uncertain cause, and may delay the start of the best treatment.

This trial will investigate the value of a single comprehensive scan to look at the heart and major blood vessels (using CT scanning) in a pilot study, comparing the classification of causes of stroke and the time to starting treatments with routine care, in a randomised study of patients with recent stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA, a short-lived stroke episode)."

The investigators hypothesize that the specific rehabilitation associated with acetylcholinestrase inhibitors treatment will focalize cerebral activation observed in fMRI, improve executive functions specifically, improve non trained cognitive functions (generalization effect)."
NCT03815266,"Although the mirror therapy is recognized as effective, its practice is difficult, especially with hemiplegic patients. It is difficult for them to understand, control the movements and carry out a double task with the two upper limbs. The implementation of a Computerized Mirror Therapy (CMT) with the Intensive Visual Simulation 3 (IVS3) device makes it possible to limit these problems by proposing pre-recorded sessions, not limited to the right or left hemi-space, and proposing a work on proximal motricity. Since the functional prognosis of the upper hemiplegic limb remains mostly unfavourable, a wide range of interventions should be proposed. There is currently a consensus to consider the use of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) stimulation in functional recovery after stroke as a method to enhance the effectiveness of training techniques. Although all motor therapies can theoretically benefit from increased effectiveness by the addition of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), Computerized Mirror Therapy (CMT) has a high potential for sensitivity to transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) due to the intensity of the motor training of the upper limb applied."

NCT03814460,"Spasticity is defined as a state of increased muscle tone, which evokes an increased resistance to a passive and fast stretching of the muscle. Indeed, the degree of spasticity depends, among other things, on the stretching velocity performed to the muscle. However, most of the tools used in the clinical setting to assess spasticity do not take into account the relationship between increased muscle tone and speed of stretching. Instead of that, muscle tone is usually assessed in a relaxed position of the muscle.

In addition to rTMS alone for the improvement of depression, the question arises as to whether a combination therapy of rTMS plus antidepressant medication can achieve a stronger or longer-term effect in PSD patients. Unfortunately, there are currently no trials of combination therapy with rTMS and drug therapy in PSD patients. Therefore, this study will investigate whether combination therapy of antidepressant and rTMS can provide additional relief of depressive symptoms compared to antidepressant and sham rTMS therapy. It is assumed that the additional active rTMS achieves a faster normalization of affect and drive than with a sham rTMS, so that the patients benefit from neurorehabilitation measures earlier and more sustainably."
NCT03759691,"Stroke is the second-leading cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of long-term disability. Annually 12,000 people in Denmark suffers a stroke; half of them will have long-term disabilities that may affect the activities of daily living. In addition to substantial individual suffering, stroke is also associated with considerable costs to society. Acute reperfusion therapies started within 4.5 to 6 hours (in some up to 24 hours) from symptom onset for acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) have revolutionized the acute stroke treatment and considerably improved the overall prognosis and mortality. However, only 15-25% of Danish patients are eligible to acute treatment. Numerous attempts to reduce both prehospital and in-hospital delay in stroke have been made, but much time is still lost in the prehospital phase.

Many stroke patients do not recognize their own symptoms as signs of a stroke or do not understand the importance of calling Emergecy Medical Services (EMS) immediately. Others cannot call for help unless they have a bystander, because of cognitive impairment or aphasia. Some patients have a wait-and-see attitude, contact their GP or out-of-hours GP, which also can increase the delay. Educational stroke campaigns can increase knowledge, improve help-seeking behaviour and increase the number of patients eligible for reperfusion therapies. The foundation TrygFonden is planning a national stroke campaign in 2019.

Aims:

To explore the knowledge of stroke in stroke patients and bystanders.
To explore the process from onset of symptoms until admission to hospital and the reasons for prehospital delay.
To explore the association between stroke knowledge, help-seeking behaviour and receiving revascularization therapy.
To evaluate the immediate effect of the national campaign six months after initiation.

Material and methods:

Study 1:

Structured interviews of stroke patients (and bystanders) admitted to the Department of Neurology at Aarhus University Hospital and Regional Hospital West Jutland (Holstebro). The investigators will use the patient's medical record (EPJ) and the Danish Stroke Register (DSR) and map the patient's route from onset of symptoms to admission to stroke centre, including contact to general practitioner (GP), out-of-hours GP or Emergency Medical Services (EMS). For patients who have been in contact with their GP, the GP will receive an electronic questionnaire to explore the time- and event pathway from first contact until admitting the patient to hospital. The investigators will interview 500 patients and approximately 300 bystanders over a period of 3 months.

Study 2:

The investigators will evaluate the effect of the national stroke campaign by conducting a similar study in 2020 when the campaign has been running for six months.

Perspectives:

This study will provide new information about stroke patients and bystanders, their knowledge of stroke and their help-seeking behaviour. If more knowledge about the factors that cause prehospital delay in stroke treatment are obtained, the investigators will know which areas to focus on in the future to improve the outcome for stroke patients. Part of this project will examine the effect of TrygFondens national stroke campaign, which is expected to have impact on general knowledge and help-seeking behaviour. If more people know the core symptoms of stroke, hopefully more people will also know how to react to these symptoms by calling EMS. This will eventually increase reperfusion therapy rates, considerably improve stroke morbidity and mortality and reduce both individual suffering and the societal costs."
NCT03759145,"Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide.Hemiplegia, weakness of one side of the body, is a common consequence of stroke that can lead to significant functional impairments. Loss of arm function occurs in up to 85% of stroke survivors. The impact of arm-related limitations on activities of daily living, leisure activities or work is significant as the arm plays a central role in a person's life from the ability to perform basic activities of daily life to carrying out family and social roles. Guidelines indicate that rehabilitation can improve upper extremity (UE) motor control and functional status post stroke. Virtual reality (VR) and computer games are recent technologies that, as they become more accessible and affordable,are increasingly being used in rehabilitation to allow patients to engage in repetitive practice of specific tasks. A number of published reviews and meta-analyses have examined the use of VR and video games for post-stroke rehabilitation, focusing on or including UE rehabilitation. The authors agree that there is limited but promising findings that VR and video-games, when combined with traditional rehabilitation, have a positive impact on recovery post-stroke."

This study examines the impact of these interventions on fall risk and on a range of important aspects of balance including overall mobility, quality of life, and health. Participants will be 60-69 adults who had a stroke more than 6 months ago and who ambulate independently. Each participant will complete 14 sessions consisting of 4 (2 pre-, 2 post-) testing sessions and 10 intervention sessions. The pre and post testing will be the same and will consist of clinical and survey based balance and quality of life assessments and treadmill based perturbed gait testing.

The pretest will be sessions 1 and 2 will be followed by 10 intervention sessions. There will be 3 treatment groups: a conventional balance training group (PT), a reactive slip training group (Slip), and a multidirectional harness group (MHG). Participants will be randomly assigned to a group following screening and consent.

The conventional balance training group (PT) will receive 10 sessions of individualized standard of care physical therapy with the goal of improving balance and mobility. The only instructions to the PT are that the focus of the course of care should be on ""balance and mobility"" and that there should be 10 sessions.

The reactive slip training group (Slip) will complete a standing slip session using the current protocol of scaling slip distance and force to each individual and modulating the slip intensity across the session based on subject responses. The remaining nine intervention sessions will consist of accompanied walking for up to 45 minutes. Participants will walk at a comfortable pace while accompanied by a researcher.

The multidirectional harness group (MHG) will use a harness that allows movement in all directions, playing selected Kinect™ active video games with varied balance demands, on multiple balance training surfaces (e.g., rocker board, foam, slider platform). Participants will wear the fall-arresting harness for all game play. Motion data will be collected during Sessions 2, 6, and 10.

For all groups, two-post-test sessions will follow the intervention sessions and will be the same as the two-pretest session. The final session will also include reviewing the participants' falls diaries and setting up procedures for contacting participants weekly or biweekly about falls."

NCT04698031,"Silent brain infarctions (SBIs) are a manifestation of covert cerebrovascular disease, without obvious clinical deficit, noted very often in patients presenting with a new stroke or new transient ischemic attack. SBIs are linked to a significant increase in risk for subsequent stroke and cognitive decline. However, no biomarker is currently available that can predict the recurrence of these subclinical lesions. Coated-platelets are a measure of platelet procoagulant potential significantly increased in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack compared to unaffected controls. Higher coated-platelet levels are strongly associated with both the presence and number of SBIs. Among medications approved for preventing stroke recurrence, we identified clopidogrel as a pharmacological agent leading to a decrease in coated-platelet levels. In this project, we plan to evaluate if clopidogrel can decrease the rate of occurrence of new silent brain infarctions.

NCT05179473,"Spasticity, or greater muscle resistance, is a major disabling condition following stroke. Recovery of lost motor function in patients with stroke may be affected by spasticity, which most commonly develops in elbow and ankle muscles. However, despite its clinical relevance, the natural development of spasticity over the first 3 months after stroke is not clearly understood. Indeed, common clinical measures of spasticity such as the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) do not take into account the neurophysiological origin of spasticity and lack reliability and objectivity.

The objective of this study is to examine the natural history of the development of spasticity among patients with stroke over the first 3 months using a new neurophysiological measure (TSRT, the tonic stretch reflex threshold angle) and its velocity sensitivity (mu) in comparison to MAS and other common clinical tests. In addition, detailed brain imaging will be used to understand the relationship between damage to brain regions relevant to the development of spasticity and TSRT/mu values.

It is hypothesized that 1) TSRT/mu will indicate the presence of spasticity earlier than MAS/clinical tests; 2) TSRT/mu measures will be more closely related to motor impairments and activity limitations than MAS; 3) the lesion severity (identified by imaging) will be related to the change in TSRT/mu values.

Outcomes will be measured in a pilot cohort of 12 patients hospitalized for first-ever stroke. Measurements will be taken at the bedside within the 1st week of the patient's admission and will be done once per week for 12 weeks with a follow-up at week 16. Brain Imaging will be done around the 6th week post-stroke."

NCT04752982,"Spatial neglect is a common post-stroke condition in which people may not be aware of anything on one side of the world (usually the same side they lost their movement). Currently, there is no effective treatment for spatial neglect. A therapy called SIGHT (Spatial Inattention Grasping Home-based Therapy) has shown early evidence of improving stroke survivors' spatial neglect (Rossit et al., 2019). SIGHT involves individuals picking-up and balance wooden rods with their less affected hand, independently, without the need for a therapist present at all times. Working with stroke survivors, carers and clinicians we have developed of a computerized version of SIGHT (c-SIGHT; Morse et al., in press).

NCT02563431,"About 70% of hemiplegic patients suffer from hemiplegic shoulder pain after stroke. This common occurrence is a cause for concern in the rehabilitation setting as it leads to impairment of functional outcomes induced by discomfort and delays in rehabilitation, important psycho-emotional repercussions as there is a correlation between upper arm pain and depression, a longer hospital stay. Poor management of hemiplegic shoulder pain can ultimately give rise to type 1 ""complex regional pain syndrome"" (CRPS I).

There are few studies evaluating the effects of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) in individuals with OSA and the findings regarding the possible effect on Apneia/Hipopneia Index (AHI) reduction are still controversial.

This study will test the hypothesis that training of the inspiratory muscles is effective in improving severity of OSA, sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in individuals after stroke participating in a rehabilitation program.

Methods: For this prospective, sigle blinded, randomized clinical trial, people after stroke will be randomly allocated into either experimental or control groups. The experimental group will undertake training of the inspiratory muscles with the PowerBreath Medic Plus regulated at 75% of the subjects' maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) values, five times/week over five weeks 5 sets of 5 repetitions with 1 set increasing each week.

NCT04885257,"Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have an increased risk of developing ischemic stroke. Veterans enduring PTSD face difficulties in managing their PTSD severity after suffering from a stroke. Currently, clinical trials in PTSD exclude patients with stroke and patients with significant premorbid psychological conditions like PTSD are usually excluded from stroke clinical trials. Methylphenidate (MPH) is a central nervous system stimulant that can improve PTSD symptoms: avoidance behaviors, social withdrawal, hyperarousal, and working memory. MPH can also improve post-stroke outcomes: mood, activities of daily living, and motor functioning. In clinical trials for PTSD or stroke, MPH has been shown to be well-tolerated with minimal adverse events. The high prevalence of PTSD in Veterans with stroke provides strong justification for development of interventions that effectively and simultaneously target both conditions. The overarching goal of our proposal is to understand how MPH improves PTSD severity in Veterans with comorbid stroke."
NCT04987255,"Sedentary behaviour is particularly high among the older and in the presence of a chronic pathology. Physical activity is limited mainly by the lack of accessibility to activities offered in the city and the lack of motivation.

NCT05102812,"Current evidence shows that many people living with stroke experience major problems with eating and drinking. We know that this can lead to malnutrition, dehydration, reduced muscle strength and depression. It can also lead to longer stays in hospital, reduced ability to participate in rehabilitation and in the long term poorer quality of life. People living with stroke say the pleasure gained from eating and drinking changes after a stroke. They describe feeling embarrassed and ashamed and report a loss of self-confidence.

Therefore, being able to eat and drink independently is essential for health and well-being. People with stroke welcome opportunities to address eating and drinking problems early in their rehabilitation and would like more opportunities to practice the necessary skills needed, to regain independence. Early rehabilitation interventions have the potential to improve long-term outcomes by providing strategies, assistive devices and rehabilitation as early as possible in stroke recovery.

Health care professionals are using breakfast groups to provide opportunities to practice preparation and consumption of food and drink with enabling support. Consultations with patients and health care professionals have found that the processes involved in breakfast group interventions lack rigour and multi-disciplinary team coordination, thus leading to uncertainty about what outcomes are achieved for each patient.

This co-designed study aims to find out if it is possible to improve patient outcomes by providing more intensive interventions in a breakfast group format delivered by a range of health care professionals over five days of the week. The intervention will be co-designed with a stakeholder group comprising of patients, carers and stroke unit health care professionals supported by an advisory group, comprising of experts in the field. The intervention will be delivered in three sites and it will include a tool kit to support the integrated assessment, care plan and outcome measures."
NCT04099511,"The long-term goal of this research is to improve activity performance and reduce motor impairment in individuals with stroke. Contemporary stroke rehabilitation focuses on remediation of post-stroke impairments with a false assumption that reduction in impairments will automatically lead to improvements in activity performance. Specifically, stroke rehabilitation is focused primarily on the use of task-specific training (TST), which recent research has found to yield negligible improvement in upper extremity motor function often consistent with or less than control conditions. These protocols are time intensive and often do not lead to transfer of training effects to improvement in activity performance. This is a common issue that has been evidenced in longitudinal studies of individuals with stroke; over half of stroke survivors continue to be dependent on others for the most basic of life activities after rehabilitation. Decreases in activity performance further contribute to lower life satisfaction, quality of life, and participation in daily life. The goal of this proposed project is to evaluate the efficacy of a clinically-feasible metacognitive strategy training (MCST) intervention, the Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP) approach, to improve activity performance and reduce stroke impairment for individuals with sub-acute stroke.

Recent evidence highlights two primary issues in stroke rehabilitation. 1) Interventions are needed that directly target activity performance. Gains in upper extremity function, even using the most contemporary approaches, are not translating to meaningful gains in activity performance. 2) Interventions need to be clinically feasible for future implementation. In recent stroke rehabilitation clinical trials, participants received an average of over 30 hours of therapy in only one treatment modality. Individuals in stroke rehabilitation receive a median of only 6 outpatient visits across all health care specialties combined (OT, PT, SLP, physiatrist).

Metacognitive strategy training (MCST), specifically the Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP) approach, is a potential solution to address both of these gaps. CO-OP is a performance-based, problem-solving approach that enables participants to improve task performance through cognitive strategy use. In the exploratory clinical trial for individuals with sub-acute stroke (n=26), the study compared ten, 45-minute sessions of MCST (CO-OP) with dose-matched outpatient usual care outpatient occupational therapy (OT). The MCST (CO-OP) group demonstrated a large effect over usual care on objective measures of trained functional activities (d=1.6) and untrained functional activities (d = 1.1). The MCST group also demonstrated a moderate effect over usual care outpatient OT on improving motor function (r = 0.3).

The goal of this proposed project is to determine the efficacy of MCST to improve activity performance and to reduce motor impairments in individuals with subacute stroke. A single-blind, parallel, randomized clinical trial will be conducted with individuals with sub-acute stroke. Participants will be randomized to a 10-session MCST (CO-OP) treatment group or to a dose matched usual care outpatient OT control group. Data will be collected pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at 3-months post-intervention assessment. Our central research hypothesis is that MCST will produce a significant improvement on objective and subjective measures of activity performance (trained and untrained goals) and reduce motor impairment in comparison to a usual care OT group.

Objective 1: Evaluate the efficacy of MCST to improve subjective and objective activity performance in individuals with subacute stroke.

Primary Endpoint: MCST will have a greater positive effect compared to usual care OT on subjective and objective activity performance of trained goals.

Primary Endpoint: MCST will have a greater positive effect compared to usual care OT on subjective and objective activity performance of untrained activity goals to demonstrate transfer of the treatment effect.

Secondary Endpoint: MCST will have a greater positive effect compared to usual care OT on subjective stroke recovery (participation and role functioning) Objective 2: Evaluate the efficacy of MCST to improve motor function in individuals with subacute stroke.

NCT01688570,"While baseline weakness is clearly an important factor that contributes to disability post stroke, neuromuscular fatigue (the acute reduction in force production) of the paretic musculature likely compounds strength deficits and further exacerbates disability. The proposed study aims to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of neuromuscular fatigue in people post stroke in order to optimize strength training. In healthy individuals, both central (neural) and peripheral (muscle) factors are determinants of neuromuscular fatigue, but preliminary data from our laboratory suggests a greater contribution of central components to neuromuscular fatigue in the paretic musculature. Although cortical pathways are clearly disrupted post stroke, it is likely that brainstem pathways, known to have neuromodulatory effects on spinal motor circuitry, are more involved in the sustaining of force in the paretic leg, compared to the non-paretic and control legs. Therefore, the purpose of this proposal is to examine the role of descending neuromodulatory pathways of the brainstem in neuromuscular fatigue post stroke (Aim 1) and to correlate brainstem-related changes in neuromuscular fatigue to walking function (Aim 2). The investigators propose that stroke survivors' decreased capability to sustain force overtime results from the diminished ability of spinal motoneurons to respond to brainstem neuromodulatory inputs (serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE)). Aim 1 will quantify stroke-related decreases in motor output sensitivity to a 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), serotonin antagonist, or placebo during sub-maximal intermittent fatiguing knee extension contractions. If motoneurons are desensitized to descending monoamines in chronic stroke patients, then they will be less sensitive to the effects of drugs that increase monoamine levels. The investigators predict that in response to the SNRI or serotonin antagonist, the paretic leg will show less change in time to task failure and a smaller reduction in strength as compared to the non-paretic and control legs. For Aim 2, the investigators predict that stroke subjects with the highest walking function will demonstrate the greatest fatigue-related changes in response to the SNRI. This proposal adopts an innovative model of motor impairment post stroke by including the role of subcortical structures in neuromuscular fatigue."

Recent development of technologies may provide more accessible, efficient, objective, intensive and predictive methods compared to traditional practices in facilitating the process of recovery after brain injury and standardizing stroke rehabilitation programs.

A clinical quality improvement program named Accelerated Stroke Ambulation Program (ASAP) was started in Stroke Rehabilitation Program Tai Po Hospital by Physiotherapy Department since 2019, pilot period from October 2019 to September 2020 and execute as standard practice afterward."
NCT03230695,Stroke is the second cause of death worldwide and the majority of the survivors remain with motor impairments. Inhibition of the motor cortex of the unaffected hemisphere has emerged as a potential intervention to enhance effects of other rehabilitation strategies on improvement of motor performance of the paretic upper limb. In this proof-of-concept study we will evaluate the effects of inhibition of the motor cortex of the unaffected hemisphere associated with robotic therapy on improvement of motor performance of the paretic upper limb in the early phase post-stroke.

NCT05420857,"Stroke is the leading cause of serious long-term disability in the United States. Walking speed is related to stroke severity and how well someone can return to community life. Biofeedback is a useful method for increasing walking speed in persons post-stroke, however, these methods are typically limited to laboratory settings. The objective of this research is to determine the short-term response and training potential of a novel, wearable device that provides visual feedback of hip extension during unconstrained over ground walking. The aims of this study are to 1) determine short-term effects of visual biofeedback on biomechanical outcomes, 2) determine the short-term effects of visual biofeedback on gait symmetry during overground walking in individuals post-stroke. The investigators hypothesize that biomechanical and spatiotemporal outcomes will improve following training with the wearable biofeedback device. To assess these aims, participants' gait biomechanics will be assessed pre- and post-training with the biofeedback device as well as 24-hours following the training. Walking speed (primary outcome) as well as hip extension angle, propulsive force, step width, step length, and step time will be assessed to determine changes in performance with use of the device. By understanding short-term responses to this novel training paradigm, research can begin assessing the potential of wearable biofeedback devices in improving gait in persons post-stroke. Should this training prove successful, this study will provide the necessary feasibility data to motivate a larger scale, case-control clinical trial to determine efficacy of the device and training."

NCT02674490,"The investigators will study the effects of transcranial direct current (tDCS) stimulation during language therapy for naming in individuals with aphasia in the acute and subacute post stroke period. Naming difficulties are a persistent and common symptom in aphasia after left-hemisphere (LH) stroke. Behavioral therapy (speech and language therapy; SALT) is the mainstay treatment for post stroke aphasia. Transcranial direct cortical stimulation (tDCS) is a promising adjunct to traditional SALT. tDCS is a safe, non-invasive, non-painful electrical stimulation of the brain which modulates cortical excitability by application of weak electrical currents in the form of direct current brain polarization. It is usually administered via saline-soaked surface sponge electrodes attached to the scalp and connected to a direct current stimulator with low intensities. Most studies are conducted in the chronic phase after stroke. Because neuroplasticity is greatest early after stroke, there is reason to believe tDCS might be most effective in the acute-subacute period. However, only two studies have evaluated tDCS paired with language therapy in group studies of acute to subacute aphasic stroke patients and only one of these was sham-controlled. Furthermore, no studies (of which we are aware) have combined tDCS with therapy to facilitate naming in post stroke aphasia, as shown to be effective in studies of chronic stroke. In this study, the investigators will evaluate whether tDCS combined with SALT improves naming in individuals with aphasia in the acute and subacute post stroke period, more than SALT alone in a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial. The investigators will test the hypothesis that anodal tDCS (A-tDCS) over a targeted region and computer-delivered SALT is associated with greater gains in accuracy in naming pictures, compared to sham combined with the same computer-delivered SALT in post stroke aphasia."
NCT03569059,"This study investigates the effects of intensive, high dosage task and impairment based training of the hemiparetic hand, using haptic robots integrated with complex gaming and virtual reality simulations. There is a time-limited period of post-ischemic heightened neuronal plasticity during which intensive training may optimally affect the recovery of motor skills, indicating that the timing of rehabilitation is as important as the dosing. However, recent literature indicates a controversy regarding both the value of intensive, high dosage as well as the optimal timing for therapy in the first two months after stroke. This study is designed to empirically investigate this controversy. It is evident that providing additional, intensive therapy during the acute rehabilitation stay is more complicated to implement and difficult for patients to tolerate, than initiating it in the outpatient setting, immediately after discharge. The robotic/VR system is specifically designed to deliver hand and arm training when motion and strength are limited, using adaptive algorithms to drive individual finger movement, gain adaptation and workspace modification to increase finger and arm range of motion, and haptic and visual feedback from mirrored movements to reinforce motor networks in the lesioned hemisphere."
NCT01787877,"Stroke represents the third commonest cause of death after heart disease and all types of cancer combined, and is the leading cause of long-term permanent disability among adults. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is currently the only safe medical treatment for acute ischemic stroke but only a small fraction of patients are eligible for a thrombolysis treatment. Current guidelines on thrombolysis post stroke with tPA exclude its uses beyond 3 hours after stroke onset and when time of onset is unknown thus excluding many patients from potentially beneficial treatment.

For an appropriate triage and management of patients, it is essential to improve imaging techniques beyond a simple CT scan. Perfusion computed tomography (PCT), currently considered as an investigational technique, permits a quantitative determination of the cerebral perfusion within the brain. It helps distinguish salvageable ischemic penumbra from irreversibly infarcted core in acute stroke patients. This technique has therefore the potential to select patients who are most likely to benefit from thrombolysis with tPA, can be used to predict the benefit after thrombolysis and determine the suitability for other therapeutic interventions. In patients with a primary diagnosis of TIA, PCT would help to identify possible persistent cerebral ischemia but also provide important information for rapid instigation of prophylactic strategies.

The diagnosis and management of patients with ischemic stroke and TIA is challenging and is primarily based on clinical assessment in conjunction with neuroimaging. Development of specific molecular biomarkers as additional tools to support a clinical diagnosis, exclude common stroke mimics such as migraine or epileptic seizures, identify patients at risk of disease, and help guide patient treatment by predicting complications following t-PA treatment would be of great value."
NCT04746157,"Stroke is the second single most common cause of death and the main cause of disability in the European Union (EU) region. Stroke victims face an uncertain future and a life severely affected by disability.

NCT04361552,This phase III trial compares the effect of adding tocilizumab to standard of care versus standard of care alone in treating cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. CRS is a potentially serious disorder caused by the release of an excessive amount of substance that is made by cells of the immune system (cytokines) as a response to viral infection. Tocilizumab is used to decrease the body's immune response. Adding tocilizumab to standard of care may work better in treating CRS in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to standard of care alone.
NCT04694833,"After a stroke, individuals present with motor and/or cognitive impairments. These impairments limit activity, restrict participation and affect quality of life. Therefore, rehabilitation programs are provided from the earliest days. However, an important proportion of patients do not achieve the recommended amount of rehabilitation therapy (even in institutional systems). In fact, patients do not always have access to healthcare systems. Moreover, hospital resources and healthcare systems are often limited (especially in poor countries) which has led to the development of new cost-effective rehabilitation methods such as self-rehabilitation and tele-rehabilitation.

This study aims :

to develop and validate relevant self-assessments tools in virtual reality
to propose auto-adaptative virtual reality-based therapies based on the link between motor and cognitive functions."

The investigators believe this aftercare could be better coordinated by a specialized coordinated stroke aftercare service. Comprehensive coordinated multidisciplinary care is a proven concept with proven benefits in both acute and rehabilitation care provided in stroke units and neurorehabilitation centres.

NCT04661891,"The purpose of this study is to develop a real-time controller for exoskeletons using neural information embedded in human musculature. This controller will consist of an online interface that anticipates human movement based on high-density electromyography (HD-EMG) recordings, and then translates it into functional assistance. This study will be carried out in both healthy participants and participants post-stroke.

The researchers will develop an online algorithm (decoder) in currently existing exoskeletons that can extract hundreds of motor unit (MU) spiking activity out of HD-EMG recordings. The MU spiking activity is a train of action potentials coded by its timing of occurrence that gives access to a representative part of the neural code of human movement. The researchers will also develop a command encoder that can anticipate human intent (multi-joint position and force commands) from MU spiking activity to translate the neural information to movement. The researchers will integrate the decoder with the command encoder to showcase the real-time control of multiple joint lower-limb exoskeletons."
NCT04808778,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic disease, affecting about 25 million people worldwide. Approximately 150,000 Nigerian children are born each year with sickle cell disease (SCD), making it the country with the largest burden of SCD in the world. Recent advancements in care for children with SCA have translated into improved survival of children in both high and low-resource settings. However, more complications of SCD are seen in those who survive to adulthood. Silent cerebral infarcts (SCI) and strokes are among the most devastating complications of SCD, affecting 40% and 10% of children, respectively.

The overall goal of this study is to extend the Investigator's successful capacity-building effort in the assessment of neurological morbidity in children with SCD living in northern Nigeria (Kano) to young adults with SCD living in the same region. About 50% of all adults with SCD live in Nigeria. Despite the high prevalence of SCD in Africa, the neurological morbidity is not well characterized, limiting opportunities for primary and secondary stroke prevention strategies. At least 50% of young adults with sickle cell anemia (SCA), the most severe form of the disease, will have SCIs and an estimated 10% will have strokes, based on studies in high-resource settings. In high-resource settings, screening for abnormal transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities in children with SCA, coupled with regular blood transfusion has resulted in a 92% reduction of relative risk for strokes. Despite this effective strategy, regular blood transfusion therapy does not seem sustainable in sub-Saharan Africa due to shortages and the risk of transfusion transmissible infections. Additionally, there is a lack of evidence-based stroke prevention strategies in young adults with SCA, either in the high-income or in low-resource settings. Based on the foregoing, the Investigators propose to determine the prevalence of neurological injury (overt stroke, transient ischemic attacks, and silent cerebral infarcts) in young adults at the transition age from 16-25 years. The Investigators will also, for the first time, assess conventional risk factors of stroke in the general population to determine whether a different prevention strategy is required to reduce the incidence of neurological injury in this high-risk population."

NCT04105257,"When a patient is received with the context of acute stroke, they undergo a fast neurological evaluation and obtain a basic appraisal composed of a non-contrast endovascular cerebral scan and an angiography scan of intracranial blood vessels and the neck. Once the structural lesion (hemorrhage, tumor, etc.) is absent, signs of early infracts and confirmed acute intracranial arterial occlusion, the possibility of a pseudo-stroke dwells in the differential diagnostic.

Certain characteristics of history and clinical evaluation create sufficient doubt to evoke the possibility of a pseudo-stroke. In fact, this population is mostly female and the cardiovascular risk factors are less prevalent in this group than for the group of stroke victims. It is on average the youngest and presents a less severe deficit. For the rest, medical antecedents often help to evoke a diagnosis of pseudo-stroke."

NCT05134454,"Stroke is one of the leading causes behind death and permanent disability in adults. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical arrhythmia and its prevalence is steeply increasing with age. Atrial fibrillation is associated with a manifold increase in the risk for stroke.

It is considered important to investigate the heart rhythm in stroke survivors without previously known AF, because detection of AF will prompt a change in antithrombotic treatment with subsequent lowering of the risk of recurrent stroke.

There are so far very few studies on the prognostic impact of ECG investigations post stroke. Despite this knowledge gap, ECG investigation post stroke is given high priority in national and international guidelines.

Considerable clinical resources are currently invested in these ECG investigations without knowledge of its utility.

The investigators plan a nationwide, randomised, register-based study (RRCT) including patients aged at least 70 years receiving in-hospital care for stroke or TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack). Included patients will be randomised to standard investigation (1-2 days of ECG ) or extended ECG investigation (14 days of ECG performed at least twice).

NCT04330417,"Stroke patients have limited hand mobility post-stroke, thus inhibiting them from performing daily functional tasks independently, resulting in reduced quality of life. Current hand rehabilitation robotic devices are typically driven by rigid linkages/joints, which subject the fingers into a single plane of motion that is unnatural and uncomfortable. These devices belong to the class of continuous passive motion (CPM) devices that only promote hand range-of-motion, but do not require the patient to play an active role in performing the hand exercises. There is a strong need for a device that can resolve the lack of compliant robot-assisted hand motion and lack of intuitive user control in assistive and rehabilitation processes.

This proposed research aims to fill the above-mentioned gaps for current hand rehabilitation devices by developing a soft robotic glove that provides compliant assistance to bidirectional hand motion, coupled with intuitive user control.

In the short term, the robotic glove will likely enhance the patients' hand flexion-extension range of motion and improve the neuro-motor control of the hand.

In the long term, the robotic glove will act as an adjunct to therapists, thereby raising productivity in the presence of growing manpower constraints and optimizing therapy time for the patients; this can potentially enhance recovery time and quality of life, as a result of improved hand mobility for common daily tasks."

NCT02937077,"Background:

Different studies with real-life data and randomized controlled trials have shown a detection rate of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) of 10-20% in patients with cryptogenic stroke using insertable continuous cardiac monitoring for 6 months. More studies are needed, however, to identify factors which can be used to select the patients where the possibility of detecting AF with prolonged rhythm monitoring is highest, to evaluate the best duration of rhythm monitoring, to determine the optimal deﬁnition of short-term AF that warrants intervention and to evaluate whether intervention results in improved clinical outcomes.

Methods: The NOR-FIB study is a multi-centre prospective observational trial, designed to evaluate detection of AF in cryptogenic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). Patients admitted with cryptogenic stroke or TIA in stroke units in the Nordic countries, aged 18-80 years are included and have the Reveal LINQ® Insertable cardiac monitor system implanted for 12 months for the purpose of AF detection. Biomarkers that may identify patients, who could derive the most clinical benefit from the detection of AF by prolonged monitoring, are being studied.

Conclusion: This NOR-FIB study will increase our knowledge regarding the occurrence of AF in patients with cryptogenic stroke and TIA that potentially can improve secondary prevention. The study will provide information on biomarkers that may be used to select cryptogenic TIA and stroke patients for long-term monitoring as well as information on the significance of short-term AF and optimal duration of cardiac rhythm monitoring."

NCT03753555,"Intracranial atherosclerotic disease is the most common cause of ischemic stroke that is directly attributed to the progression or rupture of intracranial high-risk plaque in Asia. Many studies mainly from Euro-American population with a focus on extracranial carotid plaque have fully demonstrated the advantages of intensive statin therapy on stabilizing or reversing plaque burden, reversing plaque composition presenting that lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC) is gradually replaced by fibrous tissue, and even reversing pattern of arterial remodeling to reduce the occurrence of cerebrovascular events. Yet, direct evidence of the effect of intensive statin therapy on intracranial atherosclerotic plaques is lacking and the effect of statin intensity and duration on intracranial plaque burden and composition is still unclear. High resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HRMRI) is a new and non-invasive technique that enable to assess the morphologic characteristics of vascular wall and plaque composition of intracranial artery. Based on above discussion, the investigators conduct this study to further determine the effect of intensive statin in ischemic stroke with intracranial atherosclerotic plaques."
NCT03969511,"Rationale: Acute large-vessel strokes, requiring endovascular treatment, are currently being managed through radiology department before being transferred to the angiography room. However, patients with severe neurological deficit have demonstrated even greater benefits from recanalization as the symptom onset-to-reperfusion time is shortened to less than 1 hour. Recent pilot study have shown a benefit in reducing management delays with direct admission to the angiography room and subsequently in increasing functional independence at 3 months. Therefore, the aim is to demonstrate the superiority of the direct angio-suite transfer versus the standard management, in terms of 3-month functional independence, in patients strongly suspected of having a severe ischemic stroke related to acute large-vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation, and treated by mechanical thrombectomy ± intravenous thrombolysis.

NCT04795362,"Nearly half of the survivors of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) retain irreversible neurological damage resulting from the early lesions associated with the initial bleeding, and the occurrence of possible delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI). The early diagnosis of the occurrence of an DCI is therefore a major challenge in order to optimise management before irreversible lesions are formed. However, the means of diagnosis are often not available, and up to a third of DCI are discovered on follow-up images when the lesions are already present. Among the markers of brain injury, S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) is an astrocyte protein released into the bloodstream at the time of the appearance of a brain lesion. Its short half-life makes it a prime candidate for patient follow-up to diagnose a new ischemic lesion and assess the effectiveness of its management.

Among the elements at the origin of DCI, the occurrence of proximal vasospasm is the main element on which we can have a therapeutic action. The strategy implemented in the department consists of performing a mechanical angioplasty when proximal vasospasm is detected with a decrease in downstream cerebral perfusion. Nevertheless the benefit of this therapeutic action is discussed and there is currently no early marker of the effectiveness of this procedure."
NCT01658293,"Sensory and/or motor deficits in upper limb following stroke often have negative impacts on their daily living. Thermal stimulation with hot and cold pack alternatively incorporated into conventional rehabilitation has been reported and proved to be effective for upper limb functional recovery after stroke. However, whether hot- and cold-water stimulation alternatively based on thermal stimulation also has the effect still remains unknown. The aim of present study is to investigate the facilitated effect of hot and cold water stimulation alternatively on upper limb after stroke."
NCT05213793,"This study explores the value of the non-invasive quantitative evaluation system for cerebral blood flow perfusion function in the diagnosis of stroke.

NCT04588337,"Acute ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke, accounting for about 60%-80% of all stroke, with high incidence, high mortality, high disability rate, has become the first cause of death in China. At present, only ultra-early thrombolytic therapy, endovascular therapy and antiplatelet therapy have obtained evidence-based medical evidence in ischemic stroke treatment, but only thrombolytic therapy and endovascular therapy can improve the good prognosis of patients. Intravenous thrombolytic therapy within 4.5 hours after the onset of ischemic stroke symptoms has been shown to be effective, which is recommended in the guidelines.

In most countries, alteplase (R-tPA) is the only drug approved for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Recombinant human TNK tissue-type plasminogen activator (rhTNK-tPA) is a modified recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, with no procoagulant effect and a longer half life. In recent years, there are some studies on the comparison of therapeutic effects of TNK-tPA and RT-PA in patients with acute ischemic stroke, and TNK shows promising especially for large artery occlussion. At present, there are few reports on the application of rhTNK-tPA in Chinese stroke patients.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rhTNK-tPA in Chinese patients with ischemic stroke in a prospective, multicenter registration study."
NCT02351518,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects 1.5 million patients per year in the United States, resulting in more than 50,000 deaths and more than 230,000 hospitalizations annually. Approximately 90,000 of these patients will suffer permanent impairment and more than half will experience short-term disability.

Secondary injury processes play a critical role in the development of ischemia after trauma to the central nervous system and occur hours-to-days after the primary insult. Ischemia can lead to cerebral infarction or stroke. Ischemia has been described as the single most important secondary insult and has been identified histologically in approximately 90% of patients who die following closed head injury. Several factors resulting in post-traumatic cerebral ischemia have been identified: increased intracranial pressure (ICP), systemic arterial hypotension, and cerebral vasospasm. Cerebral vasospasm has been described as a sustained arterial narrowing. Clinically, the onset of new or worsening neurological symptoms is the most reliable indicator of cerebral vasospasm following a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. However, cerebral vasospasm is often unrecognized in patients suffering from moderate to severe TBI. These patients frequently have altered mental status due to the primary brain injury. In addition, they require narcotics for their pain and paralytics and/or sedatives while on a mechanical ventilator for airway protection. Thus, relying on the neurological exam to observe deteriorating neurological signs consistent with post-traumatic vasospasm (PTV) is reliable. While the etiology and outcome of patients with vasospasm secondary to ruptured aneurysm is well documented, the clinical significance of PTV after TBI is unknown. A better understanding of the role of cerebral autoregulation in the development of cerebral vasospasm could provide the answer. This proposal is for a pilot observational study describing the association of the impairment of cerebral autoregulation as measured by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with the development of clinically significant vasospasm in patients with moderate to severe TBI. The information will serve as preliminary data for further study."

NCT05218135,"Different studies showed large variation between care processes in multiple diseases, which lead to large variation in outcomes. Better adherence to evidence-based guidelines for these diseases can reduce this variation and can improve the health outcomes. Since international studies have demonstrated wide variations in care processes for acute stroke, it would be interesting to repeat these investigations in the population of stroke patients. Worldwide, stroke is a leading cause of disability and death. Every two seconds, someone across the world experiences a symptomatic stroke. 50% of stroke survivors has moderate to severe neurologic deficits, 25% of them depend on others. In Belgium, stroke is one of the most important causes of invalidity. Every year approximately 18 000 people in Belgium experiences a stroke, which results in almost one person every two hours, with a mortality rate of 30%. The world health organization has the ambition to significantly reduce the mortality and risk factors for non-communicable diseases by 2025. The mortality and disability in stroke patients can be reduced by organized stroke care, which includes effective strategies in stroke management, treatment and prevention. Also, other health domains, like functional recovery, healthcare costs and patient satisfaction, were positively related to adherence on stroke guidelines. This evidence had been converted in several clinical guidelines for stroke care. However, the adherence to these guidelines is variable. As already mentioned before, international studies have demonstrated wide variations in care processes for acute stroke. However, a positive relationship has been shown between the implementation of evidence-based clinical guidelines and the quality of stroke care. Therefore, it is important to both implement these guidelines and to improve the adherence to them.

The aim of this study is to map the variation in stroke care in Flemish hospitals and to get an overview about the variation within and between these hospitals. During this study, electronic patient records will be analyzed to check which interventions are performed in a specific patient and of which no information could be found in de patient record."
NCT03220568,"Background: Although low-fat dairy products are an integral part of a diet recommended for stroke prevention, the role of dairy fat in relation to the risk of stroke is not yet clear.

Objective: Therefore the association of adipose tissue content of fatty acids, for which dairy products are a major source (12:0, 14:0, 14:1 cis-9, 15:0, 17:0, 18:1 trans-11 and 18:2 cis-9, trans-11), with incident total stroke and stroke subtypes will be investigated.

Design: The study is a case-cohort study nested within the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort, including all incident stroke cases and a random sample of the total cohort.The fatty acid composition of adipose tissue biopsies was determined by gas chromatography and the content of specific fatty acids was expressed as percentage of total fatty acids. Stroke cases were identified in the Danish National Patient Registry and the diagnoses were individually verified. Cox proportional hazard regression will be used to estimate the association between fatty acids and stroke."

NCT04672044,"There are over 7 million people living with stroke in the United States. Per year, approximately 17,000 Veterans are admitted to the VA for acute stroke. Chronic pain after stroke can occur between 10-50% of stroke survivors. Post-stroke pain (PSP) can lead to further complications in a stroke survivor's recovery. Exercise has improved PSP and associated symptoms such as mobility, fatigue, and quality of life. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive technique using electromagnetic induction for cortical neurostimulation. The use of rTMS has been explored shown to be effective in treating chronic PSP but is limited in effect duration. Our proposal will test the hypothesis that rTMS is feasible and safe to be paired with exercise. Additionally, the investigators believe a complementary effect can develop to enhance the neurostimulation duration of rTMS."
NCT04823481,"Nearly 3% of patients with ischaemic stroke (IS) have an isolated occlusion of the anterior or posterior cerebral artery in the acute phase of the disease. In those patients, intravenous thrombolysis (IT) is indicated for 4.5 hours after symptoms onset. Due to a lack of data, mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is not considered as a gold standard to treat IS alone or in addition with IT. Therefore, observational studies are needed to understand the clinical evolution of patients with IS treated with IT and/or MT. The ACAPULCO retrospective observational study aims to highlight potential benefits of MT in those patients to improve their management and to propose targeted therapies in the future."

NCT01773369,"Early childhood injuries such as perinatal (around birth) stroke are devastating because the child lives with the problem for life, typically close to a normal lifespan. One 'opportunity' presented by a brain injury early in life compared to later in adulthood is that the young brain is much more plastic (malleable) and receptive to interventions. This is particularly true for neural circuits that are still under development. We will test the hypothesis that early (<2 yr old), intensive leg training will improve walking more than no training or training at >2 yr old. We will further determine the changes induced by training in motor and sensory pathways."

All patients will receive the best standard stroke treatment. This includes treating patients with the clot dissolving drug tPA (tissue plasminogen activator). However, t-PA does not work in some patients and others are not eligible to receive t-PA because they present too late for treatment (they woke up with their stroke symptoms or their stroke was not witnessed).

During endovascular revascularization the blockage in the artery is removed with the use of devices called stentreivers and or by giving clot dissolving drug at the site of the blockage in the artery to restore blood flow. Stentrievers are devices that have been designed by different companies to remove blood clots from arteries.

Patients in the RIPC group had five cycles of 5-min cuff inflation followed by 3-min deflation to the bilateral upper arm after thrombolysis. The primary endpoint was the recovery of nerve function deficient assessed by National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS), Activities of Daily Living(ADL), Modified Rankin Scale(mRS), CT cerebral perfusion imaging (CTP) and CT angiography(CTA). Secondary endpoints included the following: angiogenesis assessed by the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)."

NCT04102228,"Many stroke survivors experience aphasia, a loss or impairment of language affecting the production or understanding of speech. One common type of aphasia is known as non-fluent aphasia. Patients with non-fluent aphasia have difficulty formulating grammatical sentences, often producing short word fragments despite having a good understanding of what others are trying to communicate to them. Speech language pathologists (SLPs) play a central role rehabilitating persons with aphasia and administer therapy in an attempt to improve communication skills. Despite standard therapy, approximately 50% of individuals who experience aphasia acutely continue to have language deficits more than 6 months post-stroke.

In most people, Broca's area is dominant in the left side of the brain. Following a left-sided stroke, the right-sided homologue of Broca's area (the pars triangularis), may adopt language function. Unfortunately, reorganizing language to the right side of the brain seems to be less effective than restoring function to the left hemisphere. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, can be used to suppress activity of specific regions in the right side of the brain to promote recovery of function in the perilesional area. Despite preliminary success in existing studies using rTMS in post-stroke aphasia, there is much work to be done to better understand the mechanisms underlying recovery. Responses to rTMS have been positive, yet heterogenous, which may be related to timing of treatments following stroke."

NCT03217279,"The incidence of Stroke in France is about 150 000 per year. Stroke represents the leading cause of long-term disability. The specificity of stroke is the sequelae polymorphism that can occurs: physical disability, cognitive deficit and sensitive trouble. Then this large extend of sequelae may have a different impact on daily life. Therefore, we have to consider the individual's own resources and in his whole environment to face the situation. We suppose that each situation, each post-stroke disability will have a different social impact in stroke survivors and their caregivers. Nowadays, Barthel Index and Rankin scale are the standards for the assessment of the stroke impact on survivors' daily life. However, what is the real impact of an activity limitation in daily life? How consider the psychosocial impact of stroke only with functional indicators? For this study we will consider handicap and disability in a societal way. In fact, the WHO developed in 2001 the International Classification of functioning, disability and health that allows to bring the concept of participation restriction, this is to say the consequences of a disability in the real life. The ICF allows to bring a conceptual framework of participation restriction.

Psychosocial consequences of stroke are relatively unknown especially in France. According to our hypothesis, patients with major disabilities and their caregivers will experience more psychosocial consequences and participation restriction in terms of emotional health, quality of life and burden. Also, we hypothesize that stroke severity, the typology of disabilities (motor, cognitive and sensorial) will have a different impact on patients and proxys' lifes in terms of psychosocial consequences, participation restriction and quality of life.

TYBRA study is a prospective multicentric cohort study that mixes qualitative and quantitative approaches. The first aim of the quantitative approach is to explore factors related to patients and their caregivers at 6 months that predict participation restriction at 12 months post-stroke. The first aim of the qualitative study is to explore the experience of stroke in minor stroke patients and their proxys."

Clinical cases with frank symptoms caused by CMBs are uncommon, Because CMBs are manifestations of focal extravascular leakage of blood components, however, investigators have suggested that accumulation of CMBs reflects a bleeding-prone status in individuals with an elevated risk of cerebral hemorrhage. Clinical studies have found strong associations between CMBs and chronic hypertension and low cholesterol levels and between the proximity and volume of CMBs and those of subsequent intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) . studies have found that CMBs are linked to subsequent hemorrhagic stroke in stroke survivors,and suggested that CMBs are related to antithrombotic-related hemorrhage."

NCT01796015,"Intracranial hypertension (ICH) is a mortality risk factor in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), in purulent meningitis, in hepatic encephalopathy and in Reye's syndrome. It is also a risk factor for severe neurologic sequelae in survivors. Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is likely to guide therapeutics, and certain research on adults or on children, suggest that IH therapeutic approach, for instance for bacterial meningitis, would improve the prognosis. Two monitoring techniques are currently recommended. They are reference methods for ICP measure :

monitoring with intraventricular catheter,
intra-parenchymal monitoring using optical fiber catheter. Non invasive methods have been suggested, including ultrasound measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) which is the most interesting one. The ONSD measured ultrasonically is correlated with ICP level in adults with severe TBI. A diameter over 5,9 mm predicts ICH within the first 24 hours. In children, ONSD average values have been worked out, and an ONSD increase is found in children suffering from hydrocephalus with IH and in children with TBI. ICH precocious detection is fundamental in children sensitive to ICH because their cerebral development is not finished yet. Difficulties met for ICP monitoring implementation in infants and its invasive nature are often disliked by clinicians. A non-invasive exam is then essential to allow a better care of children with ICH in intensive care unit."

NCT03700879,"Stroke is a devastating disease that affects 15 million patients worldwide each year, resulting in death in about one-third of patients and severe disability in two-thirds of the survivors.

Ischemic stroke in young adults is often thought to be related to rare risk factors and etiological features that are very different from the 'traditional' vascular risk factors and etiology seen in older stroke patients. However, the increase in stroke incidence in young adults has been found to be associated with a rising prevalence of some important traditional vascular risk factors, including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and obesity, in this age group.

Risk factors Modifiable risk factors are the same for both younger and older age groups. However, the prevalence of these risk factors is not the same in these two age groups. Hypertension, heart disease (including atrial fibrillation), and diabetes mellitus are the most common risk factors among the elderly A considerable minority of ischemic stroke cases remains etiologic-ally undefined However, there is still scant information on the role of risk factors and the clinical course in etiologic stroke sub-types.

Although the risk factors of ischemic strokes are well defined, there is slight information about their relations with the etiologies of ischemic strokes. This study will investigate the distribution of ischemic stroke risk factors and their connections to diverse etiologies of cerebrovascular attack (CVA) and specific ischemic regions of brain.

Considering that the prevalence of stroke risk factors rises with aging, the incidence of stroke will increase in further decades as the populations get older. The mortality and morbidity of each stroke pattern is different. So realizing the relation between stroke risk factors and its patterns can show the burden of preventing and treating every risk factor on the outcome of stroke."

With morbidity spanning diverse aspects of a child's life and lasting for decades, global impact is large, including 10000 Canadian children. With pathophysiology poorly understood and prevention strategies non-existent, the burden of hemiparetic CP will persist. Limited treatments lead to loss of hope for children and families, necessitating exploration of new therapies. The investigators have evidence that the investigators have a durable new treatment for perinatal stroke, combining non-invasive neurostimulation and child-centred intensive rehabilitation. Via the CHILD-BRIGHT SPOR national network, the investigators will execute a multicentre trial to prove this treatment can improve function in children with perinatal stroke and hemiparetic CP. Using novel advanced technologies not available elsewhere in the world, the investigators will explore how developmental plasticity determines function and response to neuromodulation therapy. This patient oriented effort will advance personalized, precision medicine in pediatric neurorehabilitation to improve outcomes for disabled children and their families."
NCT03689387,"Physical activity is defined by any movement produced by the skeletal muscles responsible for an increase in energy expenditure.

The Stroke Council of the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends, in prevention after the occurrence of a first stroke, the practice of moderate to intense physical activity for 40 minutes a day, three to four times a week (Lackland et al., 2014). The World Health Organization (WHO) also recommends the practice of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity endurance activity or at least 75 minutes of endurance activity of sustained intensity per week, adapted to the possibilities of the patient (World Health Organization 2010). Unfortunately, the majority of stroke patients have activity below recommendation (Rand et al., 2009).

The main hypothesis of this work is that the amount of AP, measured by self-questionnaire, is insufficient, and below current recommendations in patients with stroke, after return home.

Given the multiple physical, psychological, social, and economic benefits of PA practice, it is also important to identify the habits and challenges that patients experience with PA, so that they can be better informed. advise and guide them to reach AP stroke recommendations."

NCT03682666,"In stroke patients, the most common neurological deficits were motor impairment, loss of somatosensation, abnormal muscle tone, and impaired fractionated movement at affected limbs. Therefore, the investigators try to facilitate upper extremity function and normalize the muscle tone to enlarge their capacity to perform daily activities and to improve life quality by modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) and Kinesiotaping (KT).

The investigators will collect 90 subacute stroke patients with hemiplegia in this study. These 90 patients will be randomly divided into 3 groups. In KT group (n=30), the patients will perform Kinesiology taping for 5 days per week for 3 weeks.

To explore the role of sonoelastography and shear wave velocity in poststroke spasticity assessment."
NCT03686163,"Stroke remains one of the leading causes of death and adult disability worldwide. Yet, currently, the only accepted treatment for acute ischemic stroke(AIS) is recanalization of occluded arteries. Thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator, limited by its narrow therapeutic time window and the concern of hemorrhagic complication, is still uncommon in use. The other approach is to try to impede the ischemic cascade by targeting various components of the cascade that are deemed to be of importance, namely, a neuroprotection strategy.

Nerve growth factor (NGF) plays extensive roles in preventing ischemic injury. Besides that, it is also involved in neurogenesis of the central nervous system (CNS). In addition, the levels of NGF protein and messenger RNA significantly decreased in the CNS at the first few hours and returned to normal levels several days later after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in animal models. These observed results suggested that NGF was demanded in ischemic brain injury, but endogenous NGF is insufficient for the requirement and delivering exogenous ones will be blocked in entering into the CNS by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Intracerebroventricular or intracerebral injection of NGF or grafting of NGF-producing cells may be less practicable due to invasiveness and safety concerns.

Intranasal (IN) administration is a noninvasive and acceptable delivery strategy for drugs bypassing BBB and can deliver NGF to the CNS, which has been proved to show neuroprotective effects on brain injury.

NCT03666702,"Weakness in the arm is common after stroke and can affect stroke survivors' ability to perform some tasks. Studies show that extra sessions of arm exercise can help them to improve their arm function and that the first 3 months is the best time to gain these benefits. A website (www.webbasedphysio.com) has been developed and evaluated for delivering and monitoring physiotherapy exercise programmes. This website has been modified for people after stroke.

The purpose of this study is to assess if doing extra physiotherapy for the arm through our web-based physio website gives any extra benefits to the usual physiotherapy received on the ward. A total of 30 stroke survivors will be recruited from the acute stroke unit of Hairmyres Hospital, NHS Lanarkshire, and will be randomised into two groups: intervention (15) and control (15). The control group will receive usual care and the intervention group will receive usual care plus an augmented and individualised 4 weeks upper limb exercise programme delivered by the web-based physio.

The augmented programme will comprise upper limb and trunk exercises. The duration and intensity of the programme will be based on participants' level of functional ability. For participants with low exercise capacity, the overall time of the exercise will be less to begin with and will build up over time to 30 minutes, five sessions per week (including weekends), in addition to their usual physiotherapy care.

Study assessments will be at baseline, and four weeks post-intervention or just before stroke survivors are discharged, if earlier.

At the end of the study, the feedback from physiotherapy staff, stroke survivors in the intervention group and their carer on the augmented web-based physiotherapy will be evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively by three questionnaires."
NCT03215329,"During general anaesthesia, pulmonary atelectasis has been shown to occur in 85 to 90% of patient. Pulmonary atelectasis increases occurrence of postoperative pulmonary complication including pneumoniae. Pulmonary atelectasis can be prevented or reversed by alveolar recruitment manoeuvres (ARM). Two methods for ARMs have been described. A sustained continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or a stepwise increase in PEEP.The transient increase in intrathoracic pressure during ARMs decreases venous return and increases pulmonary vascular resistance. This result in a decrease in right and left ventricular stroke volume (SV). Finally, the deleterious hemodynamic effects of ARMs may be exacerbated by hypovolemia, heart failure, and in patients with chronic treatment wich impedes cardiovascular responses to hypovolemia. At our best knowledge, there is no study which compared the hemodynamic effects of ARM using sustained CPAP or stepwise increase in PEEP. Consequently, the present study was designed to examine the hemodynamic effects of 2 ARM methods in anesthetized patients."

Generally, PSA is commonly seen in cortical damage, but in recent years it has been found that subcortical injury is also an important cause of PSA, which is called subcortical aphasia. Using fMRI technology, the investigators aim to investigate the language function of patients with subcortical cerebral infarction at different stages of recovery , and explored the mechanism of post-injury language reorganization in the brain.

The investigators recruited 60 first-episode acute cerebral infarction patients with one-side lesion in subcortical white matter (40 with left injury and 20with right injury) and 20 health volunteers. All participants are right-handed, and screened with MMSE, HAMD and HAMA to exclude cases of psychosis, post-stroke dementia and depression. Each participant was arranged to have three test sessions at different stages after the infarction (T1:within 3 days after onset of the stroke ; T2:28 ±3days after onset; T3: 90±3days after onset), with fMRI and Western aphasia battery (WAB) in each session.

The purpose of this study is to explore the pathogenesis of subcortical aphasia, and to understand the dynamic reorganization of language network during the recovery of language function."

NCT03639259,"Fatigue is a prevalent, prolonged and partly disabling symptom following cerebral stroke. The health services has little knowledge of fatigue, both in terms of what characterizes those affected, and with regard to how fatigue can be treated. Persons going through a stroke may experience impairments in cognitive functions such as attention and memory. This will often cause previously effortless activities of daily living to become strenuous and exhausting. Experiencing a stroke will also in many cases lead to a major change in life due to other related loss of function, grief and health-related concerns. Emotional reactions like depression and anxiety are widespread.

Specific knowledge of how cognitive impairment, emotional reactions and coping strategies contribute to development and maintenance of fatigue is lacking. The present research project will contribute with new and important knowledge in this area.

A total of 250 adults have been followed up after stroke with multiple examinations. Average age at the time of stroke was 70 years. The investigators now plan to follow them up three to four years after stroke. This provides a unique opportunity to investigate how depression and anxiety, over time, may be related to the experience of fatigue, cognitive impairment and negative coping strategies such as worrying and rumination. The investigators will use questionnaires and cognitive tests when examining these associations. Such new knowledge about cognitive and emotional factors related to the development of fatigue long-term after stroke may help determine who is at risk of developing symptoms of fatigue. Furthermore, it can shed light on possible preventional measures, and provide better suited advice to those affected by fatigue. This knowledge can also pave the way for new, research-based treatment methods."

NCT03659266,"75% patients in the chronic phase of a stroke keep walking disabilities. Focal spasticity in the paretic lower limb frequently causes these walking disabilities, and the gold standard treatment is intramuscular injection of Botulinum toxin A in the spastic muscles.

To potentiate the effects of toxin, walking rehabilitation is usually prescribed in the weeks following injection, but the protocols vary and few have been evaluated in the medical literature.

In particular, the effect on walking ability of combined treatment by botulinum toxin A and robot-assisted gait training has never been evaluated.

Tested hypothesis: Robot-assisted gait training by Lokomat® motorized exoskeleton potentiates botulinum toxin's effects better than conventional walking therapy.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects on walking ability of the association of focal spasticity treatment by Botulinum toxin and Lokomat-assisted walking rehabilitation in patients suffering from spastic hemiparesia after stroke in the chronic phase.

Outcome:

-Primary: distance walked (meters) in the six-minute walk test (SMWT)

Prospective, randomized, controlled, opened, monocentric study with a crossover design.

Recruitment of patients over 18 years of age, in the chronic phase of stroke, who have already been treated by Botulinum toxin injection for focal spasticity in our PMR ward.

NCT03635008,"Upper limb recovery is not predicted by the initial severity of paralysis and the parameters reflecting the integrity of the corticospinal tract (e.g. motor evoked potential, fractional anisotropy in diffusion tensor imaging). Although the inhibition of the contralesional hemisphere is known to be beneficial for the upper limb recovery after stroke in previous studies, this is not proven in the severely paralyzed upper limb. And the studies using the noninvasive stimulation in subacute stroke is lack. In addition, the role of contralesional (unaffected) hemisphere is known to be playing the important role in severe stroke.

In this randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled studies, the patients with subacute stroke (<3 months after stroke onset), severe paralysis of the upper limb with poor prognosis (poor motor score and no response of motor evoked potential recorded in the extensor carpi radialis muscle) will be recruited.

NCT03633422,"Background and Rationale:

Traditionally, stroke rehabilitation studies have been performed in stroke patients beyond the first one to three months poststroke [Stinear et al. 2013; Veerbeek et al. 2014]. Acknowledging that early stroke rehabilitation should be initiated soon after stroke onset to optimize stroke outcomes, it is has been stressed that stroke rehabilitation trials should be initiated within the first month [Stinear 2013].

Early stroke rehabilitation trials face difficulties regarding patient recruitment with corresponding low enrollment rates [AVERT 2015; Winters 2015]. Explanations are for example priority given to (sub)acute medical interventions, highly dynamic situation at a stroke unit, and a more rapid change in patients' abilities when compared to patients in later stages poststroke. With the low enrollment rates (~7%), the generalizability of study results is questionable.

Participant screening methods and procedures for research eligibility are part of the patient selection and recruitment process in clinical trials. However, no information is available regarding screening procedures and methods for these early initiated stroke rehabilitation trials, including reasons for not enrolling patients. This knowledge is essential to improve screening procedures and methods, in order to optimize patient enrollment and with that, increase the generalizability of study results.

Objective:

The objective of this project is to evaluate screening methods and procedures for stroke rehabilitation research.

NCT01758952,"Stroke is an important cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients > 60 years. In cardiac, neurological and carotid surgery the incidence is known to be high (2.2-5.2%). However, little is known regarding perioperative stroke following other types of surgery including general, urological, orthopedic, thoracic and gynecological procedures.

NCT01769703,"Objective: Demonstrate the safety of early use of dabigatran following TIA/minor stroke.

Background: Although aggressive antithrombotic therapy has been shown to reduce the number of new ischemic events following stroke/TIA, this has always been offset by an increase in the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Dabigatran is much safer than previously tested antithrombotic agents, with respect to intracranial bleeding and therefore offers a unique treatment opportunity in these high-risk patients. TIA/minor stroke represent the largest group of cerebrovascular disease patients. A short-term intervention such as 30 days of dabigatran treatment has the potential for a very large impact from the population health perspective, given the number of patients who may be treated if a benefit can be demonstrated.

Study design:

This is an open label, single arm study. Patients with TIA/minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score </=3) who can be treated within 24 hours of symptom onset will be eligible. All patients will be treated with dabigatran for 30 days. The dose of dabigatran will be determined by age and renal function (patients >80 years old and/or with GFR 30-50 ml/min will received 110 mg bid, and all other patients will receive 150 mg BID).The primary endpoint is symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. Patients (n=50) with TIA/minor stroke, defined as having a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Score of </=3, will undergo an MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), as well as gradient recall echo (GRE) sequences, which will be used to assess for hemorrhagic transformation. Patients will have a repeat MRI examination at 7 and 30 days to assess for hemorrhagic transformation and new lesion development. The primary endpoint of of phase I is symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation, defined as a parenchymal hematoma on the day 7 MRI scan (GRE sequence), associated with clinical worsening (>/=4 point increase in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score).

If dabigatran can be used safely in this population, a second phase aimed at demonstrating the rate of new ischemic lesion development following TIA can be reduced with aggressive antithrombotic therapy. A randomized open-label, blinded endpoint evaluation design will be employed. The investigators hypothesize that dabigatran therapy administered within 24 hours of symptom onset will reduce the rate of new ischemic lesions, relative to standard care, one week and 30 days after onset."
NCT01986023,"The impact of medications used for secondary stroke prevention relies heavily upon patient adherence.

NCT02259062,"Stroke is the biggest cause of disability in older adults. Early poststroke rehabilitation focuses primarily on physical disability and activities of daily living. By contrast, relatively little research attention has been paid to the potential for cognitive rehabilitation and mood enhancing interventions in the early stages after stroke. Low mood and cognitive difficulties with attention and memory are common post stroke leading to poorer recovery, emotional wellbeing and quality of life yet accessible and effective therapies are lacking.

Engagement in leisure activities may enhance recovery after stroke but participation in leisure activities is reduced following stroke. Music listening is a low cost and accessible leisure activity that has been suggested to improve mood and cognition poststroke. The investigators speculate that music listening may enhance control of attention in a similar way to mindfulness interventions, that have been demonstrated to be beneficial in the treatment of mood disorders. The investigators propose that adding a brief mindfulness intervention to music listening might enhance the effect on control of attention, with positive effects on cognition and mood poststroke but the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention needs to be evaluated before attempting a further trial assessing the effectiveness of this intervention. The investigators aim to recruit 100 patients within two weeks poststroke.

Participants will be randomly assigned to receive an 8 week music listening alone, music listening with brief mindfulness or audiobook listening intervention alongside treatment as usual. Neuropsychological assessment of cognition and mood will be performed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months poststroke In addition, participants will be interviewed about their experience of engaging in the interventions."
NCT01855035,The purpose of this study is to assess whether repeated enhanced and prolonged ECG monitoring after ischemic stroke results in a higher detection of atrial fibrillation (/flutter) compared to usual care (at least 24 hour of cardiac monitoring).
NCT05378035,"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have emerged as safe and efficacious ischemic stroke prophylaxis for non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). All four DOACs - apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban - were shown to reduce the risk of major bleeding compared to warfarin. The predictable pharmacokinetic profiles of DOACs also favour their use over warfarin. Together with increasing AF incidence due to population ageing, increased AF detection, and territory-wide reimbursement schemes, DOAC prescriptions have been surging worldwide. In Hong Kong, more than 78,354 patients received DOAC from January 2009 through April 2021 according to the Hospital Authority registry.

The more liberal use of DOACs has led to new issues that require a thorough understanding of ethnic-specific DOAC pharmacokinetic profiles. For instance, 12- 15% of anticoagulated patients annually required interventional procedures that involve temporary discontinuation of DOAC for 48 hours or more. Although guideline-based periprocedural DOAC interruption resulted in a low 30-day thromboembolism rate of 0.16% - 0.6% in a Caucasian cohort, same measures for elective colonoscopies in a local population-based study resulted in a 30-day periprocedural thromboembolism rate of up to 2.2%. Although these studies cannot be compared directly, the remarkable interethnic discrepancy between the two cohorts warrants further pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic studies. More importantly, quantifying residual DOAC levels during the interruption periods may imply on duration of periprocedural DOAC interruption, length of hospital-stay, and the risk of thromboembolic and bleeding complications.

Mapping inter- and intra-individual variations in DOAC levels may also impact on the management of ischemic stroke among DOAC recipients. Epidemiological studies have shown alarmingly up to 13% of acute ischemic stroke patients were on anticoagulation prior to stroke onset with increasing number of DOAC. These patients received low rates of recanalization therapy due to apprehension of bleeding complications, thus compromised survival and neurological recovery. A prospective study that reveals Asian-specific DOAC pharmacokinetic profiles may inform cross-disciplinary, territory-wide periprocedural care and acute stroke intervention strategy for the rapidly expanding DOAC population."

NCT03469778,"The objectives of this phase II clinical study are: evaluate the efficacy, safety, patient adeherence and clinical applicability of a new robotic device for patients with stroke at a physical rehabilitation institution (Instituto de Medicina Física e Reabilitação do Hospital das Clínicas da Universidade de São Paulo - IMREA HCFMUSP - Rede de Reabilitação Lucy Montoro, unidade Vila Mariana). Methods: 10 patients with stroke diagnosis and Fugl-Meyer score ranging from 34 to 55 will be selected to be included in the study. After signing the informed consent form and being assessed by the baseline evaluations, they will undertake 18 sessions of robotic therapy, which in its turn will be prescribed three times a week. After this period, the patients will be evaluated for future comparison of both the pre-treatment and final assessments."
NCT02272426,"It is estimated that 2 out of 3 patients with a stroke have some problems with their memory, difficulties performing certain tasks, making decisions and learning new things. In addition, many stroke patients do not get regular exercise and are often sedentary. Both physical and cognitive exercise have the potential to improve quality of life, cognition, and overall health, but the safety and tolerability of such interventions is not clear in stroke patients. The investigators will examine these outcomes by allocating stroke survivor participants to one of two groups: a combined exercise and cognitive training program and a sham control group."
NCT02188420,"After a stroke, there is an exaggerated inhibitory influence from the non-stroke hemisphere to the stroke hemisphere. Brain stimulation using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the non-stroke hemisphere can decrease this inhibition. Paired Associative Stimulation (PAS) may be a more effective way to produce this same inhibition, as shown in healthy subjects. However, it is not known whether this will translate to people with stroke. PAS consists of a peripheral nerve stimulus paired a short time later with a cortical stimulus to change the excitability within the brain. Thus the investigators will apply PAS to people with stroke, but the investigators need to first determine the most effective interpulse interval (IPI) between the peripheral and cortical stimuli. Our research question is which of three different IPIs is most effective in changing the excitability of the brain.

The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal IPI between a peripheral nerve pulse and a cortical stimulus that will be most effective in changing excitability of the brain in people with chronic stroke. The investigators hypothesize that the cortical excitability of the nonstroke hemisphere will be most inhibited with the latency-5ms condition."
NCT03210051,"Currently, early reperfusion is considered as the most effective therapy for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Over the past 20 years, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) has been demonstrated to be the only effective therapy for AIS. More recently, several large randomized clinical trials have concluded the superiority of endovascular mechanical thrombectomy for AIS. Furthermore, with the development of materials and techniques, the occluded artery can be recanalized with high percentage (60%-90%), and the rate of recanalization is still being improved. A great number of AIS patients are now eligible for revascularization therapy and there should be a good prognosis of AIS after recanalizing the occluded artery using mechanical thrombectomy. However, things are never as simple as wished to be. The rate of patients with functional independence is less than 50% and over 15% patients died at 3 months post thrombectomy. The discrepancy between the functional outcome and recanalization rates encourage researchers to explore strategies that further improving the functional outcome of AIS patients.

Remote ischemic conditioning has been demonstrated to reduce cerebral infarct size in mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia. And clinical researches demonstrated the protective effects of remote ischemic conditioning in AIS patient treated with IV tPA,. However, whether remote ischemic conditioning is safe and effective in protecting patients with large-vessel ischemic stroke and undergoing endovascular treatment is still unknown."

NCT03432871,"Mitochondria are important parts of the cell that are responsible for producing energy. The amount of energy they produce depends on how much energy the body needs to function and this energy production can be severely impaired in people with mitochondrial disease. Symptoms of mitochondrial disease vary widely but usually involve the brain, nerves and muscles, as these are tissues that need a lot of energy. Mitochondrial disorders affect 1 in 5000 of the UK population and there is currently no cure.

Some scientists think that increasing the number of mitochondria in the body (mitochondrial biogenesis) might be an effective treatment for the symptoms of mitochondrial disease. Studies carried out in mice have shown that a type of B-vitamin called Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) is able to increase the number of mitochondria, leading to increased energy and a reduction in the symptoms of mitochondrial disease.

The aim of this study is to investigate if the same B vitamin, Nicotinamide Riboside, can increase energy production and reduce symptoms in humans with mitochondrial disease.

The study will consist of two parts:

Part 1: Participants will be given a single oral dose of Nicotinamide Riboside and the levels of NR in their bloodstream will be measured at regular intervals. This will involve a single overnight stay and simple blood tests.

Part 2: This requires 6 separate visits from each participant. Each participant will undergo a series of standard tests including a muscle biopsy and an MRI scan, then they will take a course of Nicotinamide Riboside (twice daily for 4 weeks). After 4 weeks of treatment, the participants will undergo the same tests again to see if there have been any changes in response to the treatment."

NCT03434938,"Background: Rehabilitation pathways are crucial to reduce stroke-related disability. Motivational Interviewing (MI), a centred-person intervention aimed to empower and motivate the patient, could be a resource to improve rehabilitation and its outcomes for older stroke survivors.

Objective: The IMAGINE project aims to assess the impact of MI associated to standard geriatric rehabilitation, on 30 days functional improvement measured by the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), compared to standard geriatric rehabilitation alone, in patients admitted to geriatric rehabilitation after a stroke. Secondary objectives will be to assess the impact on physical activity and performance, self-efficacy, sense of coherence, safety, cost-utility and participants' experience, plus functional status at 3 months.

Methods: Multicenter randomized clinical trial in three geriatric rehabilitation departments. Older adults after mild-moderate stroke without previous dementia, post-stroke severe cognitive impairment or delirium at admission, severe previous disability, aphasia or terminal conditions will be randomized into the control or the intervention group (136 per group, total N = 272). The control group will receive written information about the benefits of exercising, besides standard rehabilitation. The intervention group, in addition, will receive 4 sessions of MI by trained nurses. A shared tailored plan based on patients' goals, needs, preferences and capabilities will be agreed. Besides the FIM, in-hospital physical activity will be measured through accelerometers (activPAL) and secondary outcomes using internationally validated scales. As a complex intervention, a process evaluation and cost-utility assessments will be performed too.

Results: Final results are expected by end of 2020. Implications: This project aims to achieve impacts on functional status, disability and physical performance and behavioral (increasing physical activity) and psychological implications (on general self-efficacy and sense of coherence) through a non-pharmacological and likely accessible, acceptable and scalable intervention. Efficiency and value, based on costs/quality adjusted life years, will be assessed. Moreover, a reduction in post-stroke disability would have social benefits also for families and would reduce health and social care costs. In brief, advances will be in terms of a better rehabilitation process."
NCT03463746,"Background and Rationale:

Every year, more than a 15 million people worldwide suffer a stroke1. Despite laborious rehabilitation programs 70% of those stroke patients still show limited gait ability after three months.

Numerous RCTs have shown the superiority of over ground gait training and electromechanical-assisted gait devices in comparison with conventional over ground gait training alone. (Jan Mehrholz, Elsner, Werner, Kugler, & Pohl, 2013) However, most of these trials used the electromechanical-assisted gait devices in a very high frequency which is almost impossible to achieve in daily clinical routine. Therefore, the effect of a practice-oriented physical therapy protocol including electromechanical-assisted gait training remains unclear.

Objective(s):

The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the effects of an integrated, practice-orientated individual physical therapy protocol with or without electromechanical-assisted gait training in subacute stroke patients, respectively.

The effects of both physical therapy protocols will be compared with validated assessments covering the different components of the ICF framework: function, activity and participation.

Primary objectives: Effects on gait ability and on basic activities of daily living (ADL).

Secondary objectives: Effects on walking speed, walking capacity, functional mobility, muscle force, spasticity and reintegration to normal living (RNLI).

Furthermore, different training-related data are recorded to capture the efficiency (intensity and hassle) of both physical therapy protocols."

NCT03423433,"Physical inactivity and increased sedentary time are linked to increased blood pressure and may cause decreases in peripheral and cerebral oxygen perfusion in stroke survivors. Nonetheless, stroke survivors are significantly less active than their healthy counterparts due to physical incapability or a lack of confidence in physical capability. This study will determine whether a simple and non-demanding movement such as repeated heel raises are able to cause acute and chronic decreases in peripheral and central blood pressure and increases in oxygen perfusion and cognitive performance.

Thirty participants will be recruited to this study. All will take part in four sessions. One familiarisation session will acclimatise participants to the equipment used involving central and peripheral blood pressures, pulse wave velocity, arterial stiffness, maximal voluntary contractions of the medial gastrocnemius and Stroop tasks.. Two experimental sessions will take place involving extended sedentary time (one involving uninterrupted sedentary time and one including ten heel raises every ten minutes). A control condition of 15 participants will then be tested ten weeks post-.

NCT03424031,"Functional recovery is one of the main issues in the management of stroke and there are various ways in rehabilitation to promote this recovery.

Verticalization is a technique whose benefits have been widely demonstrated, particularly in neurology. Although commonly used in the rehabilitation of stroke, evidence is still lacking as to its impact in this specific care.

Verticalization is underutilized in two situations: in the hyper acute phase as well as in elderly and very deficient patients. It has, however, been shown that the precocity of the treatment allows a better functional recovery. Similarly, the re-education of the elderly is also debated since it has long been mentioned that age was a factor of poor prognosis, the objectives are sometimes underestimated. However, several studies have shown that with the same rehabilitation, elderly patients recover as much as younger patients. The differences found are at least in part due to ""less rehabilitation"" of older stroke patients.

The different existing data lead us to the hypothesis that the verticalization of the elderly hemiplegic patient in acute phase would allow a better functional recovery."

NCT04767334,"Stroke is neurological disease characterized by chronic major disability which will cause permanent changes in individuals life. In Saudi Arabia stroke considered as the main leading of disability and death. It is estimated to be 0.67% in Saudi Arabia compared to 2.5% of the population in the United States (US). Most of individuals have mobility deficit such as walk speed and postural maintenance which lead to increase the risk of fall and decrease activity of daily living (ADL).

Stroke rehabilitation should starts as early as possible to avoid post-stroke complications. Several interventions for stroke rehabilitation to improve mobility deficit and posture control continuously being evaluated. One of the ways of stroke rehabilitation is a using of body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT). It is a useful tool to facilitate gait training and recovery after neurological injures.

The lower body positive pressure (LBPP) is a treadmill that is enclosed in inflated bag. There is a chamber inside the treadmill that is produce air pressure which is aid in eliminate the uncomfortableness feeling produce by weight bearing during gait. The chamber is supplied with a system provide LBPP aiding in decrease patient weight while walking by giving the patient lifting force from below using air pressure. This helps the patient to walk affectively with minimum weight bearing on the lower extremity.

NCT03394950,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the most common type of stroke, which has high rate of morbidity, mortality and disability. A large number of studies have confirmed that the thrombolytic therapy can effectively open blood vessels and improve the functional prognosis of acute ischemic stroke. Therefore, all guidelines recommend giving thrombolysis treatment to acute ischemic stroke patients within 4.5 hours of onset. However, about 1/3 patients receiving thrombolysis will have good prognosis, while a large number of patients will still be disabled and even dead. How to improve the neurofunctional prognosis of thrombolytic patients has been a hot topic in the world.

Butyl phthalide is type I chemical drugs. Some multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials have showed that acute ischemic stroke patients taking butyl phthalide has better lateral branch circulation and living ability score than patients taking placebo. Besides, butyl phthalide treatment is safe. The animal experiment indicated that buphthalein could significantly improve secondary side branch circulation, recover the microarterial diameter of the soft meninges in the ischemic region and increase the blood flow rate.

Based on the discussion, we assume that: giving butyl phthalide to patients with acute ischemic stroke in advance, might promote and improve the formation of collateral circulation to freeze ischemia penumbra. Based on this hypothesis, we would like to explore the efficacy and safety of butyl phthalide combined with rtPA thrombolysis in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke."

NCT03545477,"The recovery of walking ability is crucial to promote independence in daily living and is one of the major goal of neuromotor rehabilitation.

Currently, standard rehabilitative programs are usually based on straight-walking training (SWT) and the assessment of their effects is performed through functional scales based on straight-walking trajectories, e.g. Timed Up and Go (TUG), 10 meters walking test (10mWT).

Curved-walking training (CWT) may be interesting to provide an ecological and challenging context during rehabilitation. Indeed, CWT is based on demanding neural processes that drive an asymmetrical contribution at lower limb level, challenging balance ability and complex adaptation such as body weight shifting in response to centrifugal force and production of different step lengths.

Up to now, literature has investigated CWT in healthy adults in terms of muscular activation, kinematics and kinetics of the movement. Results showed that CWT needs a different biomechanical strategy with respect to SWT. Nevertheless CWT has not been investigated in pathological adults.

The present study aims at assessing the effectiveness of a rehabilitative physical therapy based on CWT with respect to traditional SWT for the recovery of locomotor abilities in neurological and orthopaedic patients.

The hypothesis is that a training based on curved-walking is ecologically meaningful and may be superior with respect to standard training in improving balance, walking abilities, and independence in activity of daily live of patients.

A secondary aim of the project is to propose an innovative functional scale based on the timed up and go on curved trajectory (CTUG), and to determine its reliability and responsiveness, establishing the minimum Detectable Change (MDC) and the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID).

A single-blind randomized controlled study is being carried out on three different populations:

Post-acute stroke patients
Idiopathic Parkinson Disease
Femoral fracture

The experimental one performs a novel rehabilitative program composed by a 30-minute training on curved trajectory (""S"" trajectory composed by two semicircle with a radius of 1.2 m) in addition to usual care. The control group performs an equal dose of traditional treatment on straight trajectories.

Both groups undergo 20 90-minutes sessions of training (three times a week for seven weeks).

Participants are evaluated at baseline (T0), after training (T1), and at a three-months follow-up visit (T2).

NCT03260686,"People who have had a stroke benefit from opportunities to practice the activities they need to re-learn. It is common practice to give patients written exercises to guide their practice out of therapy session. Whilst more practice is better, it is important that the activities are practiced accurately, to ensure that the right movement patterns are re-learned.

The aim of this study, is to evaluate whether an intervention providing in-patients who have had a stroke an opportunity to use a simple video guide to help them perform their exercises accurately would improve clinical outcomes. Watching an activity being performed helps you to learn the activity more effectively. The focus of this study is arm rehabilitation.

The participants will be adult in-patients in Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust, and will have had a first time stroke that has left them with some arm weakness.

The participants will be matched according to the severity of their weakness, then randomly allocated to either a treatment as usual group, or an intervention group. Those in the intervention group will have their exercises for their arm and hand recorded onto a tablet during their normal therapy session. They will then be lent the tablet for the duration of the trial, so they can have a visual guide to help them throughout the trial period. Ward staff will be shown how to use the tablet to help any participants who struggle with the technology.

Measurements will be made before and after the trial period to look at ability to move the arm and hand, quality of movement, self-efficacy and time spent exercising. Participants and staff will be asked for their experiences of the intervention or normal practice.

This is a feasibility study with an embedded process evaluation."

NCT03333330,"Background-White matter hyperintensities (WMH), patchy areas of hyperintense signal on T2-weighted or Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery sequences on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are believed to reflect cerebral burden of ischemic damage and are associated to incident stroke, dementia and eventually mortality in otherwise healthy subjects. Also brain atrophy has been related with presence of carotid atherosclerosis and vascular cognitive impairment. Carotid atherosclerosis may contribute to the genesis of WMH. A recent meta-analysis by our group comprising 5306 subjects was able to demonstrate an association between the presence of carotid atherosclerosis and WMH (odds ratio, OR, 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-1.66).

Objective-To evaluate the relation between carotid artery plaque characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors and brain atrophy/WMH burden analyzed quantitatively as number and volume of lesions and as brain volumes, and progression over 18 months of follow up in subjects asymptomatic for cerebrovascular disease with a carotid artery stenosis <70%."
NCT02101606,"Rationale The only proven therapy for acute stroke is tPA within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. This is the standard of care for patients presenting to our hospital within that time frame. Thrombolysis outside the 4.5 hour window is considered only on experimental or compassionate grounds. Tenecteplase (TNK) is a genetically modified variant of tPA that has many theoretical advantages in acute stroke. Studies show that systemic plasminogen activation is higher after tPA administration, relative to TNK and this is associated with an increased risk of bleeding events. Imaging cerebral blood flow (CBF) with MRI (perfusion weighted imaging-PWI) and CT perfusion (CTP) can be performed routinely with standard clinical scanners. Patients with evidence of large volumes of tissue with low CBF, that is also structurally intact, as demonstrated by either normal signal on Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) or normal cerebral blood volume (CBV) are considered to have penumbral patterns. Patients with penumbral patterns appear to be the ideal candidates for thrombolytic therapy, regardless of time from onset.

Study Hypotheses

The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of TNK based thrombolysis in ischemic stroke patients presenting 4.5-24 hours after symptom onset.
It is hypothesized that treatment with TNK in patients with penumbral patterns will be associated with reperfusion, early neurological improvement and penumbral tissue salvage.

Study Design The study is planned as an open label feasibility and safety study of acute treatment with TNK in ischemic stroke patients with penumbral patterns evident on advanced MRI or CT perfusion sequences.

Study Outcomes The primary outcome of this study is a safety endpoint, specifically the frequency of symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation evident on MRI or CT images on 24 h or day 5 scans. The ECASS II system for rating hemorrhagic transformation will be applied to all GRE/SWI images

Significance Current treatment paradigms have not permitted success of tPA to be extended beyond narrow and limiting therapeutic window of 4.5 hours. Clearly, more effective patient selection criteria are required. Penumbral imaging is biologically plausible, practical and has been shown to be predictive of outcome. Application of these imaging techniques to the acute stroke population is the most promising strategy for extending the therapeutic window and for introducing superior thrombolytic agents."
NCT04441515,"Music that is familiar and preferred by patients has been shown to heighten neuroplasticity and can mitigate these disabilities. Therefore, this study seeks to explore the effect of providing patient preferred music to patients in the very early post stroke period (within 24 hours of a left cerebral artery stroke [LMCA]event) as a complementary modality to usual stroke care."
NCT03318744,"Silent brain infarction (SBI) or incidental infarct is common. Recent studies revealed individuals with SBI have an increased risk of future stroke. Even though the 2014 AHA/ASA recommendation for ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack considered SBI as an entry point for secondary prevention, convincing evidence with regard to the preventive efficacy of antiplatelet therapy against incident stroke in SBI is scant. Investigators examine if antiplatelet therapy can effectively decrease the incidence of future stroke in SBI individuals."

NCT03318679,"Hyperglycemia is present in 50 percent of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Patients with hyperglycemia have higher in hospital, 30 and 90 day mortality and morbidity. Sixty percent of these patients have some form of diabetic syndrome, known or unknown. Remaining 40% of patients are not diabetic. Contrary to logic patients with non diabetic hyperglycemia (NDH) have statistically higher morbidity and mortality compared to the diabetic hyperglycemia (DH) cohort. So far multiple treatment trials (THIS, GRASP, GIST-UK, SHINE ongoing) with differing treatment goals have shown no clear benefit, however no obvious distinction was made along the diabetic and non-diabetic hyperglycemic groups.

If hyperglycemia in the acute phase was the only culprit in worsening the injury, then there should be no difference in the outcomes for DH and NDH. Existing data implies that the two categories are two distinct physiological entities that are thus not amenable to same treatment. Stating it simply NDH is not an insulin deficient state where as DH is.

Alternative possibility is that body and Neurons are accustomed to high sugars in diabetics and thus can tolerate higher sugars better during ischemic stroke compared to non diabetics.

The overarching hypothesis is that reducing blood sugars in NDH increases stroke volume and thus consequently worsens outcome."

NCT03303820,"Many clinical trials show that 30 to 50 % of the hospitalized patients are undernourished in various degrees. This prevalence didn't change since 15-20 years The fact is that the present undernutrition in the admission deteriorates during the hospitalization.

Besides, the cerebral vascular accident (AVC) complicates the first days, in at least 50 % of the cases, the disorders of the gulp, which are a risk factor of acquired undernutrition. The nutrition holds an important place in the therapeutic coverage of the AVC. Nevertheless, the link between the undernutrition the entrance and the evolution of the AVC is at the moment only little known. The purpose is to study the impact of the undernutrition in the entrance to the hospital (undernutrition previous to the AVC), on the gravity and the evolution"

NCT03292211,"This study aims to examine the outcomes of early mobilization and early intervention within 24-72 hours after the onset of hemorrhagic stroke in patients admitted to an intensive care unit within 24 hours after stroke. The patients after hemorrhagic stroke who undergo early intervention only will be compared with those who also receive early mobilization in order to determine if the early mobilization intervention results in earlier or more effective recovery of postural stability, activities of daily living function, or motor capacity.

The participants will be randomly assigned to the following two groups: (1) the early mobilization (+early rehabilitation) group and (2) the early rehabilitation group.The measurement parameters will be collected before the intervention (basic parameters), two weeks after the stroke, four weeks after the stroke and three months after the stroke. SPSS (version 17.0) will be used to carry out repeated measures analysis of variance (repeated ANOVA) to compare the differences between the groups at different time points (including basic values and follow-up values). For statistical significance, Bonferroni correction will be applied for the post-hoc analysis of the groups."
NCT03288090,"Cerebral infarction is a type of stroke that can lead to sometimes disabling sequelae. Among these sequelae, fatigue is frequently reported by patients. It is therefore important for doctors to understand why patients suffer from fatigue after cerebral infarction and to determine whether treatments given for the cerebral infarction may have an impact on this fatigue.

The aim of this research was to study the frequency of fatigue after cerebral infarction, the associated factors, in particular the impact of treatments administered in the acute phase."
NCT05621980,"Human development as a species has been strongly associated with the ability to dexterously manipulate objects and tools. Unfortunately, current therapy efforts typically fail to restore fine manual control after stroke. The goal of this study is to evaluate a new intervention that would combine targeted electrical stimulation of selected nerves with use a soft, pneumatically actuated hand exoskeleton to enhance repetitive practice of independent movements of the fingers and thumb in order to improve rehabilitation of hand function after stroke.

The investigators will recruit stroke survivors in the subacute phase of recovery (2-6 months post-stroke). These participants will be involved in a 6-week intervention involving 18 training sessions. During these sessions, participants will train independent movement of the digits of the paretic hand. Evaluation of motor control of the paretic hand will occur prior to initiation of training, at the midpoint of the training period, after completion of training, and one month later."
NCT03295032,"Stroke is one of the main causes of acquired adult disability in the UK. Many psychological problems can also occur post-stroke; this has a marked impact on health service usage. As such, there is an outstanding need to increase and improve psychological resources within stroke services.

NCT03290833,"The effectiveness of robotic over conventional therapy is arguable and the best therapy strategy is still not clear. Basing on the existing evidence on motor learning and practice-induced neuroplasticity, the investigators plan to use an exoskeleton robotic hand to enhance the rehabilitation volume in the subacute stage of stroke patients. The robotic system allows intensive and customized training of hand and finger movements. The aim of this study is (1) to establish whether robot assisted therapy provides any additional motor recovery for the hand when administered during the subacute stage in a Chinese adult population diagnosed with stroke; (2) to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of robot-assisted hand rehabilitation in improving arm function abilities in subacute hemiplegic patients."
NCT03285919,"A control and a post-stroke subject with right-side chronic hemiparesis were studied. The post-stroke subject underwent 30 sessions of balance-perturbed training while walking on an instrumented treadmill where the Balance Assessment Robot (BAR™) randomly delivered pushes to pelvis in various directions at various speeds and at various perturbation amplitudes.

Reduced speed and asymmetry of stepping is a specific characteristic of hemiplegic gait. Asymmetry of stepping is characterized by shorter step length of the unaffected limb compared to the affected limb. Causes of this phenomenon are difficulty in weight bearing at the affected limb, weak propulsive force of the affected limb, and decreased strength of hip extensors. To correct these factors. we have developed an anteroposterior weight shifting training system with visual feedback and studied its effects."

Recently, more challenging approaches, such as stimulation of two or more sites or use of dual modality have been studied in stroke patients. In this study, simultaneous stimulation using both rTMS and tDCS (dual-mode stimulation) over bilateral primary motor cortices (M1s) was investigated to compare its modulatory effects with single rTMS stimulation in subacute stroke patients."
NCT03147794,"A new technology system called MyndMove has been developed by MyndTec Inc. (Missisauga Canada) to administer FES. The purpose of this technology is to improve voluntary upper limb (hand and arm) function (i.e. reaching and grasping) for patients with hemiparesis as a results of stroke or spinal cord injury (7). It is a non-invasive application that delivers electrical stimulation to the affected limb transcutaneously. MyndMove has been licensed by Health Canada and is indicated as a functional electrical stimulator for improvement of arm and hand function and active range of motion in patients with hemiplegia due to stroke or upper limb paralysis due to C3-C7 spinal cord injury. In a randomized controlled trial looking at adults with acute stroke and limited or complete immobility of the arm, FES and intensive therapy was shown to have significant improvement of hand function compared to the control group that was exposed to intensive therapy only (8). Limited research using MyndMove to administer FES has been conducted for pediatric populations, however there is significant potential for FES and intensive therapy to improve hand function for children with upper extremity hemiparesis using MyndMove technology. Before the efficacy of MyndMove therapy can be evaluated in children age 3 to 6, the tolerability of the system must first be evaluated and proven for this age group."

NCT03259399,"Dry cough is the most common adverse reaction of angiotensin converting enzyme, including enalapril, in Chinese population. Clinical observations suggest that the incidence of ACEI-induced dry cough is different between Chinese and other racial groups, however, there is still lack of research data in Chinese. Stroke is the second leading cause of death in the world and leading cause of death in China. Except the known risk factor such as hypertension, high homocysteine level, folic acid deficiency, the impact of genetics should not be ignored.

In this study, we will investigate whether there are specific genotypes which may predict the incidence of (1)enalapril-induced dry cough in Chinese and (2)first stroke in hypertensive patients taking enalapril or enalapril-folic acid therapy, so as to provide a basis for developing guidelines on precision medication in enalapril therapy apply to Chinese population."

However, the results of previous studies have been inconsistent.

Objectives: To investigate the associations between dietary intake of ALA, adipose tissue content of ALA, and the risk of the major atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases incident myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and subtypes, and peripheral artery disease.

Methods: This project will be based on data from the Danish cohort study Diet, Cancer and Health which consisted of 57,053 men and women at recruitment between 1993 and 1997. Dietary intake of ALA will be assessed using a validated semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire and adipose tissue content will be determined with the use of gas chromatography analyses of adipose tissue biopsies collected at baseline. Also, detailed information on lifestyle factors, medical history and anthropometri was collected at baseline.

Incident cases have been identified through national registries and the diagnoses have previously been validated.

Analyses of dietary intake of ALA will be analysed using a traditional cohort design, whereas analyses on adipose tissue content of ALA will be analysed based on a case-cohort design. Hazard ratioes with 95% confidence intervals will be used to describe the associations between the exposure variables and the outcome variables of interest."

The psychological wellbeing of stroke survivors and family caregivers is thought to be interconnected and can have an important role to play in rehabilitation outcomes. Mindfulness meditation can help improve psychological wellbeing, but it often involves people attending groups by themselves and engagement can be poor. One solution is for stroke survivors and family caregivers to learn mindfulness meditation together online.

NCT03252236,"People with stroke suffer from different impairments, including the ability to dual-tasking, increased arterial stiffness, and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. The decrement in dual-tasking performance has been found among stroke survivors, and the deterioration has been related to increased risk of fall in the population. No coherent result has been concluded from previous studies investigating the effect of different types of exercise training on enhancing dual-tasking performance among healthy older adults and stroke survivors.

Increased arterial stiffness and impaired functioning of the autonomic nervous systems, which have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk and mortality, are common in stroke survivors. Studies have been suggesting the beneficial effects of aerobic exercise on both decreasing arterial stiffness and regulating the autonomic nervous system among healthy older people. However, only a few studies concerning such topic have been conducted among stroke survivors, yet the results were inconsistent.

Tai Chi is a Chinese traditional martial art and has been employed as a rehabilitation exercise in recent decades. Tai Chi practitioners should perform the physical movement and plan the Tai Chi forms simultaneously. The involvement of cognitive functioning gives Tai Chi a dual-tasking character. Prior studies demonstrated the beneficial effect of Tai Chi training on dual-tasking performance in healthy older adults, but would the effect extend to stroke survivors has not yet been studied.

Also, Tai Chi is considered as a mind-body exercise. It is suggested that one should keep a relaxed status of mind and breathe gently and slowly. Moreover, Tai Chi is an exercise with moderate intensity. These features have been found to decrease arterial stiffness and benefit functioning of the autonomic nervous system. Indeed, studies have been showing Tai Chi reduces arterial stiffness and improves regulation of the autonomic nervous system among healthy population. Whether such effect can be observed in stroke survivors is still unknown.

This study aimed at investigating the effects of Tai Chi training on dual-tasking performance, arterial stiffness, and autonomic system functioning among stroke survivors. Given the special features of Tai Chi and its advantageous effects on the mentioned functioning, it is expected that stroke survivors may also benefit from Tai Chi training."

NCT03177161,"A Patient Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) is a questionnaire that asks patients for their views on their own health or the impact of healthcare they have received on their health and quality of life (RCN, 2011). The benefit of PROMS is that they gather information from the patient's perspective, which offers great potential to improve the quality and outcomes of health services (Department of Health 2011).

There is a PROM (the PROMIS-10 Global Health) and a number of extra questions that are recommended for use in people who have had a stroke by the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement, but the best way of delivering these questions for stroke survivors is unknown.

At present, the NHS in England, Scotland and Wales are required to offer every stroke survivors a 6 month post stroke follow-up appointment. Currently, the information collected at the 6 month review is not from the patient's perspective and the best method of collecting this information has not been established. The Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) which is led by the Royal College of Physicians in London promote the 6 month follow-up assessment. SSNAP recognise that currently 4 different methods of 6 month follow-up appointment occur. The current methods in use are face-to-face assessment, telephone interview, online questionnaire or postal questionnaire.

The aim of this research is to understand if there is a difference between these 4 methods of delivering these questions in people who have had a stroke.

NCT03160131,"In Denmark, about 120,000 people suffer from brain damage, of whom approx. 75,000 with brain damage after stroke. Serious and often lasting vision impairments affect 20% to 35% of people after stroke. Vision is the most important sense in humans, and even smaller permanent injuries can drastically reduce quality of life.

Vision impairments after brain damage inhibits rehabilitation and enhances other invalidating effects. Reduced vision results in impaired balance, increased risk of serious falls, increased support needs, reduced quality of life, and impaired ability to perform activities of daily living. Restoration of visual field impairments occur only to a small extent during the first month after brain damage, and therefore the time window for spontaneous improvements is very limited. Hence, brain-impaired persons with visual impairment will most likely experience chronically impaired vision already 4 weeks after brain injury and the need for visual compensatory rehabilitation is substantial.

Neuro Vision Technology (NVT) is an supervised training course where people with visual impairments are trained in compensatory techniques using special equipment. Through the NVT process, the individual's vision problems are carefully investigated and personal data is used to organize individual training sessions that practice the individual in coping with situations that cause problems in everyday life.

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether rehabilitation with NVT can cause significant and lasting improvement in functional capacity in persons with chronic visual impairments after brain injury. Improving eyesight is expected to increase both physical and mental functioning, thus improving the quality of life. Participants included in the project will be investigated in terms of both visual and mental functions, including quality of life, cognition and depression. Such an investigation has not been performed previously and can have a significant impact on vision rehabilitation both nationally and internationally."
NCT03165630,"Background: Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in Singapore, and studies have found that intensive specialized stroke rehabilitation can improve post-stroke functional outcomes for a substantial proportion of stroke patients. However, despite the benefits associated with adherence to prescribed rehabilitation, the uptake rate of outpatient rehabilitation services (ORS) in Singapore is only 33%.

According to local longitudinal studies, the financial burden of out-of-pocket service costs and the inconvenient transportation from home to rehabilitation centres are important barriers to access to ORS.

Objective: To examine the effect and cost-effectiveness of providing incentives for ORS to improve the uptake of ORS compared to usual care (control) with no incentives

Hypothesis: An evidence-based program to test the effectiveness of providing incentives to alleviate the financial burden as well as inconvenience of transportation for ORS will improve the uptake of and adherence to ORS among stroke patients.

Methodology: This study is an individual-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 300 stroke patients recruited from Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and Changi General Hospital (CGH). They will be randomized to one of three study arms (education only, free transportation, and free services and transportation) and interviewed at the time of recruitment and four months after the enrolment in the study. Participants' health conditions, socioeconomic situation, health & medical services utilization, stroke-related disability measures, quality of life, and reasons for uptake/rejection/withdraw from the services will be collected during both baseline and the 4th month assessments.

Significance: As the first study in Singapore to test innovative ways to increase the stroke ORS uptake rates, it will provide evidence for future policy changes in financing outpatient rehabilitation and other long-term care services in Singapore. It will also provide important empirical parameter estimates for Systems Dynamics modelling of the demand and supply of ORS in Singapore."

Proximal anterior circulation occlusion is associated with a particularly poor prognosis, but its management has undergone a paradigm shift following clinical introduction of endovascular recanalization, establishing rapid reperfusion of the ischaemic penumbra.

Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is highly effective at attenuating cerebral infarction in basic research studies and has the potential to further improve patient outcome if used as an adjunct to invasive revascularisation strategies. We aim to trial remote ischaemic conditioning at the time of revascularisation, and then daily for the duration of the seven-day in-patient stay, compared to a sham conditioning procedure. This pilot, single-centre study will determine efficacy/ tolerability of RIC to reduce cerebral infarction (primary endpoint: determined by brain magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and improve functional status (secondary end-points: National Institutes of Health Stroke Severity (NIHSS); European Quality of Life questionnaire EurQoL), with the data providing the necessary parameters for power calculations and leveraging charitable funding for a subsequent multi-centre study."
NCT03122002,"Through 5 years continuous observation of acute ischemic stroke patients in Neurology Department of Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, clinical data about emergency treatment (neurological score, examination and treatment), medical data after admission (neurological score, inspection, examination and treatment) and long-term prognosis (neurological score) was collected. The outcomes were set as the score scale, all blood test index and examination index of the research objects at specific period after illness. Through statistical analysis and comparison of different in-hospital clinical data in predicting the outcome of the patients, our study will provide more evidence-based solutions for the treatment and prediction of acute ischemic stroke."

It will be evaluated that whether 3d virtual reality rehabilitation training provides any benefit to stroke rehabilitation."
NCT03354052,"Pain is a common symptom experienced by people following stroke and can significantly interfere with participation in the activities of daily living and adversely affect health-related quality of life. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) promotes the modulation of brain activity and its prolonged and continuous application can effect plastic modification. Combining rTMS with rehabilitation treatment for primary motor cortex activation (using Gloreha® device) may have effect in reducing pain in stroke survivors. This is a pilot randomized control trial to test the effects of rTMS in stroke-related pain rehabilitation, its efficacy on pain, upper limb function, sensory function and autonomy in daily livings activities. Furthermore, we will explore the effects on pressure pain threshold, cortical excitability and EEG recording."
NCT03555643,"The research project investigates the incidence of the hyperintense acute reperfusion marker (HARM) in patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or transient neurological attack (TNA). Initially, HARM was described after acute ischemic stroke and is caused by a blood-brain barrier disorder after recanalization of an acute vessel occlusion and consecutive reperfusion. These result in a contrast agent extravasation into the subarachnoid space, which can be easily detected on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images.

TIA is defined as a transient focal neurological deficit with a probably cerebrovascular cause. In contrast, TNA is defined as a transient non-focal neurological deficit with multiple causes, including cerebrovascular. The clinical diagnosis of TIA is often flawed and the delineation of TIA and TNA can be difficult. MRI is the most important diagnostic method for the detection or exclusion of cerebral ischemia in patients with TIA/TNA in daily clinical practice. However, on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) approximately two-thirds of TIA cases and only one-fifth of TNA cases demonstrate acute cerebral ischemia. Supplementary perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) scans can only slightly increase this percentage. The well-known HARM could prove to be complementary to DWI and PWI and close or at least reduce the existing gap. In the case of TNA in particular, this could be of clinical relevance in order to avoid mistreatment or even dismissal without further clarification after supposedly inconspicuous imaging.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to record the incidence of HARM in a statistically significant number of cases of patients with TIA and TNA and to investigate relationships with symptom duration and anatomical localization. In addition, the dynamics of contrast enhancement in the subarachnoid space in TIA and TNA cases with HARM will be analyzed in detail."

NCT01644929,"Rehabilitation after stroke improves motor functions by promoting plastic changes however, after completing standard rehabilitation, 50-60% of patients still exhibit some degree of motor impairment and require at least partial assistance in activities of day living. Therefore, the exploration of other approaches to promote recovery is compulsory. Non invasive brain stimulation and motor rehabilitation are thought to share similar mechanisms in inducing neuroplastic changes in the human cortex and an emerging field of research is focusing on the possibility of coupling both therapies in order to achieve an additive effect and improve outcome.

We hypothesize that coupling bihemispheric transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with simultaneous physical/occupational therapy in the subacute phase of ischemic stroke patients may improve upper limb motor recovery in humans.

This is a randomized, controlled, double blind, cross-over, multicentre, clinical trial. Thirty-six ischemic stroke patients in the subacute phase will be recruited in three centers of neurorehabilitation in Switzerland. After stratification based on the Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity according to the severity of the deficit, the patient will be randomized to receive besides standardized physical/occupational treatment according to the Impairment-Oriented Training, tDCS of themotor cortex (1.5 mA, 30 minutes) (group 1: 12 patients) or sham stimulation (without current) (group 2: 12 patients). After three weeks of treatment group 1 and 2 will cross-over and will be treated for other three weeks. Group 3 (12 patients) will receive routine physical/occupational treatment and sham tDCS for six weeks. Assessment will be performed before starting tDCS, at week 3, 6 and at 6 months. Outcome measures are the Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity, the extended Barthel Index, the Ashworth scale, the Test of Upper Limb Apraxia (only baseline, week 6, month6), the grip strength evaluated by the Jamar Hydraulic Hand dynamometer. At baseline at week 6 and at month 6 depression will be assessed by the Hamilton depression Rating Scale."

It is important to prescribe the correct dose of blood thinners to the right patients to ensure the treatment works however avoiding complications. In the recent years, new blood thinners have been available; they require less laboratory tests and fewer visits to a doctor compared to older therapies. This study will look at how the general practitioners in the UK prescribe blood thinners according to the instructions given by the product manufacturer. We will use primary care data that is routinely collected by the general practitioners about their patients but without any possibility to identify individual patients. The results will help us to understand the magnitude of deviation from instructions in order to ensure that the patients benefit from the treatment."

The goal of the quantitative strand is to assess changes in quality of movement and functional use of the paretic lower limb after the treatment and investigate the participants' expectations in regards the intervention using the Participant Opinion Survey (POS). The qualitative strand (participant interviews) will determine perspectives of caregiver and participant perspectives regarding protocol acceptability. Both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected and analyzed concurrently, through triangulation and complementarity rationales; both data will be equally prioritized."

NCT03107637,"The ESUS concept was introduced recently to describe a non-lacunar stroke of undetermined etiology. The following etiological workup is required in this setting: head CT or MRI, 12-lead ECG, transthoracic echocardiography, continuous cardiac monitoring for at least 24 hours after stroke, vascular imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance angiography, CT angiography, catheter angiography). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is considered not to be required.

However, aortic arch atheroma as diagnosed by TEE in the setting of recent ischemic stroke is a major aortic source of embolism, as supported by numerous well conducted studies. The European Association of Echocardiography considers that TEE is the gold standard for the diagnosis and the characterization of aortic atheroma. It is also the method of choice for the diagnosis of infectious endocarditis.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the rate of patients with a therapeutic modification induced by TEE (mainly anticoagulation and surgery), in consecutive patients admitted with ESUS at our institution stroke unit."

NCT03106909,"Pneumonia commonly complicates stroke and has a profound impact on clinical outcomes. Accurate and timely diagnosis of pneumonia complicating stroke remains a major challenge as several issues potentially confound diagnosis. Chest X-ray (CXR), a central component in the diagnostic work-up, may have limited utility in the early stages as they are often of suboptimal quality, and infrequently confirm typical diagnostic infiltrates. Blood biomarkers of the stress-immune response have received considerable attention, but interpretation has been limited by differing methodologies, including definition of pneumonia. Bacterial organisms in the oral cavity may also be of relevance as biomarkers of post-stroke pneumonia. Major challenges facing frontline clinicians are therefore whether to initiate antibiotics; if so, when and for how long. These issues have antibiotic stewardship implications for clinicians in terms of potential for under-treatment or over-treatment with antibiotics based on CXR appearances.

Pulmonary Computed Tomography (CT) could be of value as a radiological reference standard when pneumonia is suspected after stroke, and enable more rigorous evaluation of the diagnostic performance of CXR (and other candidate biomarkers) to inform decision-making when pneumonia is suspected.

The overall primary aim is therefore to investigate the feasibility and reliability of using pulmonary CT as a radiological reference standard for evaluating suspected pneumonia complicating stroke. The secondary aims are to explore the diagnostic accuracy of CXR and blood biomarkers (index tests) when pneumonia is suspected during hospital admission after stroke using pulmonary CT as a reference standard."

NCT05369637,"The occurrence of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a minor stroke is frequently assumed as a temporary and non-disabling event. Nevertheless, patients can experience subtle but meaningful impairments, including a decreased performance in activities of daily living (ADLs), a high prevalence of depression, cognitive decline, physical deficits, hearing degeneration, with implications in returning to work, social relations and activities. Additionally, it has been described a higher risk of stroke among these patients, which highlights the importance of promoting secondary prevention, soon after these acute episodes. Therefore, this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate the feasibility and the effectiveness of a three-month multidomain intervention program, composed of five non-pharmacological components which may contribute to accelerate the return to the pre-event level of functioning in patients with TIA and minor stroke. The results may guide future clinical practices and health policies aiming to reduce the overall burden of stroke."

NCT03072524,"The aim of this study is to develop and validate a simple prehospital stroke scale, which would predict the presence of large vessel occlusion (LVO) in patients with acute stroke. This study prospectively evaluates the predictive value of a new simple pre-hospital scale (FAST PLUS test) for the presence of large vessel occlusion in anterior intracranial circulation. The FAST PLUS test consists of two parts: the first is the well-known FAST test, which is employed in all possible cases of stroke occurrence. This test consists of the following items: Speech (scored 0-1), Facial palsy (0-1), any failure of Arm motor function (0-1), and Time (0-1). The second part of FAST PLUS test evaluates only the presence of severe arm or leg motor deficit (scored 0-1) and unilateral occurrence of its motor function deficit (scored 0-1).

The FAST PLUS test will be used prospectively at the place of stroke onset by trained medical emergency technicians. The first objective of study is to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and the positive and negative predictive value of the test which relate to the presence of occlusion of intracranial artery (intracranial carotid artery, T occlusion and occlusion of Middle Cerebral artery segment M1 and M2). CT angiography can only diagnose the LVO.

The second objective of this study is to assess inter-rater variability among stroke specialists and emergency technicians, concerning the presence of severe motor arm or leg deficit.

Because this arm must serve as the primary controller, these deficits can be functionally devastating. The investigators now hypothesize that the combination of severe paresis (Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Score ≤35) and persistent motor deficits in the non-paretic arm limits functional independence in chronic stroke survivors. The investigators predict that remediation, focused on the non-paretic arm should improve functional independence. The investigators propose a randomized study design with two tracts, two periods and four assessments. The investigators envision this study as the first step in establishing the basis for a rehabilitation approach that focuses on remediation of BOTH arms, which constitutes a substantial change from current remediation protocols focused only on the contralesional arm."

NCT03056287,"This project will assess the effects of aerobic exercise training (AET), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or their combination on depressive severity as well as locomotor function in persons with post-stroke depression (PSD). Both AET and rTMS are established stand-alone treatments for non-stroke related depression, though neither has been adequately studied post-stroke. Furthermore, substantive research indicates that AET improves post-stroke locomotor function, thus offering a novel approach for treating PSD as well as an established vehicle to study the effects of PSD on response to rehabilitation.

The purpose of this project is to determine the impact of AET, rTMS and their combination (AET+rTMS) treatments on post-stroke depressive symptoms and locomotor function so as to guide the development of a future clinical trial. A total of 40 depressed post-stroke subjects will be randomly assigned to one of four groups 1) AET; 2) rTMS; 3) combined AET and rTMS (AET+rTMS) or 4) control (sham rTMS) group (n=10 per condition; equally distributed with mild and moderate MDD). Further, an additional 10 non-depressed post-stroke subjects will complete 8 weeks of AET so as to allow us to determine the effects of PSD on response to training (Aim 2). Training (AET, rTMS and AET+rTMS) will take place over an 8-week period, three times per week on non-consecutive days. Measures of depression (HRSD17) as well as self-selected walking speed (SSWS) will be performed prior to the initial treatment session of each week as well as 8 weeks following cessation of treatment. Additional measures of locomotor function (walking endurance and amount of daily community stepping) will be assessed prior to training (pre), following 4 weeks of training (mid), upon completion of 8 weeks of training (post) as well as 8 weeks following cessation of training (follow-up), allowing determination of the efficacy (and persistence) of training on these outcomes."

It is fast, portable, safe and inexpensive, but currently has a relatively poor spatial resolution. It produces images of the internal electrical impedance of a subject with stroke or head injury using rings of ECG like electrodes on the skin. EIT recording will take place as early as possible, usually within 24 hours of admission. Following completion of the recording, the EIT images will subsequently be analysed and compared to other imaging data for accuracy."

NCT03048292,"Endovascular treatment has recently become the recommended therapy for acute stroke after the publication of five randomized trials (MR CLEAN1, ESCAPE2, EXTEND IA3, SWIFT PRIME4, REVASCAT5) in 2015 that demonstrate its efficacy. Hospitals need to adapt to these updated stroke care guidelines, and many hospitals are not appropriately equipped for neurointerventional procedures. Decreased time to treatment is associated with favorable clinical outcomes, and best practices to optimize workflow between comprehensive stroke centers and secondary hospitals have become an important area of study. This prospective study is being conducted on acute stroke cases within the Mount Sinai Health System from 1 June 2016 up until 31 December 2018. The researchers would like to evaluate how variable methods of interventional service delivery for acute stroke affect clinical measures and outcomes.

More specifically, the researchers are conducting this study in order to determine whether outcomes of neurointervention for large vessel occlusion in stroke, for patients presenting to and receiving treatment at a comprehensive stroke center, will be superior to that delivered by a mobilized intervention team at a central satellite hospital. In particular, the hypothesis is that factors affecting outcome include presentation to secondary hospital, delays with transfer including traffic conditions and time of day, and the acquisition of complex imaging within secondary hospitals."

NCT03063970,"Stroke is the major cause of complex adult disability in the UK. Upper limb impairment contributes to disability and fewer than 15% of survivors regain full arm and hand function by 6 months. Consequently, many stroke survivors have difficulties with activities of daily living where good upper limb and hand function is required. Upper limb impairment also predicts quality of life and independent functioning after stroke. It is therefore vital that effective therapeutic interventions to improve upper limb recovery are found.

Various therapeutic interventions to improve arm recovery after stroke have been proposed, however although effective in some circumstances, many have been proven as unacceptable and unfeasible in usual rehabilitation practice. The aim of this study is to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of Dynamic Lycra Orthoses (DLO), as an adjunct to usual UL rehabilitation and to examine the magnitude, direction and variability of any effects on upper limb impairment and functioning.

This inexpensive, commercially available, CE marked, tailor-made lycra sleeve garment is worn for up to 8 hours a day and during rehabilitation therapy. The DLO has not been extensively studies in stroke rehabilitation, but existing evidence suggests that the garment may enhance sensory feedback and correct upper limb movement and positioning, facilitating conditions for recovery without the need for direct therapist supervision. It may therefore augment the effects of standard dose of Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy, and self-directed practice.

This is a feasibility, randomised, controlled trial. Using 2:1 randomisation, We will recruit and randomise 60 participants with mild, moderate and severe UL impairment who have been admitted to Ninewells Hospital or Perth Royal Infirmary, Tayside, Scotland with a stroke affecting the upper limb to receive usual care or usual care plus the DLO. The DLO will be worn daily for up to 8 hours over 8 weeks. A blinded rater will collect outcomes data examining upper limb functioning, strength, dexterity, sensation, use of the arm for daily functioning and quality of life at the end of the intervention and at follow-up eight weeks later. Data relating to duration and frequency of DLO wear, proportion of eligible participants, and those willing to be randomised, drop-outs and losses to follow-up will also be recorded to assess feasibility of a full-scale trial."

StartReact responses triggered by a loud acoustic stimulus (LAS) during the planning and preparation of goal intended actions has been used to probe the state of brainstem neuronal excitability related to posture and movement sequencing. The purpose of this study is to examine posture and goal-directed movement planning and execution using startReact responses and to evaluate posture and UE movement sequence during reaching while standing in individuals with chronic hemiparesis and healthy controls. Secondly, the investigators will determine the modulatory role of the cortical premotor areas (PMAs) in startReact responses in healthy controls and in persons with stroke by using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to up- or down-regulate PMAs excitability."

NCT04236089,"Mirror therapy has recently attracted increasing attention; however, most patients have the difficulties to perform mirror therapy due to limited imaginary ability. A mirror robotic hand system was developed, which consisted with a wearable exoskeletal hand, sensor glove, and a control box. The patient's unaffected hand wears the sensor glove, the affected hand wears the wearable exoskeleton hand, and the unaffected hand does the certain transitive and intransitive tasks as the mirror group, and then makes the affected hand do the same movements driven by the exoskeleton robotic hand. The investigators hypothesize that combining both approaches might facilitate the sensorimotor cortex that controls movement and might augment somatosensory input and further treatment efficacy. This study is aimed at investigating the effects of Mirror therapy and robotic mirror therapy on motor cortical activations in healthy adults and stroke patients using electroencephalography. All participants will perform the conditions of resting, moving right hand with or without robotic hand as the baseline data, then they will do mirror therapy using the right hand as active hand, or wearing robotic hand doing mirror therapy in random sequence. Electroencephalography (EEG) assessment will be done to assess the neurophysiologic effects of the different interventions. The investigators will use a questionnaire to assess the subjective opinion about the different interventions.

NCT05479006,"Significant motor impairments occur in 80% of individuals after moderate to severe stroke and impact the body side to the lesioned hemisphere. Typical motor impairments involve loss of dexterity with highly prevalent upper limb flexion synergy. Advances in treating flexion synergy impairments have been hampered by a lack of precision rehabilitation. Previous studies suggest and support the role of cortico-reticulospinal tract (CRST) hyperexcitability in post-stroke flexion synergy. CRST hyperexcitability is often caused by damage to the corticospinal tract (CST). We hypothesize that: 1) inhibiting the contralesional dorsal premotor cortex (cPMd) will directly reduce the CRST hyperexcitability and thus, reduce the expression of the flexion synergy; 2) facilitating the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (iM1) will improve the excitability of the damaged CST, therefore reducing the CRST hyperexcitability and the flexion synergy. we propose to use a novel targeted high-definition tDCS (THD-tDCS) to specifically modulate the targeted cortical regions for testing his hypothesis, via the following aims: Aim 1. Evaluate the effect of cathodal THD-tDCS over the cPMd on reducing the CRST hyperexcitability and the expression of flexion synergy. Aim 2. Evaluate the effect of anodal THD-tDCS over the iM1 on improving the excitability of the CST, and determine whether this, thus, also reduces the CRST hyperexcitability and the flexion synergy. Aim 3. Evaluate the confluence effect of bilateral THD-tDCS, i.e., simultaneous cathodal stimulation over the cPMd and anodal over the iM1."

NCT01453010,"Arm and hand weakness as a result of stroke occurs in approximately 70% of stroke survivors and causes huge loss of function and independence. A wide range of treatment approaches have been developed to improve motor recovery. Despite treatments, such as Constraint Induced Movement Therapy, showing promise, these in large have been have focused on high-intensity and repetitive task-specific practice. Patients with little hand or finger movements however may not be able to participate actively in task specific training.

The SaeboFlex is a dynamic orthosis, with a spring-loaded feature that facilitates opening of the fingers and hand. This allows the patient to grasp and release objects repeatedly, hence enabling participation in repetitive task practice and increasing potential for motor recovery. Despite the SaeboFlex being used successfully in several centers in the country and internationally, research to provide evidence of effectiveness is scarce. As a consequence funding for the SaeboFlex is limited and usually requires patients' to fund their own.

The study aims to explore the potential benefits and feasibility of participating in a Self-directed SaeboFlex training program to allow repetitive task practice in patients early after stroke.

Subjects will undergo a 12-week training program comprising of a maximum of 3 x 45 minute sessions a day. Activities focus on grasping and releasing balls and reaching for targets, wearing the SaeboFlex for the majority of the session. At the end of each session the SaeboFlex is removed and the hand is incorporated into functional tasks as able. Subjects will be set individualized training program by a Saebo-trained therapist. The program will be graded and progressed at a rate that is appropriate to each individual.

The study will measure and follow-up 8 subjects to explore improvements in recovery and functional ability of the upper limb and affect on dependency levels. It will also explore the level of intensity patients early after stroke can tolerate and how they participate in self-directed therapy. All patients will meet the inclusion criteria and be motivated to undergo the specific SaeboFlex self-directed training program. Subjects will record the time and intensity of their training sessions and also their routine upper limb therapy. Patients will be assessed before, during and after the 3 months training.

NCT03666806,"Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is a common hereditary haemoglobin disorder in Africa. World wide it is estimated that about 300,000 newborns are born every year. Of which 75% of them live in Sub-saharan Africa (SSA). In Uganda, about 15,000 babies are born with sickle cell disease per year.

In Uganda, the stroke prevalence was found to be 6.2% in children admitted to the National referral hospital in Kampala. Notable between 21 to 30% of these children presented with co-morbidities such as anaemia, bacteraemia and painfull crisis. Stroke in SCA is mediated by several mechanism such as cellular adhesions, inflammatory markers, hemolysis associated oxidative stress and hemostatic activation. Stroke in SCA is primarily a large vessel stroke and the mechanisim state above lead to a narrowing of the lumen of the cerebral arteries Arterial ischaemic stroke which occurs frequently in children with SCA has been associated with bacterial infections. Recent studies have shown that minor infections such as flu like infections can play a critical role in the trigger of stroke in children.

Our hypothesis is that viral flu infections is a key trigger for the risk of stroke in children with SCA. Our objective is to prevent the occurrence of flu illnesses in children with SCA thereby reducing the risk for stroke in our population of children with SCA.

Methods: A randomized controlled double blinded study Study site: The study will be conducted at the Sickle Cell Clinic (SCC), Mulago Hospital. Inclusion criteria: will be ;age between 2 years and 12 years;All children whose parents will have consented and those above 7years will have to assent. Exclusion criteria: all children with previous strokes; children who have acute illness and are not clinically stable; any child with previous documented adverse event following immunization (AEFI).

Sample Size: Using Open EPI calculator for cohort studies we calculated a total sample size of 136 participant to achieve our objective. Using a 95% confidence interval, power of 80% and an unexposed outcome of 25% (4) using a ratio of 1:1. Each arm will have 68 participants.

NCT03923946,"Individuals who have had a stroke are at greater risk of developing distress (e.g. depression and anxiety). These individuals are also likely to be highly critical of themselves as they are no longer able to do the things they used to be able to do.

Compassion Focused Therapy is a form of psychotherapy aimed at reducing an individual's self-criticism and increasing their self-compassion. CFT has been found to be effective at reducing distress in the general population and there is emerging evidence in the brain injury population. However, to date, there has not been a rigorous study to establish the effectiveness of CFT. Therefore, this feasibility randomised control trial aims to:

Establish the feasibility of recruitment, randomisation, and retention of participants; determine the acceptability and feasibility of a CFT intervention within a stroke population; determine the suitability of pre and post measures for assessing the impact of the intervention; Analyse the cost-effectiveness of the study; Establish effect sizes to enable an accurate estimation of the number of participants needed in a full scale RCT to find a treatment effect.

Individuals will be randomised into either a CFT intervention group, an active control arm (akin to a befriending type service) or a treatment as usual arm. Participants will receive up to three one hour sessions of CFT (intervention group) or befriending (active control group) or will not receive any additional support (treatment as usual group).

A total of 36 participants will be recruited, 12 in each arm of the study. Participants will be recruited from the Early Supported Stroke Discharge Teams within Derbyshire.

Participants will complete well-being, distress and self-criticism measures, pre, post and at 4 months follow-up. A semi-structured interview will also be conducted with a selection of participants from each arm."

NCT04657133,"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) results from the rupture of small vessels damaged by chronic hypertension, amyloid angiopathy or other disease. Currently, ICH has been a devastating type of stroke that lacking effective therapy. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC), a systematically protective strategy, has been found to have neuroprotective effects by in patients with ischemic stroke. In addition, animal studies show that RIC is safe in ICH model and it could accelerate the absorption of hematoma. In a previous clinical study (RICH-1), RIC have been found to be safe and well-tolerated in patients with ICH. Therefore, the investigators plan to undertake this study to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of RIC in patients with ICH.

The investigators hypothesize that treatment with RIC will accelerate the absorption of hematoma and improve patients' functional outcomes. Results of this study can potentially bring into account new means to improve the outcomes of ICH patients."

NCT04904172,"Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive technology that continuously monitors regional tissue oxygenation (tissue saturation with oxygen). NIRS is used to evaluate the oxygen saturation of the brain and other tissues (such as muscle, liver, lung). NIRS is a non-invasive, simple, bedside method that can be used safely in stroke patients, as it is a method that can be performed at the bedside and does not affect the treatment process. The NIRS, which we will use in our study, continuously measures with the help of two electrodes affixed to the forehead area, right and left.

There are previously created scales and scales based on neurological examination in the follow-up of patients with acute ischemic stroke. The main ones are the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), which is used without evaluating the patient's consciousness; It is the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), which is used to evaluate the severity of ischemic stroke, its suitability for treatment and treatment response, and the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), which is used to evaluate the daily activity ability of individuals. However, since these cannot predict the patient's response to treatment and complications that will develop early, and there are no objective parameters, there is a need for methods that require objective monitoring of the patients.

Acute ischemic stroke patients who received intravenous thrombolytic therapy with NIRS and / or who underwent endovascular thrombectomy are monitored for 24 hours and the data obtained from this method are compared with the vital findings, GCS, NIHSS, mRS, which are traditionally used in the follow-up of these patients.

The disease is responsible for stroke and cognitive decline associated with motor disability. The number of incident lacunes, and amount of cerebral atrophy were recently found to have a strong relationship to cognitive decline and disability progression over 3 years in a large sample of patients. Palm tocotrienols has previously shown evidence of therapeutic effect in attenuating the progression of WMH related to sporadic cerebral small vessel disease in a randomized controlled clinical trial. We hypothesize that palm tocotrienols complex (HOV-12020) can reduce the clinical progression in CADASIL."

NCT04728776,"BACKGROUND Knowledge about the perceived impact of stroke on survivors' lives is still scarce in Pakistan due to the lack of translated and culturally adapted self-rating scales. The stroke impact scale is a comprehensive self-reported outcome measure designed to assess the quality of life following the stroke. Although the psychometric properties of SIS found to be superior to the conventional generic quality of life scales, it has not been translated and tested in Pakistan.

OBJECTIVE To translate and cross-culturally validate the Urdu version of stroke impact scale 3.0 for Pakistan MATERIAL AND METHODS Established guidelines were followed for translation and adaption of the Stroke impact scale 3.0. A prospective cohort of 116 patients with mild to moderate stroke self-reported their recovery on the Urdu version of SIS 3.0. The patients were concurrently evaluated on the established scales to assess the validity using the Spearman correlation coefficient. ANOVA was used to determine the discriminant validity. Ninety patients were consecutively re-evaluated to determine the test-retest reliability, precision, minimal detectable change (MCD) and clinically minimally important difference. The coefficients of ICC, Cronbach's alpha, and weighted kappa were calculated to establish the stability and consistency of the scale. The receiver operating curve was used to estimate the MCID of SIS-16 using global rating scale as an anchor.

NCT02248233,"Massive cerebral infarction is an ischemic stroke caused by complete blockage of the internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery, or their cortical branches. The widespread infarction, pathological severity and high fatality rate associated with massive cerebral infarction pose a major threat to affected patients. However, there is a lack of unified diagnostic criteria. Many researchers use Adams' classification, in which massive cerebral infarction is diagnosed when the following criteria are met: infarct size > 13 cm2; a major brain-feeding artery is involved; the focal site affects more than two cerebral lobes; infarct diameter line ≥ 3 cm in internal capsule of striatum.

Prolonged cerebral ischemia/reperfusion can induce complex secondary changes in brain tissue, so the use of neuroprotective agents is very important. Remarkable progress has been made over the last decade in understanding the protective effect of calcium antagonists against cerebral ischemia. In particular, the liposoluble dihydropyridine Ca2+ antagonist nimodipine selectively acts on cerebral vessels and neurons and can protect ischemic brain tissue, providing a new way of treating ischemic cerebrovascular disease.

Preclinical and clinical tests have shown that nimodipine has a protective effect on ischemic brain tissue, and indicate that patients should take the drug as soon as possible. However, there are no reports of double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials addressing the administration of nimodipine via intravenous drip within the time window for successful treatment of acute massive cerebral infarction."
NCT01725919,"Constraint-induced movement therapy (CI therapy) is a highly efficacious treatment for residual motor disability in chronic stroke. Its effectiveness is believed to be due, at least in part, to the therapy's ability to aid the brain in ""rewiring itself."" For example, CI therapy produces increases in the amount of grey matter (the parts of the brain where neuron cell bodies are most closely clustered) in certain areas of the human brain (Gauthier et al., 2008). The cellular and molecular mechanisms that are responsible for this increase in grey matter volume are not known, however. Thus, it is unclear how the therapy helps brains ""rewire"" themselves. This study aims to better understand the timecourse and cellular/molecular nature of brain changes during CI therapy. Because there is currently no way to directly measure cellular/molecular changes in the brain noninvasively, this study will infer what is happening on a microstructural level using new MRI techniques (three dimensional pictures of the brain). For example, by charting the timecourse of grey matter changes during CI therapy, and cross-comparing this to what is known about the timecourses of different cellular/molecular processes, the investigators can gain a greater understanding of what cellular processes may be responsible for increases in grey matter. The investigators will gain additional information about which cellular processes are important for rehabilitation-induced improvement by measuring larger-scale changes (e.g., amount of blood flow through different brain areas) that accompany cellular changes. The investigators are hopeful that by better understanding how CI therapy can change the brain, the effectiveness of rehabilitation can be improved upon. For example, insight into the mechanisms of rehabilitation-induced brain change may suggest particular drug targets to increase brain plasticity. This study will help us better understand how the brain repairs itself after injury."

NCT01726218,"It is well known that the motor area of one hemisphere of the brain (motor cortex) controls the movement of the opposite of the body. However, it is not clear whether as the movement becomes more complicated, the motor cortex of both hemispheres of the brain are involved. Currently the role of the motor cortex on the same side of the body (referred to as ipsilateral motor cortex) in hand performance remains controversial. The investigators demonstrated previously in healthy subjects that transiently lowering the activity of ipsilateral motor cortex improved the performance of the opposite hand. What is not know are the mechanisms involved in these changes of behavior. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a device that allows the non- invasive stimulation of the brain. When brain is stimulated repetitively at a very low rate and low intensity for about 15 minutes, the stimulated brain area becomes less active. This effect lasts 10 minutes and is called a ""transient artificial lesion"" as it mimicks the effects of transiently interfering with the function of the stimulated brain area. In the present study the investigators will conduct experiments using repetitive TMS to downregulate the activity of the motor area as in previous experiments and measures its effect on activity of motor cortex of both hemispheres. The investigators will study healthy subjects. It would be important to understand the effects in more detail for the design of treatment strategies in patients after stroke, which will be a topic of future studies."

NCT05106595,"Recent studies have shown that completing bilateral simultaneous movements during upper extremity practice may result in facilitation of coactivation and interhemispheric activation of both the ipsilesional and contralesional brain areas, with one limb entraining the other and enabling the limbs to function as a unit. Other research has proposed that the use of virtual-reality (VR) activities during treatment sessions can improve upper extremity function following stroke as it is motivating, challenging, offers external feedback that may facilitate motor learning, and allows for the ""high-intensity, repetitious practice necessary to drive recovery"". Coupling bilateral simultaneous upper extremity movement and virtual-reality activities is the Bimanual Arm Trainer (BAT), a non-powered mechanical device by which the non-paretic upper extremity moves the paretic arm. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the Bimanual Arm Trainer (BAT) compared to traditional occupational therapy treatment sessions as these relate to upper extremity functional return following stroke, as measured by scores on the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) and Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment (UE-FMA) measures. The investigators plan to use retrospective data for a pre-implementation group, comparing this data to prospectively collected post-implementation data. ARAT scores are routinely collected and will be used for comparison between groups. UE-FMA measures are commonly used in this area of research, and will be taken to provide additional context for the post-implementation group."

NCT04121013,"Background: The outcome of ischemic stroke is related to the brain lesion volume and this volume of infarction is directly related to the time to reperfusion, which therefore depends on the time to initiation of therapy. Acute ischemic stroke is treated medically with the administration of intravenous rtPA, but recent randomized controlled trials have shown the efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy and is now the new gold standard in ischemic stroke. This new therapeutic strategy has created two possibilities for pre-hospital decision-making: i/ transport the patient directly to the nearest stroke unit to receive alteplase and then if indicated perform a thrombectomy (drip and ship) or ii/ bypassing thrombolysis centres in favour of endovascular thrombectomy (mothership).

Objective: To compare cost/effectiveness of transfer to the closest local stroke centre or telemedicine hub to direct transfer to the comprehensive stroke cent(CSC) in patients acute stroke with suspected large vessel occlusion.

Medical and economic expected impact: We hypothesize that direct transportation to CSC is associated with better clinical outcome in case of acute ischaemic stroke due to intracranial large vessel occlusion. However, we have to demonstrate that this approach is not associated with time from onset harm in patients not eligible to mechanical thrombectomy."

NCT01405378,"Every five minutes someone in the UK has a stroke. It is the main cause of long-term disability among adults in the UK despite a fall in age-specific stroke incidence, with a growing number of survivors remaining dependent for activities of daily living. While most people with stroke regain walking ability, upper limb problems with no voluntary arm and hand activity, affecting a third of people after stroke, has a poor prognosis. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive procedure used to polarise brain regions through the application of weak direct currents and has the potential to develop into a useful aid to treatment strategies in neurorehabilitation. Recent literature into the application of tDCS in people with arm and hand impairments after stroke has shown promising results on upper limb function measures like the Jebsen-Taylor hand function test. Furthermore, a recent pilot study evaluated a six-week training programme combining tDCS with robot-assisted hand training and reported significant improvements in upper limb function. However, the robot in the latter study focused on single-plane distal movements only and long-term effects of the tDCS were not assessed. Recent robotic developments included robots with three rotational degrees-of-freedom for the upper limb, but the effectiveness of this type of robot combined with tDCS in early stroke settings is unknown.

NCT03571152,"Stroke is the second cause of death and third of disability in the adult population, By 2020 it is projected like the fourth cause of disability-adjusted life year (DALY) and by 2030 it is estimated that it will lead the global burden of morbidity from chronic noncommunicable diseases. As a consequence of stroke, patients show a certain degree of dependence and spend most of their time with a caregiver, especially since the subacute phase of the stroke. 80% of patients who survive have motor problems. The proper care during the first three months will significantly improve until 95% the patient rehabilitation. Caregivers have reported the need for information about clinical, prevention and treatment of stroke, like information about specific tasks of patient care, mobilizations, exercises, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to train and educate the caregivers in physical aspects of care, recovery and secondary prevention. However, oversaturated health systems, insufficient number of specialists, social inequity, limited coverage and speed of access to health services are factors that make difficult to educate caregivers. Studies have demonstrated that the Information Technology applied to health is a promising solution to educate and empower the patient, carer and family. For instance, the use of educational videos to improve the level of practice or knowledge of patients with chronic pain and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This project aims to evaluate the efficacy of the use of educational videos for caregivers of patients in subacute phase of stroke through of the change of the level of practice, knowledge and satisfaction."
NCT04413240,"In the last few years, there has been an increasing shift towards outpatients setting in the care of patients with stroke. Unfortunately, this led to a high percentage of discharged patients who did not receive an adequate amount of rehabilitation, because of some non-clinical factors, such as resource availability, geographical location, age, and personal wealth. To date, there is growing evidence about the role of telerehabilitation as an effective method to deliver rehabilitative treatments to homebound subjects with no moving of therapists or patients. However, the most appropriate organizational models regarding Health Technology Assessment in telerehabilitation procedures still object of debate. On these bases, the aim of this project is to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of multi-domains telerehabilitation procedures in stroke patients in order to supply the National Health Service with some useful information about the use of telerehabilitation in clinical practice of stroke rehabilitation."

NCT04718064,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a common type of stroke in the elderly. Timely blood flow recovery can effectively improve the long-term prognosis of patients. According to five large-scale multicenter randomized controlled trials (MR clean, swift-prime, revascat, escape and extend-ia) in recent years, the effect of endovascular therapy (EVT) for acute anterior circulation occlusion of great vessels is significantly better than that of drug therapy alone. Therefore, for patients who meet the ""Chinese guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke"" (2018 Edition), the effect of EVT is better than that of drug therapy alone, Intravenous thrombolysis within 4.5 hours and endovascular mechanical thrombectomy within 6 hours can effectively relieve the clinical symptoms and reduce the mortality of AIS. However, due to the narrow application time window of intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, although the thrombectomy time window of some eligible patients was relaxed to 24 hours after dawn and defuse3 and other related studies, the reperfusion injury after the blocked cerebral artery recanalization has brought huge obstacles to clinical application. Therefore, how to improve the prognosis of patients with endovascular therapy has become a hot research direction.

Fingomod is a kind of sphingosine analogues acting on sphingosine-1-phosphate (sipr). After phosphorylation in the body, fingomod combines with lymphocyte SIP receptor, changes lymphocyte migration route, prevents it from entering the area outside the lymphoid tissue, so as to avoid its infiltration into the central nervous system and achieve immunosuppression. Currently, it is the first-line disease modifying oral drug for multiple sclerosis. Fingolmod shows neuroprotective effects on many central nervous system diseases including cerebral ischemia. Fingomod not only reduced the number of lymphocytes invading the brain, but also decreased the number of lymphocytes in the microcirculation system"

NCT01810562,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether tactile stimulation for reduced sensibility of the affected extremities after stroke has effect.

Hypothesis:

Stimulation of sensibility after stroke will have a significant contribution for improved sensibility. Without any stimulation, no signal is sent to the brain and there is no need for the healthy parts of the brain to adapt this function. Stimulation of the sensibility over a period of time on both sides of the body, gives the brain signals and the opportunity to compare how the signals should be recognized. New connection will be able to interpret signals correctly."
NCT01812421,"Patients with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke or TIA (ISTIA), who are treated at hospital are asked to participate in our pre specified hypertension health education protocol (HHEP) after discharge from our hospital.HHEP was used as secondary prevention treatments of stroke and cardiovascular diseases.

HHEP consists of several items such as controlling the patient's hypertension level, monitoring the adherece of antihypertensive agents, reducing risk factors of hytertension like tobacco smoking, obesity, and motivating the patient to physical activity and to a healthy diet.

Patients will receive visits by a study nurse with the aim of supervising, monitoring, and recording the adherence of HHEP. The patients will be classified as different adherence level at the end of the study according to their adherence condition.

This study is aimed at testing the hypothesis that controlling hypertension and its risk factors was more effective than those do not receive HHEP in reducing the recurrence of stroke and cardiovascular diseases."
NCT01811550,"The Insights on Selected Procoagulation Markers and Outcomes in Stroke Trial (I-SPOT): Response to Insulin Administration and Blood Glucose Control proposal is designed to accompany the Stroke Hyperglycemia Insulin Network Effort (SHINE) clinical trial, a Phase III multicenter, randomized, controlled trial planning to determine the efficacy and validate the safety of glycemic control in stroke patients. The SHINE trial will recruit 1,400 AIS patients with Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hyperglycemia, each receiving 3 days of hyperglycemia control with intravenous (IV) insulin therapy or control therapy with subcutaneous (SQ) insulin. The I-SPOT trial will recruit 315 SHINE patients. Blood coagulation marker levels will be measured before and at 48 hours after the start of treatment. Baseline and temporal changes in biomarkers levels will be compared between treatment groups.

Hypothesis: The decrease in levels of markers of blood coagulation will be greater in patients treated with IV insulin to reduce BG than in patients treated with SQ Insulin as the standard fashion.

Hypothesis: The decrease in levels of markers of blood coagulation will be greater in patients with than without favorable (SHINE) outcome (defined as the baseline stroke severity adjusted measure of functional ability at 90 days after AIS).

Hypothesis: Hyperglycemia control modulates the relationship between blood coagulation levels and functional outcome in T2DM patients after stroke. Patients treated with IV Insulin for hyperglycemia control with favorable (SHINE) outcome will have greater decreases in blood coagulation levels than either IV Insulin-treated patients without favorable outcome or SQ Insulin-treated with or without favorable outcomes at 90 days after AIS."
NCT01827436,"The purposes of this pilot research study are 1. To begin to test if two different types of physical therapy might have different results in children and adolescents who have had a prior stroke, and 2. To determine if either type of physical therapy causes changes in the brain signals that control leg muscles. All participants will receive physical therapy 3 times per week for 8 weeks. Half of the participants will receive typical physical therapy, such as walking practice, muscle strengthening, and balance training. Half of the participants will receive asymmetrical gait training physical therapy, which uses new technology to train each leg differently during walking practice. After enrolling, participants will be randomly assigned to the type of therapy. Measurements will be taken before, during, and after the 8 weeks of physical therapy. These include walking tests to measure symmetry, walking speed and daily step activity, and brain tests to measure the strength of the signals from the brain to the leg muscles. One blood test is also taken to identify if certain genetic factors affect how each child responds to the physical therapy."

NCT04756570,"Stroke has been defined by the World Health Organization as a condition with rapid onset and vascular origin, leading to a focal or global deterioration in brain functions lasting 1 day or longer. Stroke is an important health problem affecting a large part of the society with its high frequency and mortality. Post-stroke disability reduces the patient's quality of life and causes socioeconomic and social problems. Post-stroke hemiplegia often causes a decrease in the ambulatory ability of the patient. As a result, the patient's independence to move inside and outside the home is negatively affected. Gait is one of the most affected sensorimotor functions in stroke patients. Although the majority of patients strive to walk independently, they cannot reach a level of independent walking sufficient to perform activities of daily living (ADL). Current studies emphasize that the intensive early rehabilitation program is effective in treating patients with gait and movement disorders. Rehabilitation programs with a multidisciplinary approach are the most effective options that can be applied to increase a patient's functional status and post-stroke independence. Robotic-assisted walking devices are one of the current and effective methods used to regain ambulation."

NCT04700553,"Background and objectives: Lower extremity functional impairments are common consequences of stroke. Thus, continuous examination of effective treatment interventions for lower extremity functions after stroke is a necessity. Localized muscle vibration (LMV) is one of the treatment interventions that incorporate sensory stimulation to improve motor cortical excitability. This study aimed to investigate the influences of 10-minutes lower extremity LMV application along with conventional physical therapy (CPT) on activities of daily living (ADL) and motor recovery on the hemiparetic lower extremity post-stroke.

Methods: A sample of 37 patients with stroke (8 females) was randomly allocated to either conventional physical therapy (CPT) control group (n=18) or conventional physical therapy and localized muscle vibration (CPT+LMV) experimental group (n=19). All patients received 3 sessions per week of CPT for 8 weeks. The CPT+LMV experimental group received 10-minute LMV at the end of each CPT session.

Patients who have follow-up with telemedicine will be compared with patients following up in the usual way, by coming to clinic, and will have the same expectations for medical care and lifestyle changes like quitting smoking, exercising, and controlling their cholesterol. The study will try to show those stroke patients who live 75 miles or more from Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) and use a computer for follow up: 1) Will be able to complete the recommended visits using telemedicine in the home as well as those who come to clinic; 2) Will have blood pressures controlled at one year's time as well as those who follow up in the usual way by coming into clinic; 3) The patients followed with telemedicine will be as satisfied with the type of follow up they had as those followed in the usual way in the clinic. In the future, more patients who live at a distance from a major hospital might be able to get quality stroke care follow up using telemedicine if the study finds that telemedicine does meet these goals."
NCT01864382,"The stroke as cerebrovascular disease is the leading cause of permanent neurological disability and the third death in the Western world. Their affected often have motor and sensory disturbances in the form of hemiparesis with a possible influence on the balance be altered trunk muscles, important components of postural control. The treatment of stroke, covers a wide range of different strategies and approaches physiotherapy, including, specific exercises on the trunk called ""core stability"", performed by the patient with the help and supervision of a physiotherapist specializing in neurology, that are based on coordination, motor and proprioceptive work, especially the lumbar-pelvic. The effectiveness of these last years has been demonstrated empirically, but until now there is no sufficient evidence of the effects of these exercises on sitting balance in respect, and standing up in the subacute phase post-stroke patients. To prove the evidence raises a randomized, multicenter, blinded and where the evaluator will not participate in the analysis and processing is done by intention to treat. Patients will be divided into two groups: control (usual physiotherapy center made ) and experimental (made also 15 minutes workout ""core stability""). The intervention will have a frequency of 5 days a week for 5 weeks and up to 12 weeks. The expected effect is that the experimental group patients develop better postural control at the trunk and this influences the balance in sitting, standing and walking."

NCT02251470,"BACKGROUND: Virtual gaming systems offer new possibilities for home-based exercises (HBE) in rehabilitation. Pilot studies with stroke patients indicate that the application of Nintendo Wii® (WII) is practicable and can improve balance under clinical conditions. However, larger trials are necessary to verify these positive effects after discharge from the hospital.

AIM: This study aims to prepare and optimize a phase III trial which compares the effects of two HBE programs for stroke patients.

METHODS: A pilot study with randomized control design and repeated measures over three-months will be conducted. Twenty elderly stroke patients will be randomly allocated to an experimental group (EG) and a control group (CG). All participants will receive an introduction to a HBE program by an individual mentoring over 6 weeks. During the following 6 weeks the participants perform the HBE on their own. The EG will perform a balance exercise program using the WII, the CG will perform a balance exercise program without technical support.

Recruiting potential, the participants' acceptance of the intervention and economic aspects will be examined. Additionally, basic information about sensitivity of change and potential effect sizes regarding the proposed instruments to measure mobility are expected."
NCT01894529,"Stroke is accompanied by local inflammatory response and systemic immunosuppression. Immunosuppression markers are associated with the occurrence of medical complications (infections), whereas inflammatory markers are associated with worse functional prognosis.

This prospective study tries to validate in acute stroke patients the prognostic usefulness of a panel of immune biomarkers that have previously been associated with various clinical outcomes.

The identification of beneficial and harmful immune responses in cerebral ischemia will allow the prediction of the clinical course of the patients and will be helpful in designing immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies for acute stroke."
NCT04458779,"Stroke affects 16.9 million individuals each year and is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Despite advances in pharmacologic therapy, morbidity , mortality and rates of hospitalization for stroke remain high. These data emphasize the importance of identifying all treatable conditions that could aggravate stroke. One such condition is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Sleep-related breathing disorders, including obstructive and central sleep apnea, often coexist with stroke. Compared to the general population, in whom OSA is the most common form of this breathing disorder with recent prevalence estimates of 22% of male and 17% of female , in the stroke population, the prevalence of OSA is much greater at 70% . Several randomized controlledtrials on OSA patients with stroke in acute or sub-acute stage showed that treating OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) improved motor and functional outcomes, accelerated neurological recovery.Apart from the benefits in better neurological outcomes, secondary analyses of SAVE study suggested that CPAP treatment potentially help to reduce recurrence of stroke. Nevertheless, we don't have evidence yet from randomized control studies to prove CPAP treatment would reduce the recurrence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events.

Traditionally, recurrence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events uses documented mortality, morbidity or hospitalization for heart failure, acute coronary syndrome or stroke as clinical endpoints. Recently, several studies showed that enlarged left atrium (LA) can serve as a predictor for recurrent stroke or cardiovascular events. On the other hand, a growing body of studies demonstrated that CPAP treatment reduce size of LA in those with OSA. Notably, all of these studies above are observational or retrospective in nature. To date, there are no prospective longitudinal randomized controlled trials reporting the effect of CPAP treatment of OSA on the change of size of LA. We therefore will undertake a randomized , controlled trial involving patients with stroke to test the primary hypothesis that treatment of OSA with CPAP would reduce the size of LA."

NCT03930719,"For a long time, delirium was considered a merely temporary dysfunction of the brain. Today, it is established that it is a brain disease associated with network dysfunction, neuroinflammation and impaired transmitter homeostasis in a multicausal model. Following an episode of delirium, many patients do not return to their prior level of cognitive and functional performance. In particular, failed or delayed diagnosis with consecutive inadequate therapy contribute to the development of long-term cognitive decline that may ultimately lead to long-term care. Stroke patients are a particularly common delirium-affected population (10-46% depending on severity). Despite the frequency and clinical relevance of delirium in stroke patients, diagnostic characteristics of common screening methods are unknown. Similarly, the clinical phenotype and risk factors of patients who develop delirium have not been adequately described.

This study primarily aims to evaluate the diagnostic properties of established screening tools for delirium in a prospective cohort of well-characterised patients following ischemic cerebral events (either transient or manifest stroke). Secondary outcome criteria include predictors of post-stroke delirium (PSD) such as stroke location and size, pre-stroke cognitive functioning, ability to participate in daily routine activities and medical conditions."
NCT01906463,"This study should also raise questions about the interest and feasibility of establishing a permanent registry of CVA in the Antilles and Guyana. Indeed in coming decades, the expected doubling of the population of persons aged over 60 years and the foreseeable changes in lifestyle will increase the burden of this disease, in particular since the region is marked by a high prevalence of arterial hypertension and diabetes and a high level of precarity. In addition, this study will provide epidemiological information on CVA, its risk factors and management, which are non-existent for the department of French Guyana where the health environment is manifestly insufficient. These data should make it possible to better evaluate the resources available and the healthcare needs in Guyana."
NCT01910454,"Stroke is the most serious disabling condition in the United States and the developed world. Novel stroke rehabilitation approaches, such as task-specific training, have shown promise in improving an individual's recovery in the rehabilitation setting; however, evidence suggests that these improvements are not generalized or transferred to the home, community, or work settings. Thus, these interventions usually do not impact overall health and participation outcomes. This research study seeks to improve task-specific training as a stroke rehabilitation approach by integrating it with evidence-based cognitive-oriented strategies which have shown great promise as a way to address the limitations of task-specific training. The new treatment protocol is called Cognitive-Oriented Strategy Training Augmented Rehabilitation, or COSTAR. The hypothesis of this study is that COSTAR will result in more efficient functional skill acquisition, better long-term retention of skills learned, and generalization and transfer of skills learned to home, community, and work settings."
NCT01941147,"There is great interest in the development of novel therapies for acute ischemic stroke because, to date, the thrombolysis is the only approved treatment. Recent evidence suggests that extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) could be an alternative approach for acute ischemic stroke therapy because of their effects on the main mechanisms of brain ischemic damage and regeneration.The main purpose of this open label, one arm, dose escalation study is the validation of ELF-MF stimulation as non-invasive, safe and effective tool to promote recovery in acute ischemic stroke patients Nine patients will be treated daily for 5 consecutive days, starting within 48 h from the onset of stroke. Three dose cohorts of three patients each, will be stimulated with pulsed ELF-MF (75 Hz, 1,8 mT) at increasing daily exposure (45, 120, 240 min).The primary outcome (safety endpoint) will be evaluated by the incidence of adverse events and mortality throughout the stimulation period and the 1-year follow-up.

Secondary prevention is proven efficient but observational studies have shown that a number of patients are lost to follow up and do not receive recommended prevention. The aim of the study is to 1) describe, by analyzing register data, the detection rate of patients with hospital diagnosis of stroke, TIA, and atrial fibrillation in the primary care center where they are listed. The analysis is done by sex, age, and socioeconomic status. Furthermore, rate of dispensed prescriptions of secondary preventive drugs are analysed for the identified population. 2) in a randomized controlled study evaluate if collegial feed back and targeted information of secondary prevention to the intervention group can improve the detection rate and the medication of the patients listed at the participating primary care centers."
NCT02254616,We hypothesize that (1) the hybrid therapy will induce greater improvements on some health-related outcomes compared to other therapies; (2) such benefits will retain at 6-month follow-up; (3) better motor control and brain reorganization will be found in the hybrid therapy than the other therapies; (4) correlations will be found between brain activity and movement kinematics/health-related outcomes.

NCT03530358,"For this project the investigators ask, how the activation and organization of muscle synergies may be disrupted by brain lesions, and whether it is possible to modify synergy activations by means of specific therapies. Will be investigated whether there is a relationship between post-stroke cortical plasticity and changes in synergy activations due to a therapy."
NCT03546959,"Upper extremity splints are one of the nonpharmacologic treatments used to treat hypertonicity after stroke. The purpose of splinting is to support, to position, to immobilize, to prevent contracture and deformities, to reduce spasticity and to enhance function. Dynamic lycra splints have been found to improve spasticity, posture, and fluency of upper extremity movements in computerized analysis systems due to the effects of neutral warmth, circumferential pressure and by creating a low intensity prolonged stretch on hypertonic muscles , all of which contribute to increased sensory awareness of the involved limb. These splints are frequently used in the field of neurological rehabilitation, but there is not enough scientific evidence about their efficacy. It was demonstrated that lycra sleeves have positive effects on upper extremity function of children with cerebral palsy. Lycra sleeves for upper extremity function after stroke is a relatively new field of research.

The aim of this study is to investigate effects of dynamic lycra orthosis as an adjunct to botulinum toxin-a injection of the upper limb in adults following stroke."

NCT04830163,"After stroke, people often have difficulty using their hands. Combined brain and nerve stimulation can strengthen the neural pathways that control hand function. In this study, we will deliver combined brain and nerve stimulation during specific time windows that increase activation of neural pathways underlying hand function. We will compare the effects of combined brain and nerve stimulation during these optimal time windows to the effects of combined brain and nerve stimulation applied during random time windows on post-stroke hand function."
NCT05415150,"Acute stroke afflicts nearly 700,000 patients in the US and is the number 3 cause of death. Only 2-9% of this large number is treated with t-PA if they arrive within 4.5 hours. An equally small percentage of patients with large vessel occlusion undergo thrombectomy.

The thrombectomy patients may or may not receive t-PA. Some of these patients rarely receive intravenous GPIIB/IIIa inhibitors. Many lines of evidence suggest that GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, a class of FDA approved potent platelet inhibitors that have been used extensively along with heparin for acute coronary syndromes (heart attacks) and unstable angina (chest pain), may be safe enough to give in these circumstances."
NCT05414227,"In this study, the clinical data of patients with AIS were collected, 16s RNA was used to detect the composition and diversity of intestinal flora, and flow cytometry and mass spectrometry were used to detect intestinal flora-related metabolites in plasma，to explore the influence of gut microbiota and its metabolites on stroke prognosis."
NCT01951612,"Stroke is a leading cause of disability; most strokes (80%) are subcortical, with ischemic damage due to occlusion in penetrating arteries. Although ischemic white matter disease (iWMD) may lack gross clinical manifestation, it causes significant cognitive impairment, particularly on measures of executive function, attention, and memory. This impairment is attributable to diffuse damage affecting network connections.

While there are many studies concerning rehabilitation of motor function and language in patients with large focal strokes, few studies have addressed attentional and executive functions. To our knowledge, there are no such studies on iWMD. In this study, patients will be randomized to a novel intervention for improving executive function and a control condition matched for therapist exposure. Patients will be assessed pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at long-term follow-up using a battery of behavioural and neuroimaging tasks. We predict that the novel intervention will be associated with improved executive function, as assessed behaviourally, and improved frontal network function, as assessed through neuroimaging markers."
NCT04188522,"This is a study using magnetoencephalography (MEG) to look at recovery in those with minor stroke. The investigators know that these individuals report difficulties in attention, concentration, multi-tasking, energy level, and processing speed that appear to be independent of lesion size or location. The underlying pathophysiology is unclear; however, anecdotally, many individuals are significantly improved by 6 months post-stroke. One hypothesis is that a single lesion, regardless of size, may disrupt the classic neural networks required for cognitive function. The investigators are currently collecting data to better characterize these difficulties and stroke patients' recovery as part of a previously approved recovery study. In this sub-study, the investigators propose to add MEG at 1 and 6 months in a subset of individuals with small: 1) subcortical, and 2) cortical lesions. The investigators will partner with colleagues at the University of Maryland (College Park), who are well experienced with MEG to conduct this research. In addition a control population of age-similar individuals will be recruited for comparison. Cerebral activation patterns of individuals with stroke versus controls will be compared, both across patients with stroke at a given time point, and within subjects from 1 to 6 months to determine the association of abnormal activation with cognitive dysfunction and recovery.

**The investigators have recently extended follow-up by adding an additional assessment at 12 months and will enroll additional participants (up to 40 patients with minor stroke, 15 age-similar controls)."
NCT03257696,"Quality of care depends strongly on oral communication with patients. Stroke patients, who have language disorders, have understanding difficulties, but also have difficulties in expressing their needs and in being understood. Available tools do not allow a professional consensus on the assessment of patients' ability to answer reliably to questions asked by caregivers. The investigators propose an answer reliability assessment tool based on yes or no questions. The goal of the present study is to define an optimal score for defining the test positivity, as a compromise between sensitivity and specificity, and by emphasizing the negative predictive value."
NCT02900833,"Clinical and experimental data suggest that neutrophil activation and extravasation are deleterious in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) involving an increased risk of unfavorable outcome and hemorrhagic transformation (HT). However, clinical trials targeting neutrophil recruitment in AIS patients were negative. Recently, an experimental study has shown that neutrophil activation and transmigration begin immediately after the occlusion.

NCT01947413,"The fundamental goals of early rehabilitation for patients with stroke are: optimizing motor function within each patient's prognostic potential, preventing the development of secondary conditions that impact life-long health, and promoting patient's participation in their lives. In addition to employ clinical measures after treatment, usual outcome measures employed in the intervention studies included movement kinematics (spatio-temporal characteristics of movements). Recent reports have suggested repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and BoNTA (BoNTA) improved motor function in patients with stroke. A novel rTMS paradigm, theta burst stimulation (TBS), including intermittent TBS (iTBS) and continuous TBS (cTBS), that modulates human cortical excitability differently. However, there is lack of literatures in verifying the treatment effect by the integration of clinical and kinematic analysis. Until now, there are no conclusive results regarding optimal rTMS protocol, such as stimulating pattern and for patients with stroke. Additionally, few studies investigate the possible clinical characteristics of patients with stroke that may influence the effects of various treatment protocols proposed in this project."

NCT02205424,"Stroke and dementia are two of the most common and disabling conditions worldwide, responsible for an enormous and growing burden of disease. There is increasing awareness that the two conditions are linked, with cognitive impairment and dementia common after stroke, vascular dementia accounting for about one-fifth of all dementia cases and recent evidence on the contribution of vascular risk factors to Alzheimer's disease. Yet little is known about whether brain volume loss - a hallmark of dementia - occurs after stroke, and whether such atrophy is related to cognitive decline. The aim of this research is to establish whether stroke patients have reductions in brain volume in the first three years post-stroke compared to control subjects, and whether regional and global brain volume change is associated with post-stroke dementia in order to elucidate potential causal mechanisms (including genetic markers, amyloid deposition and vascular risk factors). The hypotheses are that stroke patients will exhibit greater brain volume loss than comparable cohorts of stroke-free controls, and further, that stroke patients who develop dementia will exhibit greater global and regional brain volume loss than those who do not dement. An understanding of whether stroke is neurodegenerative, and in which patients, may be used to help guide the early delivery of disease-modifying therapies."

NCT01949961,"BACKGROUND: Thrombolytic drugs may dissolve blood vessel clots in acute ischemic stroke. The overall benefit of intravenous thrombolysis is substantial, but up to 2/3 of patients with large clots may not achieve re-opening of the vessel and up to 40% of the patients may remain severely disabled or die. Ultrasound accelerates clot break-up (lysis) when combined with thrombolysis (sonothrombolysis) and increases the likelihood of functional independence at 3 months. Adding intravenous ultrasound contrast (gaseous microspheres) further enhances the thrombolytic effect (contrast enhanced sonothrombolysis = CEST). Contrast enhanced ultrasound may also accelerate clot break-up in the absence of thrombolytic drugs (contrast enhanced sonolysis = CES).

HYPOTHESIS: Contrast enhanced ultrasound treatment administered within 4 1/2 hours after symptom onset may be given safely to patients with acute ischemic stroke, both to those receiving intravenous thrombolysis and those not receiving intravenous thrombolysis, and will improve clinical outcome.

AIMS: To compare efficacy and safety of contrast enhanced ultrasound treatment vs. no ultrasound treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke receiving or not receiving intravenous thrombolysis.

STUDY ENDPOINTS: The primary endpoints are 1) neurological improvement at 24 hours (proof of concept) and 2) excellent clinical outcome at 3 months (effect). Secondary endpoints are bleeding complications (safety), brain damage (infarct size/location) and early clinical improvement (effect)."

NCT01950338,"Stroke is the leading cause of physical disability, particularly due to the presence of spasticity. Different needling techniques, including the use of Botulinum Toxin A are proposed for the management of spasticity. The presence of spasticity in the lower extremity implies several impairments for standing and walking inducing high disability. No study has investigated the effects of deep dry needling inserted into the targeted spastic musculature in patients with stroke. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of a single session of deep dry needling over the musculature of the leg on spasticity, widespread pressure pain sensitivity and plantar pressures (baropodometry) in individuals with chronic stroke. The investigators hypothesize that patients receiving a single session of dry needling would exhibit a greater reduction in spasticity and pressure sensitivity than those who will not receive the intervention."
NCT01954290,"Stroke remains the fourth leading cause of death in the United States (second worldwide) and a leading cause of long-term disability, resulting in total direct and indirect costs of approximately $73.7 billion annually. The failure of novel therapies in clinical trials demonstrates that the complex neural response to stroke must be targeted at multiple levels to improve patient outcomes. Despite significant improvements in stroke treatment and management, 1 year survival rate among stroke patients aged 65 years or more is around 25%, and 5- year survival rate amounts to approximately 50%. The highest chances of death are within 30 days of stroke. Mortality increases due to worsening brain dysfunction, elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), and other comorbid conditions.

Treatments aimed at reducing post-stroke cytotoxic edema may reduce the risk for development of malignant stroke and mortality. Current treatments such as osmo-therapy and hemicraniectomy have substantial limitations, and mortality remains high, despite these measures outcomes remain unsatisfactory. There is a great need for alternative medical approaches which are safe, predictable, and help to ameliorate post stroke edema."

NCT04639453,"Context:

After stroke, most patients suffer from hemiparesis with variable functional consequences that can strongly impact autonomy in daily activities. Motor recovery is, therefore, an essential part of the therapeutic strategy in order to optimize the patient's capacities and functional autonomy.

Some authors suggest that trunk control would be essential in the capacities of standing balance, transfer tasks and gait. However, no studies have tested the reliability and validity of proprioceptive and sitting balance clinical tests for patients with post-stroke hemiparesis. These tests would be very useful in advancing our understanding of trunk impairments and for clinicians to manage an appropriate treatment strategy.

Objective:

The main objective is to assess the reliability of the Trunk Positional Sense Test, the unstable sitting test with forceplate and the Modiﬁed Functional Reach Test (MFRT) in individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis. The secondary objectives is 1) to assess the validity of the Trunk Positional Sense Test and the unstable sitting test with forceplate, 2) to assess the validity of a phone inertial captors to assess the instable sitting.

Method. - Thirty-two individuals with subacute post-stroke hemiparesis will be included in this study. After clinical tests (trunk strength, Balance Assessment in Standing and Sitting, Timed Up and Go test), the MFRT, Trunk Positional Sense Test and unstable sitting will be evaluated by two physiotherapists in a ﬁrst session (inter-rater reliability). After a rest of 2-4 h, a second similar session was conducted with the first physiotherapist (intra-rater reliability). For unstable seated balance, two tools will be used: the force platform and a smartphone.

Reliability will be tested by calculating the intraclass correlation (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis. For trunk positional sense test and unstable sitting test, the validity will be tested with correlations with each clinical test. The validity, between forceplate variables and inertial phone variables, will be tested with correlations.

Perspectives. - The promotion of quality tests to assess patients in clinical practice is essential. The results of this study should provide knowledge for selecting the best trunk control tests to assess the individuals after stroke and to understand the influence of trunk control on functional activities."

NCT04637737,"Asymmetric gait patterns of stroke is one of the most important functional activities to enable community participation, it is major goal for stroke patients. Reported that the stroke patients had asymmetry at stance time, single stance, double support time, and swing time compared to normal people, and claimed that the most important factor was step length. According to Albert et al., patients with an asymmetric gait pattern have a long double support phase and a healthy side single support phase, and less weight shift to the affected side. Recent studies have shown that visual feedback for weight shift may be helpful to obtain a symmetrical posture after stroke. However, no study has been conducted on the therapeutic effect on gait asymmetry and patterns. We aimed to investigate the effect of Anterioposterior Weight Shifting Training with Visual Biofeedback in subacute post-stroke patients on gait asymmetry and pattern.

NCT03869138,"Neurological impairment is a devastating disease for patients and their families and a leading cause of adult disability. Traditional rehabilitative therapies can help regain motor function and ameliorate disability. However, health care reimbursed rehabilitation is usually provided for up to 6 months post stroke (3 months in form of inpatient therapy and 3 months in outpatient therapy). There are increasing community and other facilities offering rehabilitation in form of conventional, recreational and alternative (Yoga, Tai-chi) therapy. However, implementation of these conventional therapy techniques in individuals with neurological disorder impairments is tedious, resource-intensive, and costly, often requiring transportation of patients to specialized facilities. Based on recent evidence suggesting significant benefits of repetitive, task-orientated training, investigators propose to evaluate the feasibility of an alternative dance and gaming based virtual dance and gaming based therapy to improve overall physical function of community-dwelling individuals with neurological impairments, compared to conventional therapeutic rehabilitation. This pilot study aims to systematically obtain pilot data on compliance and efficacy as well as performing power analysis and sample size calculation for developing it into a randomized controlled trial for extramural funding purposes.

In the proposed China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke II (CATIS-2), the investigators will recruit 4,776 patients from 100 hospitals within the China-US Collaborative Stroke Clinical Trial Network. Eligibility criteria for the trial participants include age ≥40 years, acute ischemic stroke confirmed by CT/MRI, symptom onset between 24-48 hours, and average systolic blood pressure (BP) between 140-200 mmHg at randomization. Patients with extracranial or intracranial artery stenosis (≥70%) in both sides or the affected side, NIH Stroke Scale score of ≥21, Glasgow Coma Scale score <8, preceding moderate or severe dependency (modified Rankin scale score 3-5), revascularization, intravenous thrombolytic therapy or mechanical thrombectomy will be excluded. All eligible patients will discontinue their home antihypertensive medications. Patients admitted within 24 hours of symptom onset will require a reevaluation prior to randomization at 24 hours after stroke onset. After randomization, patients in the early treatment group will immediately receive antihypertensive treatment aimed at lowering average systolic BP by 10-20% within the first 24 hours and achieving an average BP <140/90 mmHg within five days. Patients in the delayed treatment group will discontinue antihypertensive medications for the first seven days. After seven days, both groups will receive antihypertensive treatment with a BP goal of <140/90 mmHg. The primary study endpoint is a composite outcome of death and major disability at three months.

NCT02079103,"Background: High intensity training of challenging tasks with many repetitions is a key factor for regaining motor function after stroke. Novel virtual reality (VR) rehabilitation systems provide the potential to increase intensity and offer challenging and motivating tasks. The efficacy of VR systems has not been demonstrated yet in sufficiently powered studies.

Methods: In 5 participating rehabilitation centers patients in the subacute phase after stroke will be randomized to either a group receiving 4 weeks of VR training in addition to conventional arm training or a group receiving dose-matched and therapist attention-matched conventional arm-training.

Hypothesis: VR training is more effective in improving arm motor function than conventional arm training in the subacute phase after stroke."

NCT02102269,"Shoulder pain is frequently reported as a complication among stroke patients. Muscular imbalance disrupts stability of the glenohumeral joint creating a subluxation. Stretching the soft tissue can cause shoulder pain which impedes quality of life, length of stay and rehabilitation outcome. To align the humeral head in the cavitas glenoïdalis a shoulder orthosis is often provided to the patient. Since the use of these orthoses is not always considered positive by the patient nor the therapist the question rises if the investigators can objectify if the subacromial space is reduced when wearing a sling.

Sonography is a valid way to asses subluxation of the shoulder joint by measuring the subacromial space. To objectify if an orthosis can reduce the enlarged subacromial space the investigators will use sonography to measure the distance between acromion and greater tuberosity are between acromion and the humeral head. This distance will be measured with and without the orthosis and also after a period of at least 4 hours of wearing the orthosis. This last measurement might inform us about how long the orthosis can correct the glenohumeral position. To validate the sonographic measurement X-rays will be taken by a sample of the investigators study population to compare with the ultrasound data.

Two different orthoses will be compared. First of all the actimove sling, which is standardly used in the rehabilitation centre where patients will be recruited. This sling can be adapted by the patient itself and is very easy to wear. The disadvantage is that the elbow is continuously flexed, which enlarges the risk on contractures of m. biceps and m. brachioradialis. Also the negative influence on the interpretation of the body scheme and on the quantitative use of the arm can be reasons not to wear this kind of orthosis. The shoulderlift on the other hand is a newly developed orthosis which supports the shoulder joint with the arm extended. This is a more normal position during the daily living and stimulates the use of the paretic arm. An extra adaptation can be adjusted to make it possible to position the arm flexed in order to reduce oedema of the hand if necessary. The control group does not wear any orthosis at all.

Additional the investigators will evaluate passive range of motion of the shoulder, spasticity of the upper limb (modified ashworth scale), active motion of the upper limb (fugl meyer assessment) and trunk stability (Trunk Impairment Scale) at starting point and after a period of 6 weeks wearing the orthosis minimal 6 hours a day.

If possible the investigators will do an evaluation of balance on a moving platform and an evaluation of gait with and without the orthosis after 6 weeks to assess the impact of on balance and gait."

NCT04205305,"Recent endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) trial have proven the effectiveness of intraarterial revascularization in patients with larger cerebral artery occlusion. The success rate of EVT is close to 80%, but only 50% of patients improve to independent functional outcome. Therefore, new treatment strategies are needed to reduce the futile revascularization. However, updated guidelines recommend the indications for EVT based on the results of randomized clinical trials (RCT), management of post-revascularization is largely unknown.

Current guidelines suggest that systolic blood pressure should be adjusted below 180 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure below 105 mmHg in patients undergoing intraarterial reopening. However, in the case of successful recanalization by EVT, same guideline is adopted even though the possibility of intracerebral hemorrhage or reperfusion injury by high blood pressure. On the other hand, too low blood pressure can worsen cerebral ischemia.

Therefore, this study will compare the effectiveness of active blood pressure control group (with less than 140 mmHg systolic blood pressure) versus standard blood pressure control group (with less than 180 mmHg systolic blood pressure) during the first 24 hours in patients who underwent EVT and achieved successful recanalization (TICI 2b-3). The goal is to reach the target blood pressure within 60 minutes of randomization."

NCT01876667,"Clinical pharmacy specialists are in an ideal position to assist medical teams in the management of patients with ischemic stroke. Given their extensive and specialized knowledge regarding medication efficacy, safety, and cost-effective use as well as their ability to critically review, interpret and apply the results from clinical studies to patient care, clinical pharmacy specialists have the potential to have a significant impact on stroke care delivery. There are numerous opportunities for clinical pharmacy specialists to become more extensively involved in the delivery of care to these high-risk patients. However, to-date there are few studies demonstrating the impact of clinical pharmacy specialists on outcomes of patients with stroke Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States (U.S.) and the most common life-threatening neurologic disorder.1 Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability and results in significant individual and societal financial burdens. In 2006, stroke accounted for 1 of every 18 deaths and ischemic stroke accounted for 87% of all strokes.1 In the U.S., out of the approximately 795,000 people who develop a stroke each year, approximately 185,000 (23%) are recurrent events.1 After the first year, the average annual risk for recurrent stroke is 4%.2 Patients who survive at least 30 days after a first-ever stroke, have an average annual risk of death of 9.1%, much of the risk due to nonstroke cardiovascular disease.

Despite the evidence supporting the use of various therapeutic interventions within the ischemic stroke population, a significant proportion of patients continue to have uncontrolled risk factors and remain undertreated.26-30 A recent prospective study of more than 4933 high-risk patients reported that, as compared to patients with coronary artery disease, patients with cerebrovascular disease are undertreated and thus less likely to achieve blood pressure (45.3% vs. 57.3%; p<0.001) and lipid (19.4% vs. 30.5%; p<0.001) targets.28 Although the reasons for the so-called ""treatment gap"" have not been explored specifically within this population, data from studies within the coronary artery disease population suggest that provider, patient and health care system factors likely all contribute.

This will be the first, prospective, randomized study to evaluate the impact of a clinical pharmacist disease management program on both surrogate and clinical outcomes for patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke.

This will be a randomized, controlled study comparing a clinical pharmacist-led disease management intervention by the Clinical Pharmacy Cardiac Risk Service (CPCRS) to usual care (UC)."

NCT03578250,"Post-stroke individuals continue to suffer from significant motor impairments years after the stroke. Motor recovery is usually limited to the first 6 month after the stroke, in which the majority of improvements occur at the first three months. Error augmentation (EA) training using a robotic apparatus was suggested to enhance motor recovery by exploiting the adaptation mechanisms within the intact cerebellum in individuals who sustained cortical stroke.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether error augmentation training for the upper extremity may enhance motor recovery in individuals that sustained cortical stroke.

Fifty post-stroke individuals will be randomaly assigned into either EA training (study group- SG) or robotic training in null field environment (control group- CG). Both groups will carry out the same treatment protocol on the robotic device in addition to the standard rehabilitation protocol of the rehabilitation center. Treatment protocol will be consisted of about six training sessions on the robotic device, taken twice or three times a week for two to three weeks. Each training session will be composed of 20-30 minutes upper extremity training with or without EA force field.

Motor performance will be evaluated before and after the treatment protocol by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale."
NCT03519828,"Cognitive impairment after ischemic stroke can affect not only the social adaptation ability, but also affect the comprehensive rehabilitation of patients. The damage of cognitive impairment after ischemic stroke is not lower than the body function defect after stroke. Many studies have shown that oxidative stress is one of the pathophysiological mechanisms of ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Many studies have reported that the oxidative-reduction of cells plays an important role in the life activities of organisms, affecting the health, aging and death of the organism. In the recent years, some scholars have suggested that post-stroke cognitive impairment may be related to oxidative-reduction homeostasis of the body, but the relevant evidence is lacking and needs to be further explored. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the effect of oxidation-reduction homeostasis on cognitive impairment in patients with ischemic stroke, and provide a theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment after ischemic stroke."
NCT04323501,"The study presented is part of the departmental project entitled: BEHAVIORS AND WELLNESS: A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO PROMOTE THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN VULNERABILITY CONDITIONS - winner of the MIUR grant ""Departments of Excellence"", provided by Law 232 of 2016.

The departmental project has the general aim of understanding the interaction between behaviours, motivational and psycho-biological aspects in a situation of neurodegenerative disease and/or mental distress, from which derive six different types of patients that constitute the six lines of research into which the departmental project is divided. The project, as all lines of research, is organized into two essential phases:

Phase I: the creation of basic models based on the in-depth knowledge of the molecular, structural and functional mechanisms (both physiological and cognitive) as well as on the psychological components (e.g. the ability to cope with the disease and the implementation of strategies functionals to the well-being) which are better indicative of an improvement in the health conditions of the six different patient populations studied;
Phase II: clinical-applicative integration in which studies will be carried out on the motivations and consequent behaviours in everyday life contexts. Therefore, will be highlighted actions to take place in the healthcare, educational and organizational fields, aimed to promote the implementation of the practices most clearly associated with improving the health conditions highlighted by basic research.

The peculiarity of the studies, that make the departmental project, consists in the effort to encourage translational research, multidisciplinarity and the integration of knowledge, stimulating an innovative dialogue between the different scientific disciplinary sectors present in the department. The purpose is to make evidence-based the whole path related to behaviours and strategies that promote well-being, connecting biological, motivational or behavioural aspects each other, that make it possible to recover or not worsen the conditions of health. The idea is to encourage, where possible, the implementation, even outside or in continuity with the strictly hospital context, of practices aimed at promoting the well-being and quality of life in people in conditions of vulnerability.

Each of the six research lines (1. Young patients with multiple sclerosis; 2. People with chronic brain stroke outcomes; 3. Parkinson's disease patients with symptoms of both physical and mental fatigue; 4. Preschooler population presents ""regulatory disturbances""; 5. Migrants seeking international protection; 6.

NCT03577093,"We and other investigations suggested that the activation of nerve cell cycle following cerebral ischemia led to neuronal apoptosis, glial cell proliferation and the formation of glial scar.The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclins jointly promoted the cell cycle progression. Our preliminary clinical trial found a new microRNA-miR-494, which involved in the occurrence of acute ischemic stroke. In our animal experiment, miR-494 could relieve cerebral ischemia injury through inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase 6(CDK6), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2L6 (UBE2L6) and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), which suggested that miR-494 might play an important role in the regulation of cell cycle following cerebral ischemia. This project intends to verify the following hypothesis：①miR-494 suppresses CDK6, and/or fibroblast growth factor16(FGF16)-Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase(ERK)--v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog(MYC) pathway, and/or phosphatase and tensin homolog(PTEN)-/protein kinase B(AKT)-mechanistic target of rapamycin(mTOR)-S6k pathway;②miR-494 inhibits UBE2L6, upregulates the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α(HIF-1α) expression in nerve cells, thereby increases the p21 and p27 protein levels and inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase2(CDK2)activity;③miR-494 represses HDAC3 and downregulates the cyclin-dependent kinase1(CDK1)protein level. These all mediate the cell cycle arrest of neurons and astrocytes, reduce the neuronal apoptosis and glial scar formation,promote the recovery of neurological function and provide new targets for the treatment of ischemic stroke."

NCT02197663,"The lifestyle of Taiwanese people has been changed over the past decade with the improvement of economic growth, environmental sanitation and the quality of medical care. Now the investigators pay more attention to the increasing risk of people's diseases of civilization than people's malnutrition and poor quality of environmental sanitation. The cerebrovascular accident (CVA) leads to death and bio-psycho-social dysfunction. The medical care of the patient of cerebrovascular accident cause a lot of money and is a burden of our country.

Our study emphasizes that acupuncture change bio-psycho-social aspects of the patient with cerebrovascular accident. The investigators use some scales to assess efficacy of acupuncture, such as Barthel index, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, Visual Analogue Scale, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.

Besides, the investigators notice that there are few journals about acupuncture effect of treating depression following cerebral vascular accident. The investigators may underestimate the amount of people having post-stroke depression. So the investigators use Hamilton Depression Rating Scale to Assess the post-stroke depression of cerebral vascular accident patient.

By assessing bio-psycho-social level of CVA patient, the investigators hope this study will offer them more ""Holistic Health Care""."

NCT03543280,"At present there is no consensus for post-stroke imaging except for the realization of early cerebral CT at 24 hours post-thrombolysis. The use of cerebral perfusion scintigraphy would predict the course of a stroke. Indeed, it has been shown that a good perfusion is linked to a good evolution of the neurological deficit. This test is used routinely to evaluate cerebral perfusion in patients with stroke. This technique was also used to study the mechanisms of post-stroke aphasia and to highlight neuronal disconnections after stroke, a reflection of the functioning of neural networks.

Neuropsychological tests are almost always done at 3 months. Fatigue is studied: PSF scale at 3 months, 6 months and 2 years. Research needs to be continued in this area because the pathophysiology remains unknown and the symptoms are disabling for patients. Using cerebral perfusion imaging would bring elements of understanding of this mechanism and ultimately improve the management of patients."

NCT02276729,"Individuals who have sustained a stroke are often left with residual deficits of the upper limb such as impaired movement and sensation. These deficits restrict functional use of the limb in everyday activities and can result in increased dependency upon others to engage in some tasks. Regaining independence through functional use of the arm and hand is an aim of occupational therapy rehabilitation. Mirror box therapy (MBT) is a relatively new innovation being introduced into occupational therapy interventions. Some studies have reported it to be beneficial in upper limb rehabilitation, however, these studies have not involved a sub-acute stroke population. This pilot study aims to provide robust evidence, using RCT design, as to whether this type of therapy may offer greater potential in functional gains in the sub-acute recovery period of stroke than standard rehabilitation of the upper limb alone."

NCT02223910,"Background: The technology of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) enables the monitoring of brain activity and the generation of a real-time output about specific changes in activity patterns. The recorded subject receives a feedback about the neural activity associated his/her efforts and can thus learn to voluntarily modulate brain activity. There is accumulating evidence that training of motor cortex activations with brain-computer interface systems can enhance recovery in stroke patients. Here we propose a new approach which trains resting-state correlates of motor performance instead of activations related to movements. Previous studies have shown that the more resting-state alpha oscillations in the motor cortex are coherent with the rest of the brain, the better stroke patients perform in motor tasks. Furthermore, observational studies have suggested that training of alpha-band coherence in the motor cortex with neurofeedback has beneficial effects on motor performance.

Objective : This randomized controlled study aims to test the usefulness of training functional connectivity between the motor cortex and the rest of the brain with a brain-computer interface in patients with chronic stroke. We hypothesized that this network variant of neurofeedback training will lead to region and frequency specific increases in functional connectivity and to an improved function of the affected upper extremity.

Methods : 10 patients with chronic stroke and significant unilateral deficit of upper extremity motor function will perform two periods of neurofeedback training in a randomized cross-over design. In one period, they will train alpha-band coherence between intact areas around the affected motor cortex and the rest of the brain. In a control period, they will train alpha-band coherence between a control region not directly related to motor function (the medial prefrontal cortex of the healthy hemisphere) and the rest of the brain. In each period, two training sessions per week will be performed for 4 weeks. The periods are separated by at least 4 weeks. Oscillations in the brain will be reconstructed from 128 EEG channels using an adaptive spatial filter and the coherence between the target area and the rest of the brain will be calculated in real time. Coherence magnitude will be displayed in the form of a cursor on a computer screen.

Significance: This study may provide causal evidence for a role of functional connectivity in motor learning and may lead to new strategies for rehabilitation."

NCT02289287,"Stroke is defined as a sudden vascular accident that causes brain damage and neurological impairment. Literature shows that a stroke has a negative effect on participation. Self-Management (SM) is defined as health promotion and education programs used mostly for people with chronic diseases, which aim at helping patients to maintain a feeling of wellness. The primary aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a group-based SM program for post-stroke patients in a community setting, and its contribution to improving participation, compared to standard care."
NCT02225730,"Stroke is caused by a sudden blockage of a blood vessel that delivers blood to the brain. Unblocking the blood vessel with a blood clot removal device restores blood flow and if done quickly may prevent the disability that can be caused by a stroke.

However, not all stroke patients benefit from having their blood vessel unblocked.

The aim of this study is to determine if special brain imaging, called MRI, can be used to identify which stroke patients are most likely to benefit from attempts to unblock their blood vessel with a special blood clot removal device. In particular, we will assess in this trial whether a noncontrast MR imaging sequence, arterial spin labeling (ASL), can demonstrate the presence of collateral blood flow (compared with a gold standard of the angiogram) and whether it is useful to predict who will benefit from treatment."
NCT02225834,"Recent clinical trials and meta-analyses of b-hydroxy-bmethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have demonstrated a significant reduction in ischemic stroke in patients with a history of coronary artery disease, both with and without elevations of serum cholesterol. Recent data suggest that statins have other beneficial properties in addition to the retardation of atherosclerosis. Asahi et al demonstred that Statins increased eNOS and tPA mRNA levels but did not change mRNA levels of PAI-1 and that In eNOS knockout mice, atorvastatin reduced the volume of ischemic tissue and improved neurologic outcomes after arterial occlusion by blood clot emboli. In addition to their lipid-lowering effects, it has been speculated that statins may also have beneficial effects on cerebral circulation and brain parenchyma during ischaemic stroke and reperfusion. Aslanyan et al reported that statin use was associated with reduced mortality at 1 month during the follow-up.

In patients with recent stroke or TIA and without known coronary heart disease, 80 mg of atorvastatin per day reduced the overall incidence of strokes and of cardiovascular events, despite a small increase in the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke period .

Recently the investigators group reported that lacunar strokes compared to nonlacunar ones exhibited significantly lower plasma levels of TNF-α and IL1-β, P-selectin and ICAM-1 24-72 h and 7-10 days after stroke onset (4). At extracranial arterial territories, inflammation plays a crucial role mediating all the stages of the atherosclerosis process . Similarly, thrombosis and defective fibrinolysis may also contribute to the progression of atherosclerotic lesions . Interestingly, both mechanisms might have a relevant role in the pathogenesis of intracranial large artery atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke Moreover our group showed that Patients with cardioembolic and atherothrombotic stroke subtypes showed significantly higher median plasma levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β whereas the lacunar subtype showed significantly lower median plasma levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β and that immunoinflammatory marker plasma levels are significantly related to ischemic lesion volume.

A meta-analysis showed that statins may possess antithrombotic property because these drugs were reported to reduce periprocedural infarction in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention .

This clinical benefit was detected after median, 0.5 days of treatment with statins (indicating that statins could potentially exert an antithrombotic effect even earlier than supposed from pharmacological studies.

Violi et al recently showed the first evidence that atorvastatin acutely and simultaneously decreases oxidative stress and platelet activation by directly inhibiting platelet Nox2 and ultimately platelet isoprostanes and thromboxane A2 so providinf a rationale for the use of statins to prevent or modulate coronary thrombosis.

Whereas recent data suggest that inflammatory reactions are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of cerebral ischaemia , no study has evaluated effects of atorvastatin 80 mg/day after a recent stroke on stroke outcome and on immunoinflammatory markers so to evaluate acute antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin also in acute cerebrovascular event setting.

On this basis the primary objective of the study was to evaluate the separate effects of atorvastatin in vivo on immunoinflammatory markers and on stroke prognosis in patients with recent acute ischemic stroke classified as atherothrombotic."
NCT01717755,"Rationale: Recently our study group reported the results of the Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study (BASICS), a prospective registry of patients with an acute symptomatic basilar artery occlusion (BAO). Our observations in the BASICS registry underscore that we continue to lack a proven treatment modality for patients with an acute BAO and that current clinical practice varies widely. Furthermore, the often-held assumption that intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) is superior to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in patients with an acute symptomatic BAO is challenged by our data. The BASICS registry was observational and has all the limitations of a non-randomised study. Interpretation of results is hampered by the lack of a standard treatment protocol for all patients who entered the study.

Objective: Evaluate the efficacy and safety of IAT in addition to best medical management (BMM) in patients with basilar artery occlusion.

Study design: Randomised, multi-centre, open label, controlled phase III, treatment trial.

Study population: Patients, aged 18 years and older, with CTA or MRA confirmed basilar occlusion.

Intervention: Patients will be randomised between BMM with additional IAT versus BMM alone. IAT has to be initiated within 6 hours from estimated time of BAO. If treated with as part of BMM, IVT should be started within 4.5 hours of estimated time of BAO.

NCT02309970,"CT perfusion (CTP) of the brain is an innovative technique to identify rapidly regions which are only partially or insufficiently perfused during an acute ischemic event. The differentiation between the core infarct and the still viable penumbra is its major clinical application. CTP helps directly in the decision-making process in the event of acute ischemic stroke by increasing the potential of success in patient who can benefit from thrombolytic/endovascular treatment.

The use of CTP in patient selection for thrombolytic/endovascular treatment was never evaluated in a prospective randomized study. Yet, clinical experience well demonstrated a good correlation between the size of the penumbra and the clinical outcome when done in early as well as late stages of the event.

The importance of identifying the penumbra in the acute phase of the ischemic stroke is widely accepted. But crucial evidence to support the predictive value of CTP to predict the clinical and anatomical/structural outcomes in the late phases (90 days after) is lacking.

Currently, the use of CTP is based on theoretical assumptions and expert opinions but a randomized prospective study to validate its use is lacking.

The current guidelines restrict the use of CTP trials and to patients that can't performed MRI scan."

Cancer accounts 9% of population mortality in Egypt. Nearly 108,600 Egyptians newly diagnosed with cancer each year. The interrelationship between stroke and cancer is complex. Cancer may directly or indirectly lead to stroke via: hypercoagulability, nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE), direct tumor compression of blood vessels or treatment-related effects which potentiate stroke.

The risk of ischemic stroke after chemotherapy is largely increased by the use of certain types of chemotherapy not only by cancer histologic type. Brain infarction usually a subsequent complication appears sometimes shortly after chemotherapy. Chronic radiation vasculopathy that affects medium and large intra- and extra-cranial arteries is characterized by increasing rates of hemodynamic significant stenosis with time after radiotherapy.

The study aims to clarify the relation between cancer and its treatment with ischemic stroke by discussing the different mechanisms by which a vascular insult happen causing neurological deficit.

NCT05440292,"Stroke is a global health problem and a leading cause of disability. Limitation of upper limb function occurs in 55 -75% of patients after stroke. In recent years, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), have been shown that can promote functional recovery in stroke patients, and multiple studies have reported that low-frequency rTMS stimulation on the motor areas of the unaffected hemispheres of stroke patients can significantly improve motor function of the affected upper limb. The standard procedure for TMS to determine the primary motor area is to measure hotspot, which is used as a common target for movement disorders such as hemiplegia after stroke. In the 1990s, the hands-on task activation point determined by functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) and positron emission computed tomography(PET) studies was located at ""Hand Knob"" in the primary motor area. The study found that although the hands-on task activation point was closer to hotspot, it was significantly different from hotspot. The hands-on task activation point had stronger functional connection with the whole brain, especially the motor cognition-related brain area. Therefore, this study aims to compare the efficacy of rTMS stimulation on individual rTMS targets(task fMRI activation point) with traditional hotspot in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. The regulation effect of rTMS was evaluated by using local brain function indicators and functional connections, and the longitudinal change pattern of brain function before and after treatment was observed to explore the therapeutic targets of rTMS for motor dysfunction after stroke and the mechanism of brain functional plasticity."

NCT02452502,"Emerging studies have shown that statin treatment has pleiotropic non-cholesterol-dependent effects in the setting of ischemic stroke.

Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is the only proven effective pharmaceutical treatment for hyper-acute management of ischemic stroke, in spite of the deleterious side-effects such as hemorrhagic transformation and reperfusion injury. These harmful impacts can be counteracted with proper neuro-protective therapy. In fact, the simultaneous use of an effective neuro-protective agent was proved to reduce the comorbid vascular injury of rt-PA. In experimental research, high dose of atorvastatin combined with rt-PA can significantly reduce infarct volume and improve the neurologic deficits. Previous studies showed that fewer than 40% ischemic stroke patients established early reperfusion after intravenous thrombolysis, while high dose of atorvastatin was revealed to favor the maintenance of cerebral vascular patency and integrity, most likely by reducing thrombosis secondary to rt-PA administration. Moreover, it was suggested that statin can sufficiently improve the restoration and remodeling of neurovascular unit in cerebral cortex.

Investigators thus design this study to prospectively investigate whether high dose of atorvastatin prescribed within 24 hours after IV-thrombolysis will have a synergic effect to improve neurological outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients. Moreover, investigators deemed it necessary to non-invasively monitor neuronal and vascular morphological changes in brain as an indication of functional improvement. In the investigation centers, investigators have developed and implemented novel multimodality MR imaging which can dynamically monitor neurovascular remodeling. Therefore, it is worthwhile to evaluate these MRI measurements for early prediction of neurovascular reorganization with long term functional recovery in thrombolytic stroke patients administrated with high dose of atorvastatin.

The primary target of this study is to prospectively investigate whether high dose of atorvastatin (80mg) administrated within 24 hours after IV-thrombolysis will have a synergic effect to improve neurological outcome in acute stroke patients, versus moderate dose."

The innovative approach is to investigate whether interventions which do not directly involve locomotor functions but movements similar in terms of kinematic patterns and neural commands (e.g. pedaling), or aimed at recovering an essential prerequisite for walking, such as postural control during upright stance, may improve and/or accelerate the recovery of walking abilities.

A single-blind randomized controlled study is carried out. Participants are post-acute stroke patients experiencing a first stroke less than 6 months before recruitment, with an adult age, a low level of spasticity of the leg muscles (Modified Ashworth scale <2), no limitations at hip, knee, and ankle joints, and able to sit up to 30 minutes. Subjects are randomized to one of two groups, one performing the novel rehabilitative program in addition to usual care (experimental group), and one performing usual care alone (control group).

The experimental program consists of 15 sessions of FES-supported voluntary cycling training followed by 15 sessions of balance training. Both cycling and balance training are supported by a visual biofeedback in order to maximize patients' involvement in the exercise and are performed in addition to usual care.

The control group is involved in standard physical therapy which includes stretching, muscular conditioning, exercises for trunk control, standing, and walking training, and upper limb rehabilitation.

Both training programs last 6 weeks and patients are trained daily for about 90 minutes. Cycling and balance training last about 20 minutes; thus, patients in the experimental group perform only about 70 minutes of usual care.

Participants are evaluated at baseline (T1), after the end of the cycling training or after 3 weeks of usual care (post-treatment, T2), after the end of the whole intervention (post-treatment, T3), and about 6 months after the end of the intervention (follow-up, T4)."

NCT02397018,"This is a phase one study investigating the safety of a single, intravenous infusion of banked allogeneic umbilical cord blood in subjects following an acute ischemic stroke. The cord blood infusion must be given within 3-10 days of the stroke. Follow up phone calls will occur at 1, 6, and 12 months post-infusion, and will include telephone surveys on post-stroke rehabilitation and functioning. A follow up clinic visit at 90 days will include a neurological exam, MRI, and blood tests."
NCT02415972,"Stroke, a personal, familial, and social disaster, is the first cause of acquired disability, the second cause of dementia, and the third cause of death worldwide. Its associated socio-economic costs are astronomic. The burden of stroke is likely to increase, given the aging of the population and the growing incidence of many vascular risk factors. Therefore, apart from further development of stroke prevention and treatment strategies, rational and effective tools for diagnosis, monitoring, and follow-up for stroke patients have potential high long-term clinical and economic consequences.

For neuroradiological work-up, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used as gold standard techniques to detect presence or absence, effective state, and extent of stroke. However, these techniques achieve simply a baseline study of ischemia occurred and can deliver only a snapshot of brain parenchyma and vessels. Furthermore, their rapid and actual availability, especially in primary hospitals, and their dynamic capabilities and predictive values for further infarction are poor with critically ill patients have to be repeatedly transferred to the scanning unit for each measurement. Whereas CT examination is associated with x-ray radiation and may miss early detection of stroke, MRI is associated with higher costs and not generally routinely and around-the clock available in all the hospitals. Therefore, a simple, fast, repeatable, non-hazardous, and non-invasive dynamic bedside tool for the detection of acute brain tissue hypoperfusion and monitoring for potential further infarction or efficacy of thrombolysis either by systemic intravenous thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or by selective intraarterial fibrinolysis and mechanical recanalization, both combined with or without bridging after acute ischemic stroke, is strongly needed.

A promising alternative method of diagnosing stroke represents contrast-enhanced ultrasound perfusion imaging (UPI). What makes UPI so valuable is the advantage of repeatedly and non-invasively detecting brain tissue at risk for infarction by dynamic direct brain tissue perfusion assessment and not by surrogate parameters, like blood flow velocity or vessel diameter. Because of the possibility to screen and repeatedly measure the state of perfusion, the chances increase to diagnose and monitor ischemic stroke and to define the appropriate window for treatment. The perfusion analysis would also allow determination of treatment results and guidance of rapid and adequate further therapy.

Therefore, the present pilot study in 40 patients is initiated. The objectives of this observational diagnostic cohort trial are to evaluate feasibility and practicability of repeated bedside assessments by contrast enhanced UPI in acute ischemic stroke patients and to assess whether UPI can detect alterations in brain tissue perfusion before and after recanalising therapy of strokes. Assessment of cerebral perfusion by CT or MRI serves as reference and its results are compared to UPI data."

NCT02377453,A longitudinal study of function and participation in patients with stroke: An integrated brain imaging and biomechanical analysis
NCT02383121,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) affects over 700,000 Americans every year and is the leading cause of long-term disability. Early neurological deterioration after AIS typically occurs within 72 hours of stroke onset and affects 30% of all stroke patients, who have a higher rate of death or poor outcome. Several mechanisms account for early neurological deterioration, including hemorrhagic conversion, systemic illness, cerebral edema, and seizure, but the most common cause is extension of the stroke into the ""penumbra,"" a region of salvageable brain tissue surrounding the core of irreversible ischemic infarct. The penumbra is tenuously perfused by collateral blood vessels. AIS management is primarily focused on recanalizing the occluded artery causing the stroke, but an alternative and relatively unexplored approach is optimization of collateral blood flow.

Over 60% of AIS patients present with a transient acute hypertensive response, which is theorized to be the result of either increased sympathoadrenal tone, poorly controlled underlying hypertension, or an unknown stroke-specific mechanism related to augmenting cerebral perfusion through collateral blood flow. Epidemiological data suggests worse stroke outcomes are associated with extremes of sustained hypo- or hypertension, which has led to dozens of clinical trials involving over 20,000 patients to determine if pharmacologically lowering blood pressure after AIS is beneficial. The results have been persistently neutral or negative. In contrast, there have been no major clinical trials on the efficacy of using vasopressor medications to maintain or increase baseline blood pressure after AIS, despite promising preclinical data and pilot studies that showed no increase in cerebral hemorrhage or edema. The only randomized trial of vasopressor use after AIS demonstrated an improvement in clinical outcomes, but there was no difference in mean blood pressure between the control and intervention arms, suggesting the beneficial effect was not exclusively related to induced hypertension. One possibility is that the vasopressor reduced blood pressure variability, which preliminary data has shown to be detrimental after AIS, although that aspect of neurovascular coupling has not been adequately studied in the acute phase after AIS.

The reliance on IV vasopressors, which are only administered in the intensive care unit, is a fundamental limitation of prior research. An alternative, but untested, approach is to use the oral vasopressor midodrine hydrochloride. We hypothesize that frequent midodrine dosing after AIS can optimize collateral blood flow and help salvage the ischemic penumbra. The objective of this study is to develop tools to quantify midodrine's effect on blood pressure and the ischemic penumbra."

NCT04824911,"Branch atheromatous disease (BAD) has been reported to contribute to small-vessel occlusion and is associated with a higher possibility of early neurological deterioration (END). Because the pathology of BAD is due to atherosclerosis, the investigators postulate that early intensive medical treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy(DAPT) and high-intensity statin may prevent END and recurrent stroke. The investigators hypothesise that intensive medical therapy can prevent END in BAD using aspirin, clopidogrel and high-intensity statin."
NCT02368145,"This study is being done to see if there is a relationship between stroke, post-stroke depression, and measures of inflammatory and/or stress compounds in the blood. Brain injury, as caused by stroke, leads to an inflammatory response in the brain which in turn can influence inflammatory and stress responses in other parts of the body outside of the brain. These responses can be measured by analyzing various substances in the blood and in the white blood cells. The investigators will measure these substances (cytokines, glucocorticoids) and compare them to the absence, presence, or degree of depression that the investigators will determine by neurological and psychological testing. The investigators will be drawing blood for this study on admission, at or around day 3, at or around day 7 and at or around day 90, which is not part of routine stroke care. The investigators will be asking subjects to participate in answering question/scales on these same days, some of these questionnaires are also not part of routine stroke care. Standard stroke care is being done other than blood drawing/participating in answering questions/scales. Approximately 25 people will be enrolled over one year."

NCT02360670,"Stroke affects over 125,000 people each year in the UK and leaves at least 50% disabled. Treatment of stroke caused by a blockage in a blood vessel (ischaemic stroke), with clotbusting drugs improves the chances of good recovery, but must be given within 4.5 hours of onset. Currently only a small proportion of patients who arrive in hospital within 4.5 hours are treated. This is largely due to uncertainty about diagnosis and concerns about risk of bleeding associated with clotbusting medication. Patients with mild or improving symptoms in particular are often not treated because of uncertainty about relative risks and benefits. However, around one third of these patients go on to be significantly disabled. Routine CT scanning often does not show abnormalities in acute stroke (which take hours to become easily visible), and cannot show the extent or severity of blood flow changes in ischemic stroke.

We wish to investigate the value of additional CT scanning that gives information on the blood vessels (angiography, CTA) and blood flow to the brain (perfusion, CTP) by undertaking a randomised trial. Extra scans are done in the same scanner and involve some extra radiation, injections of a contrast dye, and some extra time to acquire process and interpret. The extra scans may allow better treatment decisions for patients by increasing diagnostic certainty and by better assessment of stroke severity. However, we do not know whether the potential gains from better selection justify the resources and potential treatment delays that are involved. We will investigate whether the proportion of patients given clotbusting drugs differs between the two scanning protocols; and whether the outcomes differ, using standard measures of disability. We will also investigate whether use of different scanner manufacturers' software affect interpretation of scans."

NCT02336412,"Secondary preventative medications are prescribed to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke following ischaemic stroke. However, continuation rates can be as low as 50% and are likely to be multifactorial. One factor will be patients forgetting to take the medication or a reduced appreciation of the importance of the medication as the time from the stroke passes. Numerous approaches to improve persistence to secondary preventative medications have been tried. One simple approach is use of mobile phone text messages as a reminder for patients to take their medications. In this study, we will introduce an educational and motivational strategy to inform patients about their medications and explore whether a reminder intervention, using Short Message Service (SMS), improves adherence to antiplatelet drugs, antihypertensive medications and lipid lowering drugs. We will also explore whether this improves blood pressure and cholesterol levels in the first 3 months after stroke."

NCT04534556,"Texas Biomedical Device Center (TxBDC) has developed an innovative strategy to enhance recovery of motor and sensory function after neurological injury termed targeted plasticity therapy (TPT). This technique uses brief pulses of vagus nerve stimulation to engage pro-plasticity neuromodulatory circuits during rehabilitation exercises. Preclinical findings demonstrate that VNS paired with rehabilitative training enhances recovery in multiple models of neurological injury, including stroke, spinal cord injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, and traumatic brain injury. Recovery is associated with neural plasticity in spared motor networks in the brain and spinal cord. Moreover, two initial studies and a recently completed Phase 3 clinical trial using a commercially available device demonstrates that paired VNS with rehabilitation is safe and improves motor recovery after stroke. The purpose of this study is to extend these findings and evaluate whether VNS delivered with the new device paired with rehabilitation represents a safe and feasible strategy to improve recovery of motor and sensory function in participants with stroke."

NCT04011787,"Patients with severe strokes are often unable to be take oral diet food and fluids safely because they cannot swallow effectively. Therefore, patients need to be fed via a tube placed through the nose into the stomach (nasogastric tube). Tube feeding can be given by the intermittent (bolus) method, whereby the feed is given over a short time (15 to 30 minutes), or by the continuous feeding method, where the feed is given continuously over 10-16 hours. Nasogastric feeding can be complicated by vomiting or reflux of the feed into the oesophagus causing aspiration of gastric contents into the lung and pneumonia. Nasogastric feeds can be given continuously or as bolus feeds. Healthy people eating normally take their diet in discrete meals. The human digestive system is adapted to intermittent food intake and is likely to work best if food is provided in this pattern, but the larger volume of the feed by this method may cause vomiting and aspiration. It is unclear which method is better for allowing normal digestive processes and reducing pneumonia due to aspirated feeds. There are no trials comparing these two feeding methods in patients with acute stroke. The aim of this small study is to determine if a trial comparing the two treatment approaches is feasible in patients with acute stroke, and to collect information on the effects on feed tolerance and digestion.

In this study we will compare the effect of the bolus and intermittent nasogastric tube feeding on digestion and feed tolerance in 20 patients who need nasogastric feeding within 36 hours of a stroke. Patients will be randomly allocated to be given the feeds either by the bolus or by the continuous method for 7 days. During this time they will be examined every day. The study will examine how effectively food is digested by measuring the amount of feed given and the metabolic responses of the body by looking at changes in the level of blood sugar and digestive hormones. The investigators will also monitor complications such as vomiting, diarrhoea, and pneumonia. Patients will be randomly allocated to be given the feeds either by the bolus or by the continuous method for 7 days.

NCT04515407,The current project investigates a method called paired associative stimulation (PAS) which is known to influence nervous system function through a process called neuroplasticity. Here the investigators will target function of the ankle plantarflexor muscles because they are critically important to walking. The investigators will study adults who have walking dysfunction resulting from stroke. The study will test three ways of delivering PAS targeted towards brain-muscle connections serving the ankle plantarflexors. The overall goal is to improve functioning of the plantarflexors. The investigators believe that improving plantarflexor function will increase the likelihood of positive effects from gait retraining programs for people post-stroke. Participants will experience all three PAS methods in separate sessions. The investigators will compare differences in the size of these effects to identify the optimal method for delivery of PAS to the ankle plantarflexors. This study is a preliminary step to help us design a better clinical trial of combined PAS and gait retraining.

NCT04157179,"The purpose of this research study is to better understand how blood flow and metabolism change can influence brain development in the early decades of life.

We will examine brain blood flow and metabolism using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The brain's blood vessels expand and constrict to regulate blood flow based on the brain's needs. The amount of expanding and contracting the blood vessels can do varies by age. The brain's blood flow changes in small ways during everyday activities, such as normal brain growth, exercise, or deep concentration. Significant illness or psychological stress may increase the brain's metabolic demand or cause other bigger changes in blood flow. If blood vessels are not able to expand to give more blood flow when metabolic demand is high, the brain may not get all of the oxygen it needs. In extreme circumstances, if the brain is unable to get enough oxygen for a long time, a stroke may occur. Sometimes small strokes occur without other noticeable changes and are only detectable on an MRI. These are sometimes called ""silent strokes."" In less extreme circumstances, not having as much oxygen as it wants may cause the brain to grow and develop more slowly than it should.

One way to test the ability of blood vessels to expand is by measuring blood flow while breathing in carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide causes blood vessels in the brain to dilate without increasing brain metabolism.

During this study participants may be asked to undergo a blood draw, MRI, and potential neuropsychological assessments. It is also possible that the study team will use a special mask to control the amount of carbon dioxide the participants breathe in so they don't breathe in too much."
NCT05024292,"For patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with anterior circulation proximal large vessel occlusion (LVO), mechanical thrombectomy (MT) reduces disability in patients when it is performed within 6 h of the time the patients with a stroke were last known to be healthy and up to 24 h after stroke onset in patients selected using brain perfusion imaging. For patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with posterior circulation large vessel occlusion, MT could be benefit the patients when performed within 24 hours since onset. This is a multicenter registration study of the AIS-LVO treated with endovascular intervention under the guideline. This study will record the patients' demographic and clinical data, image data, procedure of neurointervention and outcomes in 3 months. Samples of thrombus and serum will be collected and stored for later analysis."

NCT03500250,"Rationale: Depression is a frequent complication after a stroke. In stroke guidelines several recommendations focus on early screening, and treatment off depression after stroke. Introducing clinical practice guidelines into routine daily practice however, is a difficult process. In order to make the recommendations applicable to clinical practice a toolkit was developed (the Post Stroke Depression-toolkit), which provides assessment tools for the early detection of depression after stroke, and a set of interventions in case of a positive screening for (risk on) depressive symptoms.

Objective: to investigate the feasibility of the Post Stroke Depression-toolkit in daily practice.

Study design: An explanatory mixed-methods, before-and-after study design. Study population: Nurses working on the neurological wards of one university hospital and two general hospitals in the Netherlands were included in the study. Additionally, data were obtained from patient charts."
NCT05121883,"Edaravone dexborneol, comprised of 2 active ingredients, edaravone and (+)-borneol, has been developed as a novel neuroprotective agent with synergistic effects of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory in animal models. The TASTE trial (Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke with Edaravone Dexborneol) administered edaravone dexborneol or edaravone alone to stroke patients within 48 hours after stroke onset, finding that 90-d functional outcome was better in edaravone dexborneol group. However, the TASTE trial excluded patients undergoing reperfusion therapy (i.e., intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy). Therefore, the investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy of edaravone dexborneol in addition to mechanical thrombectomy in the treatment of acute ischemic stoke."
NCT02274727,"The three-year cumulative risk of a recurrent stroke, dependent on aetiology, is up to 25 per cent. At present, preventing recurrence relies on a broad approach to reduce risk factors associated with atherosclerosis, heart disease and metabolic disorders. However, more specific interventions, such as anticoagulation and surgery or stenting, need aetiologic information. BIOSIGNAL aims to determine where the most promising candidate biomarkers can help identify stroke aetiology and also predict overall MACE, including specifically recurrent stroke. In addition, the insights gained into the processes underlying different stroke subtypes may lead to more targeted diagnostic tools."
NCT05120414,"Stroke is a disorder in which the areas of the brain that control the sensory and motor nerves are damaged due to poor blood supply to the brain. As a result of which oxygen and nutrients supply to the brain tissues is interrupted. This is either caused by infarction or a bleed in the blood arteries supplying the brain. A stroke occurs when the cerebral blood supply is disrupted, resulting in a localized neurological deficiency. At least 80% of strokes are ischemic, meaning they are caused by a blockage in blood flow, while 15-20% are caused by bleeding into the brain, known as intracerebral hemorrhage. The occurrence of the sudden neurological deficit caused by bleeding in the brain or ischemic damage gives rise to the disturbances in motion, senses, perception, language, and other such functions on the opposite side to the affected side of the brain. A randomized controlled trial was carried out on 36 chronic stroke patients. By using the sealed envelope method, the sample was divided into two groups, an experimental group and a control group. For a period of four weeks, the control group only received traditional balancing exercises including standing with feet together, standing with one foot directly in front of the other, standing eye open to eye closed, standing multidirectional functional reach and March in place and walk sideways. While the experimental group received ankle strategy exercises in addition to balance exercises which included raising and lowering heels and forefeet, heel to toe walking, stepping up and down and left right and diagonal inclination of the body during standing. Interventions were given three days weekly for four consecutive weeks. Pre and post-intervention assessment were done by using data collection tools which includes ABC Scale of balance confidence, TUG scale and 10meter walk test."
NCT01758614,"The recently published Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study (COSS) failed to show a benefit of extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery over medical therapy in patients with symptomatic hemodynamically significant carotid occlusion. Since then on, different controversies have been raised on several aspects including the study population, qualifications of surgeons and hemodynamic evaluation.

In COSS protocol, the primary inclusion population is the patient demonstrating occlusion of unilateral ICA while the contralateral ICA less than 50% stenosis. Because of the enrollment problems, in the final result report, 18% patients suffered from contralateral ICA stenosis more than 50%. As we known, COSS utilized oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) ratio by PET as the criterion of hemodynamic evaluation. Bilateral ICAs lesion will disturbed the ratio even the identifying the subgroup of patients with hemodynamic insufficiency.

As an interventional trial, the COSS should ensure the certification for the experienced surgeons. While for expanding the number of centers and enhancing recruitment, COSS made some concessions on the surgeons training and certification. The 15% postoperative event rate is not the best that can be achieved according to recent surgical technical development.

The cerebral hemodynamic insufficiency has been considered as the primary pathophysiological factor for patients with ICA or MCA occlusion. For these patients, antiplatelet therapy is not likely to prevent hemodynamic stroke.EC-IC bypass surgery probably will be the possible effective therapy.

These underlying assumptions deserved further exploration and more strict research.So the CMOSS study in China is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of EC-IC bypass surgery with medical therapy in patients with symptomatic hemodynamically significant carotid occlusion."

NCT04344626,"Refractory epilepsy, meaning epilepsy that no longer responds to medication, is a common neurosurgical indication in children. In such cases, surgery is the treatment of choice. Complete resection of affected brain tissue is associated with highest probability of seizure freedom. However, epileptogenic brain tissue is visually identical to normal brain tissue, complicating complete resection. Modern investigative methods are of limited use.

An important subjective assessment during surgery is that affected brain tissue feels stiffer, however there is presently no way to determine this without committing to resecting the affected area. It is hypothesized that intra-operative use of a tonometer (Diaton) will identify abnormal brain tissue stiffness in affected brain relative to normal brain. This will help identify stiffer brain regions without having to resect them.

The objective is to determine if intra-operative use of a tonometer to measure brain tissue stiffness will offer additional precision in identifying epileptogenic lesions.

In participants with refractory epilepsy, various locations on the cerebral cortex will be identified using standard pre-operative investigations like magnetic resonance imagin (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). These are areas of presumed normal and abnormal brain where the tonometer will be used during surgery to measure brain tissue stiffness. Brain tissue stiffness measurements will then be compared with results of routine pre-operative and intra-operative tests. Such comparisons will help determine if and to what extent intra-operative brain tissue stiffness measurements correlate with other tests and help identify epileptogenic brain tissue.

24 participants have already undergone intra-operative brain tonometry. Results in these participants are encouraging: abnormally high brain tissue stiffness measurements have consistently been identified and significantly associated with abnormal brain tissue.

If the tonometer adequately identifies epileptogenic brain tissue through brain tissue stiffness measurements, it is possible that resection of identified tissue could lead to better post-operative outcomes, lowering seizure recurrences and neurological deficits."

NCT01928641,"Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV t-PA) is the only proven treatment of hyperacute cerebral infarction. The outcome of this treatment highly depends on the time from symptom onset to the administration of thrombolytic agent. Last known normal time is widely used as the standard to determine the symptom onset. These stroke symptoms are usually caused by a sudden decrease in cerebral blood flow related with an embolic or thrombotic event. However, in some cases various symptoms may occur one after another.

Myocardial infarction is also caused by a sudden caseation of blood flow. The symptom of myocardial infarction usually contains chest pain, and it is easy to identify the exact time of onset. In contrast, cerebral infarction may cause various symptoms according to the infarcted area of the brain, and sometimes multiple symptoms are presented in rapid succession. Therefore, it may be much unclear and uncertain to determine the onset time of cerebral infarction. Despite the importance of onset time in therapeutic decision making, there was no study focusing on the certainty of onset time in cerebral infarction patients.

In this study, we will investigate the subjective certainty of patient about the onset time in clear-onset cerebral ischemia. The discrepancy in diagnosing the onset time will be analyzed among the clinicians involved in the practice. Then, the factors associated with this uncertainty will be verified."

NCT04326205,"Mirror therapy (MT) has been demonstrated, in terms of neuroplasticity, to improve sensorimotor function of paretic upper extremity (UE) in chronic stroke patients. Central and peripheral electrical stimulation techniques such as ranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and functional electrical stimulation (FES) can individually enhance effects of MT, combining both of them with MT can be a potentially valuable approach to maximize neural and functional recovery post stroke. To our knowledge, no studies combined central and peripheral neural network reorganization technique with motor behavioral learning approach to investigate its possible benefit after stroke. This project will be the first to design a ""dual neurotechnology-aided MT (DNA-MT)"", which combines tDCS and FES with contemporary neurorehabilitation approaches (i.e., MT) to stimulate both central and peripheral nervous systems to maximize neural and functional recovery post stroke. Investigators will determine the efficacy and neurophysiological and motor mechanisms related to this novel DNA-MT approach and identify potential responders to this novel intervention."

Ischemic Strokes (clots) occur as a result of an obstruction within a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain. A type of monocyte carrying a surface marker called ""P2X4"" helps the immune system sense and respond to danger signals from the body such as heart muscle and brain tissue injuries.

NCT04318626,"Background and objects： Neuroinflammation is an active process detectable in the earliest stages of the neurodegeneration pathway. On the other hand, significant neuroinflammation, such as reactive astrocytosis, can also be observed after cerebral ischemic injury. [18F]THK5351 can monitor the neuroinflammatory process due to its high affinity to astrogliosis, and [18F]PMPBB3 is the novel tau protein radiotracer without significant off-target binding to MAO-B. The investigators hypothesize that the neuroinflammation after acute stroke may induce the tau protein accumulation. In the current proposal, our aims are to 1) explore the interaction between neuroinflammation and tau protein accumulation in acute stroke patients by applying both the [18F]PMPBB3 and [18F]THK5351 PET images and 2) determine their influence on the longterm stroke outcome and cognitive performance.

Method： The prospective project plans to recruit 2 groups of participants: one is patients with first-ever acute stroke (Group A, n=50), and the other is healthy people as the control group (Group B, n=30). Within 3 weeks of stroke, [18F]THK5351 and [18F]PMPBB3 PET will be done for imaging cerebral neuroinflammation and tau protein distribution. Brain MRI for obtaining structural and functional information will be done within 3 weeks and 3 months after stroke. Clinical and cognitive outcome will be evaluated at week 3 and months 3 and 12. In addition, APOE genotyping and carotid ultrasound will be performed as well. By obtaining the neuroimaging information, such as severity of white matter change and infarction, cortical and hippocampal atrophy, and SUVRs of [18F]THK5351 and [18F]PMPBB3 PET, the study will be able to investigate the complex interaction between neuroinflammation and tau protein accumulation after stroke, and also evaluate their influence on structural changes, stroke outcome and cognitive performance. Group comparisons will be performed using the Chi-square test, independent t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and multiple linear regression, where appropriate.

Anticipation： In this project, the investigators will be able to identify the distribution patterns of neuroinflammation and tau protein accumulation after actue stroke. Secondly, the investigators expect that the presence of neuroinflammation and tau protein accumulation will interfere with the functional connectivity. Finally, the investigators expect that the extent of neuroinflammation and tau protein is correlated with stroke outcome and post-stroke cognitive impairment."

NCT04036084,"CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) is an cerebral microangiopathy secondary to mutations in the NOTCH3 gene located on chromosome 19. This disease is the most frequent of the hereditary vascular leukoencephalopathies.

CADASIL begins between the ages of 20 and 40 with the appearance of hyper-signs of brain white matter visible on T2 sequences in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Before the age of 30, patients are most often asymptomatic. The disease is then responsible for different neurological manifestations:

Migraine attacks with aura occur on average in one in three patients, most often at the beginning of the course of the disease, sometimes even before the appearance of MRI abnormalities;
Transient ischemic strokes or strokes associated with small cerebral infarcts occur most frequently after the age of 50-60 years in more than two out of three patients;
Mood disorders are reported by one in three patients in the same age group;
Cognitive disorders that affect executive functions, especially after the age of 60, until the stage of severe dementia associated with walking disorders are observed during the course of the disease.

To date, there is no treatment whose efficacy has been proven in CADASIL. Various studies have shown that the accumulation of the most destructive brain tissue lesions at the subcortical level was closely correlated in CADASIL with the clinical severity of patients (motor and cognitive disability). It is now possible to measure microstructural changes in brain tissue in diffusion imaging during the course of the disease, even before significant clinical changes are detected."

NCT04275180,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) has the characteristics of high morbidity, high mortality, high disability rate and high recurrence rate. Progressive cerebral infarction (PIS) is a subtype of AIS, accounting for 10% - 40%. Because of the gradual aggravation of neurological deficit symptoms, it has a higher rate of disability and death, which brings heavy mental and economic burden to families, society and the country.

The progress of acute cerebral infarction is generally within 6 hours to 1 week after the onset of the disease. At present, it is considered that thrombus prolongation is one of the important pathogenesis of PIS. Heparin can reduce the incidence of post-stroke embolism, but its benefits are offset by the risk of hemorrhage due to the high risk of hemorrhage. The 2013AHA guidelines in the United States do not recommend it as a routine anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, reducing the risk of bleeding is the key to the anticoagulation therapy of PIS.

Argatroban is a new thrombin inhibitor. Its mechanism of action is to bind and inactivate thrombin (factor Ⅱ a) directly.Compared with traditional anticoagulants, argatroban not only has the advantages of good anticoagulant effect and rapid onset, but also has high safety. Therefore, this study aims to verify the clinical efficacy of Argatroban in the treatment of PIS in a large population.

In this study, 628 patients are expected to be enrolled into the study group. The experimental group and the control group are selected by dynamic random method. Both groups are given standard medical treatment, including routine antiplatelet, blood pressure control, statins to stabilize plaque, etc. The control group is only given standard medical treatment. In the experimental group, Argatroban is used on the basis of standard medical treatment. Both groups are treated for 7 days, and the second-class prevention standard medical treatment is given from the 8th to the 90th day. The main outcome measure is the good prognosis rate at the third month after PIS. The good prognosis was defined as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 3."

NCT01957774,"The purpose of this study is to test the experimental drug ""THR-18"" given together with the drug ""tissue plasminogen activator"" for the treatment of stroke. Tissue plasminogen activator is also called ""tPA"".

Strokes often result from blockade of blood supply caused by blood clots forming within the blood vessel feeding the brain. Such strokes are called ""Ischemic strokes"". Treatment of these strokes is aimed at breaking up the blood clot(s) and renewing the blood flow before further parts of the brain die. Breaking up the blood clot is possible with the drug tPA when it is injected into a vein shortly after the stroke starts. However, along with breaking up the blood clot, tPA sometimes causes adverse effects, for example, it may cause bleeding. THR-18, the drug tested in this study, is meant to bind to tPA and reduce its adverse effects without stopping tPA's breaking up of the blocking blood clot.

The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of THR-18 in acute ischemic stroke patients who are treated in parallel with tPA. Another purpose of this study is to investigate levels of THR-18 and tPA in the blood stream at different time points after they are injected, at the same time, into a vein. In addition, this study will measure tPA's effect on blood clot dissolution when tPA is given with and without THR-18. The study will also study the effect THR-18 may have on signals of brain damage that can be found in the blood after stroke: these signals of brain damage are small proteins called S100B and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9. These proteins are released into the blood stream when the brain is injured.

The safety evaluation of THR-18 in this study will be done in comparison to placebo. Placebo is a drug that looks exactly like THR-18 but has no activity. Three doses of THR-18 will be tested, one after the other, in three groups of patients. In each group, some patients will receive THR-18 and some will receive placebo. This clinical study will be conducted only at one hospital in the Ukraine. In total, 30 patients are planned to participate in this study. These patients will be in the hospital for at least 3 days after receiving the study treatment. Then, about 1 month later, they will be invited for a last follow-up visit."

The investigators hypothesize that hypertensive stroke survivors in the Washington, DC area who participate in the Home Blood Pressure Monitoring program will have a greater reduction in mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to 3 months, as measured by automated office blood pressure (AOBP), as compared to usual care."
NCT04223180,"Stroke is associated with disability and impaired quality of life. Persistent motor impairment is common with incomplete recovery of motor function after rehabilitation, mainly in the upper limbs (UL). Robot-mediated therapy (RMT) has been proposed as a viable approach for the rehabilitation of the UL, but more rigorous studies are needed to tailor rehabilitation and to better address the treatment. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) have been shown to play an important role in post-stroke recovery. After ischemic stroke, disruption and subsequent reorganization of functional brain connections occur both locally and far from the lesion, with the latter possibly contributing to function recovery.

This project aims to assess whether epigenetic and genetic variations of BDNF and SLC6A4 can occur in stroke patients after robotic rehabilitation treatment.

This study will allow to identify potential genetic and epigenetic biomarkers in post-stroke rehabilitation that could be used to predict the response to a specific rehabilitation treatment and to choose the optimal treatment for the patient (Rehabilomics)."
NCT04211662,"Family caregivers are the key persons in the recovery and rehabilitation process of stroke survivors. Despite multiple researches recommended the development of interventions which are based on the family caregivers' needs and recommended the conduction of the interventions based on the integration of skill-building, psychoeducation, and peer support to relieve the care burden they feel, there are no studies conducted to evaluate the effect of such these interventions on the family caregivers of stroke survivors in Egypt. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a tailored multidimensional intervention on the care burden among family caregivers of stroke survivors. Using a randomized control trial, 110 family caregivers will be recruited from the community; from the outpatient clinics and rehabilitation clinics which are located at Mansoura city (Capital of Dakahlia Governorate) and the surrounding cities and villages. The participants will be randomized through 1:1 open-label randomization to the intervention group and the control group. The intervention group will receive the tailored multidimensional intervention. The intervention will last for 6 months. 3 home visits and 3 telephone interventions and 1 peer support will be conducted during the first 3 months. the home visits and telephone interventions will be conducted biweekly alternately. During the second 3 months, 3 telephone follow-ups will be conducted monthly. Regarding the control group, they will receive a simple educational booklet through one home visit. The primary outcome is the care burden (Zarit Burden Interview) and secondary outcomes are the perceived needs (Family Needs Questionnaire-Revised), coping strategies (Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced) and quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF) among family caregivers. The primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed basically before the intervention and after the 3rd and 6th months since the start of the intervention."
NCT04205578,"An extracranial-to-intracranial (EC-IC) revascularization is the most widely used treatment to improve cerebral perfusion in patients with moyamoya disease (MMD), and it has been shown to reduce the risk of subsequent stroke and neurological deficit. However, perioperative changes in cerebral hemodynamics can induce fluctuations in cerebral perfusion that may lead to transient or irreversible neurological deficits. Our preliminary single-center study suggests that postoperative intravenous administration of dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) may alleviate perioperative neurological deficits and improve the neurological outcomes after EC-IC revascularization for MMD. This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, single-controlled, add-on to standard of care study of NBP in patients with MMD of high risk for ischemic cerebrovascular events after EC-IC revascularization surgery."

NCT04203420,"The guideline requires clinical works to screen for primary aldosteronism(PA) in young adults with family history of stroke at early onset. But the prevalence of PA in young adults with stroke onset before 45 years old had never been investigated. The study aimed to discover the prevalence as well as the clinical characteristics between patients with PA and those without PA during stroke attack. In order to fulfill this objective, investigators intended to conduct a cross-sectional study by taking screening and confirmatory tests among young adults who once admitted due to early onset of acute stroke."
NCT04204356,"Aphasia is a language impairment caused by brain injury such as stroke that affects the ability to understand and express language, read and write due to damage in the language regions of the brain. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques like transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) have been found to improve aphasia treatment effects in post stroke patient populations such as improved naming abilities.

However, the effect of tDCS on more functional, higher level language skills such as discourse production (i.e. story telling, giving instructions) has yet to be understood.Therefore the aim of this study is to determine the potential effectiveness of tDCS as an adjunct to speech and language therapy (SLT) to improve discourse speech production in people with post-stroke aphasia. It is hypothesised that SLT combined with tDCS will result in greater improvements in discourse language production compared to SLT on its own."
NCT04196894,"This study focuses on the relationship between obesity and stroke, which are both characterized by increasing incidence and prevalence with epidemic proportions worldwide and tremendous socio-economic consequences. Furthermore, obesity is an established risk factor for stroke and affects especially younger people, which increases the stroke incidence in younger patients. Unfortunately, the relationship between overweight and acute ischemic stroke including treatment by thrombolysis has not yet been evaluated thoroughly."
NCT04197258,"Going back home following a stroke is a key step for the patient and his or her relatives. Due to the brutality of stroke and increasingly shorter in-hospital lengths of stay, patients and their families must adapt quickly to the patient's new health functioning and the new caregiving and support role for family members.

Peer support could be an innovative and inexpensive approach to addressing these issues. Peer-helpers are patient-partners who put their experiential knowledge from life with the disease at the disposal of other patients to offer them social and emotional support in the management of the disease in connection with care, social and community structures. Group peer support programs face organizational challenges and fail to address the full range of patient needs for stroke home visits. Individualized and more flexible support could better meet the needs of patients. Our hypothesis is that individual peer support improves quality of life and patient empowerment during the discharge period compared to usual practice."

NCT04184843,"Stroke remains a major health concern and the second highest cause of disability worldwide. After experiencing a stroke, many people lose the ability to walk independently. As a result, people with stroke require intensive rehabilitation services, spend the majority of their time in physical therapy on retraining walking, and cite recovery of walking as a primary rehabilitation goal. Assessment of walking using reliable and valid tools is a recommended practice in stroke rehabilitation guidelines in Canada, the United States, Australia, and The Netherlands. The 10-metre walk test (10mWT) and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) are highly recommended in guidelines and by professional organizations for the clinical evaluation of walking across the care continuum. For the 10mWT, the time to traverse the middle 10 metres of a 14-metre walkway at a comfortable pace is used to compute comfortable walking speed. For the 6MWT, the maximum distance achieved walking back and forth along a 30-metre walkway in six minutes is documented.

To facilitate physical therapists' (PTs') use of an evidence-informed approach to administering these walking tests post-stroke in an acute care, inpatient rehabilitation, or outpatient rehabilitation setting, the iWalk Toolkit, a theory-based toolkit, was developed. This Toolkit consists of an educational guide, a smartphone app, and an educational video.

In this mixed methods study, PTs across multiple sites were evaluated before and after a 5-month intervention involving the implementation of the iWalk Toolkit. Objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the nature and extent to which PTs across the care continuum uptake/use information in a theory-based toolkit designed to guide use of the 10-metre and 6-minute walk tests post-stroke for initial assessment, goal setting, education, treatment selection and monitoring change; and (2) to describe PTs' perceptions of the features of the guide, the provider and the setting that facilitated or prevented walk test administration and use of test scores for initial assessment, prognosis, goal setting, treatment selection and monitoring change."

NCT04178395,"Objective:

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can change the excitability of the central nervous system and contribute to motor recovery of stroke patients. The investigators hypothesized that the benefit of tDCS may increase with interventions facilitating motor responses, such as repetitive peripheral nerve stimulation (rPNS).

The aim of our study was to examine the short and long-term effects of real vs sham bihemispheric tDCS on scales of motor function and neurophysiological tests in patients with acute stroke and a moderate/severe motor impairment.

Methods:

The study was prospective, randomized, double-blind and placebo controlled. Twenty acute stroke patients (ischemic and haemorrhagic) with Upper limb Fugl-Meyer (ULFM) score<19 were randomized in two parallel groups: one group received 5 consecutive daily sessions of anodal tDCS over the affected hemisphere (AH) and cathodal over unaffected hemisphere combined with rPNS and the other received sham tDCS associated to rPNS. Pacients were examined before tDCS, 5 days and 3, 6 and 12 months after tDCS.

NCT04143880,"A large number of preclinical studies have confirmed that progesterone and its metabolites have strong neuroprotective effects. As a neuroprotective agent, progesterone has been effective in several animal models of nerve injury, suggesting that the drug has a wide range of neuroprotective effects. Pharmacodynamic studies have shown that some characteristic mechanisms of the action of the neurosteroid on brain injury and cerebral congestion include: prevention of inflammatory reaction and cell death (by inhibiting the activation of inflammatory cytokines and microglia); control of angiogenic brain edema (by reestablishing blood-brain barrier and regulating aquaporin-4 water transporter) and cytotoxic edema (by regulating Progesterone can also improve the neural dysfunction after cerebral hemorrhage, promote the regeneration and repair of damaged axons (activate PI3K / Akt pathway to inhibit the expression of RhoA), prevent the loss of Ca2 + caused by excitotoxicity and improve the survival rate of neurons. It was found that progesterone injection could reduce brain edema and promote the recovery of nerve function after brain injury."
NCT04134416,"Post-stroke aphasia (PSA), the partial or total loss of the ability to produce and/or understand language associated with stroke, is a highly prevalent and disabling disorder that negatively impacts the personal, social and working life of patients and families. Modern theory-based language therapies (LT) with proved efficacy in chronic PSA are brief (weeks), intensive, and oriented to specific domains (e.g., anomia). However, in order to maximize therapeutic benefits, it becomes essential to implement complementary strategies that boost gains in language, communication and behaviour and also to identify predictors of treatment response (demographics, anatomical) that enable to customize interventions adjusting them to each profile (linguistic deficits, brain structure and connectivity). Our group has repeatedly shown that LT combined with cognitive enhancing drugs (CED) (e.g., Donepezil and Memantine) are safe and promote better outcomes that when these interventions are administered separately. Moreover, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (NIBS), such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), are also emerging as a promising treatment option for chronic PSA. However, is still unknown whether or not treatments that combine several biological strategies aid to improve outcomes further. Brain changes induced by these interventions and the premorbid characteristic of a ""good responder"" are also unknown. The aims of this clinical trial are: (1) Study the efficacy of combined treatments in a sample of patients with chronic PSA (n = 40); (2) Document with multimodal neuroimaging the functional and connectivity changes (neuroplasticity) promoted by these interventions; and (3) Identify linguistic, cognitive and behavioural variables that may predict outcomes for each intervention."
NCT04124172,"The rehabilitation of the upper limb after a stroke is a challenge due to its complexity and the important cerebral representation of it, particularly of the hand. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a tool that can broaden the effect of rehabilitation and thus appears to be observed in different studies performed in patients in chronic phase. However, there are little data on its usefulness before 6 months after the stroke. The variability in the presentation, the fact that it is a phase where the motor deficit of the upper limb coexists with other deficits and medical problems partly explain the lack of specific studies.

The investigators present here a preliminary study on the efficacy of rTMS associated with the rehabilitation program of the paretic upper extremity due to a stroke in comparison with sham rTMS. Patients (with moderate to mild involvement) will be randomly distributed in the two study groups and will be evaluated both clinically and neurophysiologically before and after the sessions to try to demonstrate if there is a positive effect in a safe manner."
NCT05262699,Interventional study of the effects of vibro-tactile feedback on behavioral deficits and learning during motor training in patients with stroke.
NCT04762940,"The Amadeo® Manual Robotic System (Tyromotion GmbH, Graz, Austria) is designed for rehabilitative treatment of the hand and fingers providing robot-assisted exercise for the finger flexors and extensors. This system has a controlled position, active, active-assisted and passive exercise mode, it also allows isometric exercises with visual feedback provided during computerized games that emphasize flexion and extension. Another of the functions that this device presents and that differentiates it from other handheld robotic systems is its vibration function. Through sensors that are placed on the fingertips, providing a vibratory proprioceptive stimulus of different frequencies.

Currently, there are no published trials on the efficacy of the vibration of this device and its consequent improvement in the sensitivity and functionality of patients with hemiparesis after stroke. Investigations have been conducted in patients with peripheral lesions and in the healthy population. A preliminary study with monkeys demonstrated that the frequency of the vibration presents better results when the muscle stretch receptors are driven by a high frequency vibration, activating the neurons corresponding to the motor cortex and in the 3rd primary sensory area. More recent studies have shown the efficacy of focal vibratory stimulation applied to the wrist and forearm muscles, specifically the application to the tendon of the stimulated muscle.

Regarding the most appropriate form of stimulation, the most important determining factors to highlight are the frequency of application, the duration and intensity and the time of application. The mechanism of action of local muscle vibration is to stimulate various receptors. Meissner corpuscles respond best around 40 Hz, while Vater-Pacini corpuscles around 100 Hz. Together, they are also known as rapidly adapting cutaneous receptors. In contrast, Merkel-Ranvier cells and Ruffini corpuscles are called slow-adapting and classically described as sensitive to sustained pressure. That is why authors of different studies have focused on high frequency vibration of 300 Hz, for 30 minutes. 3 times per week. The duration of vibratory stimulation, different studies show the effects of vibration and changes in the cortex after performing the treatment constantly, for about ten days, intensively three to four days a week, observing long-term changes in terms on cortical excitability."

NCT01912794,"To maintain stable body balance in daily activities, the ability to respond to external perturbations is an essential factor. Such capacity is limited in pathological conditions, such as in stroke, in which postural control is impaired due to lesions to the central nervous system. Impairment to postural control increases body sway during upright posture and leads to augmented frequency of falls. In this sense, the identification of mechanisms involved in body balance disorders after stroke is particularly important in situations of postural perturbation. The purpose of this project is to evaluate reactive postural responses to unpredictable external perturbations, analyzing postural dysfunctions caused by lesion to different brain areas as a result of stroke, and test principles of dynamic body balance rehabilitation."

NCT05603377,"Stroke, main cause of disability in adults, is thought to be the primary cause of swallowing difficulty (dysphagia). Dysphagia is one of the common physical condition among patients with stroke, affecting the large number of stroke patients in the world. It is reported that the occurrence rate of post-stroke dysphagia (PSD) is varies widely, ranging from 19% to 81%, the reason may be associated with the type of stroke, the assessment tools, the timing of the assessment, and so on .Dysphagia is associated with pneumonia, malnutrition, dehydration, increased mortality, and poor long-term outcome. It has been shown that early detection of dysphagia allows for immediate intervention and thereby reduces morbidity, duration of hospitalization, and overall health care costs. Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) can have a high impact on the general health of affected patients and can produce two main types of complications in patients with post stroke: (1) those caused by impaired efficacy of swallow, present in 25%-75% of patients, which leads to malnutrition and dehydration and (2) impaired safety of swallow which leads to tracheobronchial aspiration that may cause pneumonia in 50% of cases. Both OD and aspiration are highly prevalent conditions in patients with stroke . Dysphagia is more common in hemorrhagic stroke compared with ischemic stroke, so far, most studies have focused on the latter, presumably due to its higher incidence .The recognition of a brain lesion pattern associated with oropharyngeal dysphagia could help to distinguish those patients in need of more in-depth evaluation and the subsequent adoption of preventive measures. However, it is difficult to predict which patients are susceptible to developing swallowing alterations depending on neuroimaging findings. However, the findings have been inconsistent, mainly due to simplification in the classification of brain injuries into a small number of groups, or to the different methods employed in assessing swallowing function"

NCT05122286,"Unfavorable outcomes were associated with failed recanalization of acute large vessel occlusions (LVO). The failed recanalization rate of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) was 12-41% reported in multiple randomized controlled trials (RCT). Possible reasons of failed recanalization included technical failure of access, failure of retrieving thrombus, thrombotic re-occlusion, and pre-existing intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS). Several studies have been published on balloon dilation or permanent stenting as rescue approaches for failed thrombectomy in individual cases, but there is no evidence from RCTs regarding this topic. ANGEL-REBOOT aims to close this gap by performing a randomized study of bailout intracranial angioplasty (balloon dilation and/or stenting) for unsuccessful thrombectomy in LVO patients."

NCT01302197,"Stroke, a leading cause of disability in the aging population, increases the risk for diabetes, subsequent stroke recurrence, and cardiovascular disease complications. The downsizing of private and federal health care resources, along with the anticipated increase in stroke rates as our population ages, mandate that alternative strategies be developed to reduce the public health burden of stroke. This pilot study may facilitate our knowledge of the timing of paretic leg muscle atrophy, fiber type shift, and the progression of worsening of glucose tolerance after stroke. Knowledge of the skeletal muscle changes occurring in the sub-acute stroke period is essential to create new guidelines incorporating exercise rehabilitation, much like cardiac rehabilitation, in order to facilitate and improve the health care of veteran stroke survivors."
NCT04099615,"Endovascular treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion does not always lead to good clinical and functional outcome, despite achieving complete arterial recanalization. The rate of significant functional disability or death after three months of an acute ischemic stroke still ranges from 40% to 67%. There is experimental and clinical evidence that somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) are good indicators of cerebral blood flow.

The primary objective of this study is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of N20 response of SEPs prior to mechanical thrombectomy (MT) as a predictor of functional independence at 90 days after endovascular treatment. Secondly, the investigators will study whether SEPs may be neurophysiological markers of brain tissue in ischemic penumbra and optimal collateral circulation.

Bilateral median nerve SEPs will be recorded before and continuously during MT in patients with acute ischemic stroke and anterior large vessel occlusion. N20 response ipsilateral to the cerebral hemisphere affected will be measured (qualitatively and quantitatively). The adjusted predictive value of the N20 biomarker on functional independence after MT will be analyzed by binary logistic regression and its predictive value on the full range of disability by ordinal logistic regression. The investigators will construct different regression models with other clinical predictors available at the prehospital setting and with those determined after hospital admission to determine the independent predictive power of the N20 response for a potential treatment decision-making. Finally, the investigators will study whether SEP can be neurophysiological markers ischemic penumbra tissue and optimal collateral circulation through its correlation with multimodal neuroimaging techniques.

SEPs recording is non-invasive technique that can be performed at the bedside of the patient. The development of a portable device which could allow SEPs recording by sanitary staff (pre- and intrahospitally) would provide early data about N20 value, speeding up streamline decision making."

NCT04099238,"This study will characterize patients with ischemic stroke, a condition which occurs when a vessel supplying blood to the brain is obstructed, and a subpopulation of patients with irregular and often rapid heart rate (atrial fibrillation) in a UK general population using The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database.

The main aim of the study is to estimate in how many patients atrial fibrillation was diagnosed at the moment of stroke and to describe whether these patients received OAC at the time of the stroke. In addition, researchers want to learn about the relative risk of ischemic stroke when such patients did not continue OAC treatment."

NCT03740958,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the most common type of stroke, which has high rate of morbidity, mortality and disability. A large number of studies have confirmed that the thrombolytic therapy can effectively open blood vessels and improve the functional prognosis of acute ischemic stroke. Therefore, all guidelines recommend intravenous thrombolysis as the first treatment of ischemic stroke patients within 4.5 hours of onset. However, about 1/3 patients receiving thrombolysis will have good prognosis, while a large number of patients will still be disabled and even dead. How to improve the neurological prognosis of thrombolytic patients has been a hot topic in the world.

Recent studies have found that the combined application of argatroban and rt-PA in the treatment of AIS might improve the clinical prognosis and not significantly increase bleeding. Some studies have reported that the combined application of argatroban and rt-PA could improve the blood vessel opening rate, and prevent re-occlusion after opening.

Based on the discussion, the present study is designed to explore the efficacy and safety of argatroban plus rt-PA in the treatment of AIS."
NCT04091412,"Intracranial artery stenosis is the leading cause of stroke onset or recurrence in Asian. Multiple studies have shown that anterior circulation is most common in intracranial artery stenosis, especially the middle cerebral artery in patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic ischemic stroke. Based on the clinical experiences, we found that the cerebral collateral development can affect clinical symptoms seriously in patients with large artery stenosis. Compensated blood flow can reach the ischemic area through collateral circulation (including circle of Willis, leptomeningeal collaterals, extracranial to intracranial collaterals, and new angiogenesis) when the blood-supplying artery of the brain is severely stenotic or even occluded, however, considerable differences across individuals exist. Studies have shown statins and butylphthalide can promote collateral circulation. The influencing factors on collateral circulation building have not been completely identified yet, but a recent research found that Naturally occurring variants of Rabep2（Rab GTPase binding effector protein 2）are major determinants of variation in collateral extent and stroke severity in mice. On this basis, clinical trials have been conducted in order to confirm that the Rabep2 gene is associated with individual differences in the collateral circulation.

Summarizing new findings, we suspect whether the difference in the degree of collateral circulation is significant for long-term prognosis in patients with cerebral large arterial occlusion, and whether promoting collateral circulation and new angiogenesis can become a new treatment approach. Hereby, we plan to recruit 500 patients with cerebral large-artery occlusion, collect clinical and Imaging (CTA) information, analyze and investigate if the difference in the degree of collateral circulation can be the independent influencing factor for long-term prognosis. This study will collect blood sample of patients and further examine SNPs of Rabep2, and will then analyze the correlation between Rabep2 and patients with cerebral large-artery occlusion. This project will follow up rolled patients for 1 year, observe if long-term intake of butylphthalide can promote cerebral collateral development."

In addition, to assess the degree of depression experienced by people in this age group who suffer from these diseases. Additional objectives are to investigate important factors that negatively affect the quality of life in this group of patients, according to the international literature, and to highlight targeted interventions to promote mental and physical health in order to improve the quality of life in these chronic patients."
NCT04087382,"Background: intravenous alteplase appears to be much less effective at opening proximal occlusions of the major intracranial arteries, which account for more than one third of cases of acute anterior-circulation stroke and expanding time window using mechanical thrombectomy can improve clinical outcome in patients that would have only received conservative treatment.

The aim of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of endovascular therapy within 24 hours of symptom onset and to compare clinical outcome of endovascular therapy with the standard medical therapy at the end of 3rd month follow up.

Material and Methods 57 subjects presenting with an acute ischemic stroke caused by occlusion of the proximal middle cerebral artery (M1 segment) or Internal carotid artery ( ICA segment) within 24 hours from symptom onset as documented by Ct, and or MRI perfusion were recruited consecutively from 2 University hospitals Ain shams University Hospital (32 Patients) and Aswan University (25 patients).

NCT01396746,"The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between cardiovascular function of persons with post stroke conditions and their performance in three field tests. This is a validation study, aiming to determine during which of two activities VO2 measurements better express the functional restrictions caused by stroke, And to find out whether the Total Heart Beat Index can be used in the case of stroke survivors for the prediction of mechanical efficiency when measured during stair-climbing and of energy cost during treadmill walking.

The hypothesis is that Stair Climbing (STC) is a more suitable form of exercise capacity testing compared to Treadmill Walk (TMW) since it potentially requires a greater amount of external work, and therefore will show stronger correlation with functional tests demonstrating the same ability, whereas TMW does not utilize the movement capability of participants to the fullest.

Another hypothesis is that cardiac response to the exertion can be used as a predictor of those measures during these exertions in the post stroke population."

NCT04066556,"Use of intravenous(IV) thrombolysis and intra-arterial(IA) recanalization treatment has been rapidly increasing, However, despite of the treatment, recanalization rates are 22.6 - 70% and only 30-50% of patients show meaningful clinical improvements. Mechanisms of futile recanalization may include 1) large ischemic core, 2) poor collateral, and 3) presence of comorbidity. In this regards, developing selection criteria using acute stroke imaging and comorbidity is warranted.

The investigators will recruit the consecutive acute stroke patients who received IV thrombolysis and/or IA recanalization treatment. This study will perform with prospective design to develop CT-based clot, core and collateral scores and a comorbidity index for selecting stroke patients who are at high risks by the treatment. The investigators will firstly establish the CT-based scores and comorbidity index using a pre-existing cohort database. Using these CT-based and comorbidity index, the investigators will validate them in a multi-center prospectively cohort."

Patient perceived quality of life

Materials and methods Population: patients from the province of Zaragoza (Spain) diagnosed with a haemorrhagic or ischemic CVA by a neurologist.

Recruitment strategy: recruitment will take place via the Stroke Association in Aragon (AIDA) [Aragon Stroke Association] in the province of Zaragoza, Spain, seeing as the greater proportion of patients who have suffered a stroke and are in the chronic stage of the illness go to this centre to receive treatment. Thus, this avoids patients having to travel elsewhere for the study. Furthermore, in the case of patients who wish to participate in the study after having received information via third persons or via other means and who are not members of the Association or do not attend the centre on a regular basis, the Association AIDA has offered to allow these people to attend for free, making its facilities available and supporting the development of this study."

NCT04043052,"The recent development of acute phase treatments has dramatically improved stroke functional outcome but post-stroke neuropsychiatric disorders, notably post-stroke depression, continue to contribute to the heavy burden of stroke. While these conditions affect about 25% of stroke patients at 3 months, they are under-reported spontaneously by patients and are under-evaluated and treated by clinicians. Other than stroke severity and psychiatric history, risk factors for post-stroke depression remain a matter of debate, thus preventing identification of high-risk patients. Moreover, to date, neither pharmacological nor nonpharmacological treatments have demonstrated a significant benefit in the prevention of this disorder, thereby also impeding the development of early treatment strategies. Yet,the early management of post-stroke depression is critical given its negative influence on long-term functional outcomes, medication adherence, efficient use of rehabilitation services and the risk of stroke recurrence or vascular events. There is a pressing need to develop new tools allowing for the early detection of post-stroke neuropsychiatric complications for each individual patient. The rapid expansion of ambulatory monitoring techniques, such as Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), allows daily evaluations of mood symptoms in real time and in the natural contexts of daily life. The investigators have previously validated the feasibility and validity of EMA to assess daily life emotional symptoms after stroke, demonstrating its utility to investigate their evolution during the 3 months following stroke and to identify early predictors of post-stroke depression such as stress reactivity and social support, suggesting that EMA could be used in the early personalized care management of these neuropsychiatric complications. Recently, preliminary data have also emphasized the potential of EMA interventions to improve the outcome of psychiatric disorders."

NCT04038424,"Stroke can affect the physical, emotional and social aspects of the patient and their family members. It is the main cause of complex disability, with a high number of people living with its effects. Stroke can result in impairments in motor function, language, cognition, sensory processing, cognition, and emotional disturbances, which can affect the performance of functional activities and mental health status. Getting patients involved in art therapy (AT) class has shown to alleviate stress and promote a sense of wellbeing, which can aid their recovery and rehabilitation. The benefits of art therapy for people living with different health conditions worldwide have been reported, however, its effect on Egyptian patients with stroke has been neglected."
NCT04036422,"Stroke occurs as a result of blood vessels of the brain becoming blocked or bleeding which in turn can result in loss of function in the limbs. Rehabilitation of patients following stroke includes repetitive, task based exercises to help regain normal limb function. Developments in stroke rehabilitation have resulted in more and more therapeutic options being available for inclusion in the treatment plan of stroke patients. The benefits of computerised task based arm and hand rehabilitation exercises in stroke rehabilitation are well known. Computer based rehabilitation supports the stroke patient in performing high intensity, multiple repetition exercises and in doing so encourages the regeneration of brain cells. In addition, it is believed that the stimulating environment provided by computerised exercise programs encourages the ability to problem solve and perform tasks. However, the effects of such computer based treatments on cognition have rarely been studied.

In Turkey to date there are no community based, task specific computerised exercise programmes available to stroke sufferers. Such systems may provide inpatient and community based stroke sufferers with a practical and economical therapeutic option as a part of stroke rehabilitation. Moreover, this may provide the patient with a mode of ongoing, long term therapeutic exercise and maintenance of skills acquired in the hospital rehabilitation period shortly after stroke.

The aim of this study was to investigate the benefits of computer based, task specific exercises when compared to conventional rehabilitation alone on arm and hand function, quality of life and cognition in stroke patients."

NCT04035681,"The purpose of this feasibility study is to determine whether it is practical and helpful to provide problem-solving therapy to stroke survivors and their spouses/partners (caregivers) together. It will also compare the experiences of participants who receive problem-solving therapy to those who receive stroke-related health education.

Many stroke survivors and caregivers report feeling sad or blue at some point after the stroke. These feelings can impact quality of life. Encountering problems is a part of daily life. These problems can be big or small, but sometimes they can pile up and feel overwhelming, contributing to feelings of sadness. Problem-solving therapy is a tool that teaches structured ways to address current problems or challenges in your life.

Participants who are assigned to receive problem-solving therapy will work with a research team member for six, one-hour sessions. During each session, participants will identify a problem (big or small) and create a plan to work on that problem.

Participants who are assigned to receive stroke-related health education will work with a research team member who will teach them about various topics related to stroke over six, one-hour sessions. Each session will cover information about a different topic related to stroke.

Outcomes data will be collected at approximately 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 13 weeks from baseline."
NCT04035746,"Reperfusion is the main goal of early medical interventions after stroke, such as thrombolysis and thrombectomy. Recanalization works only if applied early - the earlier the better, but with a statistical cutoff of 4.5 hours where risk of hemorrhage outweighs the benefit. Recently, this cutoff has been put into perspective using standardized perfusion measurements by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). Two trials have shown that revascularization is beneficial up to 24 hours after stroke onset if patient selection is based on perfusion imaging. This suggests interindividual differences in the temporal evolution of an infarction. One explanation for interindividual differences is the variability of the collateral blood supply to the brain, which in turn can maintain different perfusion pressures around the infarct core, also called the penumbra region. Insufficient recruitment of these collateral pathways is an independent negative predictor of poor outcome; the insufficiency may in part be explained by insufficient dilatation of arterioles (""low dilator reserve""). So far, interventions to improve collateral perfusion, e.g., induced hypertension, have not demonstrated effectiveness, likely because our understanding of collateral perfusion, demand-dependent dilatation of arteries (cerebrovascular reserve, CVR) and their effect on microcirculation is insufficient.

Functional recovery after a brain lesion is based on plasticity. Plasticity involves the creation of new synapses, fibers (axons and dendrites) and lasting modification to synaptic strength as well as the formation and migration of new neurons. In the cortex surrounding an infarct, plasticity is facilitated by ischemia via modification of gene expression, i.e. a certain time window after stroke, and is stimulated by activity and training. Tissue microcirculatory status and perfusion surrounding the stroke lesion may play a role in the formation of this plasticity. The investigators will analyze the contributions of pre-existing vascular networks, the impact of stroke-affected vessels, timing and degree of recanalization success, brain excitability, and short-term intra-cortical inhibition to better understand how these factors relate to functional recovery after stroke."

NCT05579405,"Any platelet function tests have not been widely used in the clinical practice of acute cerebrovascular disease because of the concerns in repeatability, economic performance, and simplicity. Soluble C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (sCLEC-2) is a new marker for platelet activation, which can be easily measured by usual blood collection in routine clinical practice. We planned the sCLEC-2 in Stroke (CLECSTRO), which is a prospective cohort study in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and transient ischemic attack (TIA). We planned the sCLEC-2 in Stroke (CLECSTRO), which is a prospective cohort study in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and transient ischemic attack (TIA).

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical utility of sCLEC-2 as a biomarker for pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, prediction of prognosis, and monitoring of antiplatelet therapy in patients with AIS and TIA. Subjects are patients with AIS or TIA and control patients required for differentiation from AIS or TIA. The target population is 600 including the patients and the controls. The outcomes include difference in plasma sCLEC-2 level between patients with AIS or TIA and patient controls, correlation between sCLEC-2 after antithrombotic therapy and recurrence or worsening of stroke, difference in sCLEC-2/D-dimer ratio between non-cardioembolic and cardioembolic AIS or TIA, and correlation between baseline sCLEC-2 and outcome (modified Rankin scale score) after 3 months. sCLEC-2 could be a widely useful biomarker to contribute to the progress of precision medicine in clinical practice of AIS and TIA."
NCT04757467,"Stroke is a very serious medical condition, classically categorized as a neurological disorder that occurs due to obstructed blood flow to specific parts of the brain, and resultant death of that area.This obstructed blood supply results in compromised function of that part of the brain, resulting in paralysis or interference with the normal function of the body controlled by that specific region of the brain. Stroke is usually of two types i.e. Ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke results in reduced or complete obstruction in blood flow in the vessels resulting in ischemia, while a hemorrhagic stroke occurs due to rupture of blood carrying vessels and results in clotting. CIMT has proven effective in rehabilitation of motor functions of lower limbs in many pieces of evidence but still, the evidence is less as compared to the upper extremity. Evidence about improvement in balance and gait using CIMT is very little. In some studies, hours of daily practice for the task has used as a total therapeutic dose measurement. While, in other studies, repetitions of the task have used to calculate the total amount of therapeutic intervention. This study will evaluate the effects of frequency and duration of the task in CIMT on motor functions, gait & balance of lower limb stroke patients by intervention using these two protocols of CIMT."

NCT03978988,"Tandem occlusion is defined by an acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with concomitant steno-occlusive disease of the extra cranial carotid artery and concerned about 10% of AIS patients. Whereas endovascular treatment has shown its efficiency in AIS by large vessel occlusion (LVO), to date, there is no consensus on the endovascular management of the extra cranial carotid artery in tandem occlusion. Only few of them were included in previous randomized trials who evaluated mechanical thrombectomy and were often listed in the non-inclusion criteria. Therapeutic management of this population was not specifically addressed in recent trials. Endovascular management can be complex with the need of acute stenting of the extra cranial carotid lesion along with the potential need of antithrombotic therapy initiation, the benefit and the safety of stenting of the cervical lesion in acute phase of AIS have shown encouraging results but however remains to be assessed. The TITAN (Thrombectomy In TANdem lesion) trial aims to demonstrate the superiority of the combined use of intracranial thrombectomy and extracranial carotid stenting compared to intracranial thrombectomy alone on the complete reperfusion rate in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to tandem lesion."

NCT03968068,"The first week after a stroke is a particularly important time, as improving blood flow may limit secondary ischaemic damage to the brain and help reduce the overall burden neurological injury and future disability.

Small studies in patients with stroke have shown that moderate aerobic exercise increases blood flow to the brain, however, no studies have evaluated the safety of aerobic exercise within the first week after stroke, nor whether it results in changes to cerebral blood flow.

Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is when ischaemia is induced to a limb for short periods of time by inflating pressure cuffs around arms or legs to above systolic pressures (mmHg). This procedure is performed for periods that avoid physical injury to the limbs, but induce neurohormonal, systemic or vascular changes in the body. These changes often result in improved blood supply to various areas of the body. The use of RIC in the acute period after stroke is currently being investigated in a number of large randomised controlled trials e.g. RECAST, RESIST, however, our understanding of how RIC actually works is incomplete. Importantly, there is scarce data on the acute effects of RIC on cerebral blood flow (CBF), a potentially pivotal mechanism behind its effects.

We propose an exploratory study to evaluate whether it is feasible, acceptable and safe to undertake low and moderate intensity aerobic exercise or remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) in patients during the acute period after stroke, and whether either of these interventions result in changes to cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) in the major cerebral arteries. We will compare any changes to those in a cohort of healthy volunteers."

The low ABI is a strong marker of generalized atherosclerosis. LEAD is a strong independent predictor for stroke."
NCT03961334,"The present trial is addressing the question if a biologically distinct subgroup of ischemic stroke patients without known atrial fibrillation at admission, selected by a cut-off level of MRproANP concentration, which represents a underlying increased risk of cardiac thrombogenicity, benefits from direct oral anticoagulation (DOAC) versus antiplatelets as preventive treatment."
NCT03960918,"Background: Stroke is a cerebrovascular disease which leads to ischemic damage of brain tissue and subsequent neurologic impairment. Aerobic capacity has become an effective prognosis for overall and cardiovascular mortality, but current protocols using in cardiopulmonary test (CPET) are not feasible for the hemiplegics due to balance or coordination deficit. The peak oxygen uptake should be underestimated for survival prediction. The calculation of the oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) is independent of incremental exercise protocol, and patient effort, and is, therefore, suitable for patients who are not able or willing to attain maximal exercise values, just like stroke population.

Study Purpose: This project will enroll stroke patients to evaluate their aerobic capacity by CPET. Compared retrospectively with previous data from heart failure patients and healthy subjects, the investigators may know the aerobic capacity of stroke patients is underestimated or not. By collecting other parameters from exercise test (cardiac output and local tissue perfusion and oxygenation), the investigators could investigate the exercise intolerance of stroke patients is contributed from neurological origin mainly or several factors synergically."

NCT03945851,"The purpose of performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans on patients undergoing stroke rehabilitation therapy in conjunction with vagal nerve stimulators (VNS) is to determine if the patients clinical improvement correlates to changes that can be identified on MRI of the brain such as degree of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, changes in resting state connectivity, and corticospinal tract fiber density.

Subjects will be randomized at implant surgery to either the device treatment (rehabilitation and VNS) or control (rehabilitation and Control VNS) groups. All participants of this study are also participants of the STU 062017-071 study and chose to participate in this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sub-study. Rehabilitation is standard of care.

Both experimental groups and control groups will receive pre-rehabilitation and post-rehabilitation fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans to quantify their white matter track density. We will analyze this data using the University of Texas Southwestern (UTSW) Advanced Neuroscience Imaging Research (ANSIR) pipeline which can automatically quantify white matter track density on both sides of the brain given the appropriate scans. In this study the VNS device specifically will not be studied. Rather we will be looking at the changes that occur in the brain as a result of using the VNS device during physical rehabilitation.

Once the post-rehabilitation scans are completed the patients in the control group will be given the opportunity to crossover into the experimental group and receive physical rehabilitation with the VNS implant turned on. They will have a third MRI session after their round of rehabilitation with the implant turned on in order to quantify their white matter tract density."

NCT03946488,"Stroke is the leading cause of disability in adults. The improvement of the grasp abilities remains a challenge in the 50% of post-stroke subjects who have not recovered functional grasping due to paralysis of the finger's muscles (lack of active opening of the hand).

The use of functional electrical stimulation of the prehension muscles in order to restore grasp abilities, called grasp neuroprosthesis (GP), remained confidential in post-stroke subjects while their development was important in tetraplegic subjects. GP can provide a correct hand opening with significant functional gain, but one of the major issues corresponds to the control modalities that are not adapted to the specific impairments of post-stroke subjects.

This project proposes to assess the functional contribution of an innovative autopilot closed-loop GP targeting the extensor muscles of the fingers. The main hypothesis is that the use of GP will restore grasping abilities in subjects who have lost this ability due to post-stroke paralysis.

The main objective is to assess the impact of using an autopilot closed-loop GP on the ability to perform a standardized task of grasping, moving and releasing either a glass (palmar grasp) or a spoon (key pinch), compared to the absence of GP use.

The secondary objectives of the study are: (1) to assess the impact of the GP on unimanual grasp; (2) to assess which are the preferential modes of control; (3) to assess the psycho-social impacts of GP, and (4) to assess the subject's satisfaction and tolerance to the characteristics and use of GP.

The investigators plan to include 20 post-stroke hemiplegic subjects over a period of 9 months as part of a prospective, monocentric, multi-crossover, blinded evaluation study. Subjects will have active finger extension deficit secondary to stroke, with preservation of proximal movements. Each subject will be his own control (self-pairing).

Each subject will be evaluated three times, the protocol adding approximately 1½ hours of daily assessment to routine care already received. The first visit will collect clinical data after informed consent collection. The second visit will allow to choose the optimal mode of control of the GP among 8 modalities. The third visit will test the functional gain provided by the use of GP, by comparing the success or failure of carrying out functional tasks with inactive and active GP."

NCT03939624,"The purpose of this study is to compare the risk of cardiovascular events associated with the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in comparison with the use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors among patients with type 2 diabetes.

The investigators will carry out separate population-based cohort studies using health care databases in seven Canadian provinces and the United Kingdom. The study cohort will be defined by the initiation of a SGLT2 inhibitor or a DPP-4 inhibitor after SGLT2 inhibitors entered the market. Patients will be followed up until the occurrence of a cardiovascular event. The results from the separate sites will be combined by meta-analysis to provide an overall assessment of the risk of cardiovascular events in users of SGLT2 inhibitors.

NCT02165644,"Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) can occur commonly in the setting of trauma or brain aneurysm. SAH accounts for 10% of all the strokes. Aneurysmal SAH accounts for 80 % of cases of non-traumatic cases of SAH, 6-8% of all strokes and 22-25% of all cerebrovascular deaths. Mortality can be 50% in the first few years of aneurysmal SAH rupture, 15% are severely disabled post SAH and only 20-35% having a moderate to good recovery it has gained lot of attention and pre-clinical and clinical trials of various agents have been tried to prevent poor outcome. The United States epidemiology data reveals the fact that 1% to 5% of adults have unruptured brain aneurysm and 30,000 people suffer from aneurysm rupture annually translating to brain aneurysm rupture every 18 minutes.

Vasospasm is the most common SAH complication post 24 hours. It is the segmental or diffuse narrowing of the vessels especially the large vessels. Fifty percent of those patients who develop clinical vasospasm, progress to infarction and 15-20% will advance to disabling stroke or die of cerebral ischemia. The present treatment modalities are insufficient to prevent vasospasm. So, we need new treatment modalities to decrease the mortality and morbidity in SAH patients.

The investigators hypothesize that Acetazolamide administration can prevent development of vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH."

NCT04764994,"Stroke is the third commonest cause of death and is probably the commonest cause of severe disability. Upper limb recovery after stroke is unacceptably poor with only 50% of stroke survivors likely to regain some functional use. In many disabilities, the rehabilitation process is of long duration and clinicians face the challenge of identifying a variety of meaningful and motivating intervention tasks that may be adapted and graded to facilitate this process.. Motor learning models emphasize that self-generated voluntary actions should be used and repeated in playful and motivational settings and that the difficulties of the task have to be at an appropriate level for successful learning. Motivation to use the hemiplegic upper extremity was considered to be the most important factor in guaranteeing intense practice and was achieved through the patient's individual inner drive and motivation for play. Virtual reality-based therapy is one of the most innovative and developments in rehabilitation technology. Enhanced feedback provided by a virtual reality system has been shown to promote motor learning in normal subjects. Interaction with objects in a virtual environment (VE) through grasping and manipulation is an important feature of future virtual reality simulations. Until now, there has been limited research involving the inclusion of virtual reality gaming systems in neuro-rehabilitation for hemiplegic patients. So the purpose of this study will be evaluation of the efficacy of virtual reality technology on improving the function of the involved upper extremity in Saudi patients having stroke."

NCT05128461,"Stroke, according to the definition of the World Health Organization (WHO); It is a syndrome characterized by a rapid settlement of signs and symptoms of focal loss of cerebral function without a cause other than vascular causes. As it is known, it is important for patients to regain functional skills in the upper extremities after stroke. Modified-Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (m-CIMT) is a versatile neurorehabilitation technique that aims to improve motor function in the hemiparetic upper extremity and increase its use in daily life activities. However, as in the Covid-19 pandemic, patients cannot always reach rehabilitation services. In such cases, telerehabilitation is a treatment option. There are a limited number of studies in which m-CIMT is applied according to the principle of telerehabilitation, which has become a necessity, especially due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the effects of m-CIMT on upper extremity motor functions in stroke patients."

NCT03825679,"Cerebral infarction is a major health problem. The two most common causes are atherosclerosis (30 to 35%) and cardio-embolic origin (35 to 40%). However, in 25% of cases the cause is undetermined, known as cryptogenic stroke or stroke of undetermined origin. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation appears to cause a significant proportion of these cryptogenic cerebral infarctions. One of the major challenges in the management of cerebral infarctions is the prevention of recurrence. If the cause is atheromatous, treatment is based on platelet antiaggregants and the correction of cardiovascular risk factors. If the cause is atrial fibrillation, the treatment of choice is anticoagulation therapy. Cryptogenic strokes are managed with antiplatelet therapy. In past studies, the thrombi responsible for cerebral infarctions have been analyzed anatomopathologically to see if the composition of the thrombi could help identify the cause of the cerebral infarction. These studies have proved to be contradictory. The composition of the bacterial flora of cerebral infarct thrombi has not yet been studied, apart from some limited data on septic emboli. In myocardial infarction, the cause of which is almost exclusively atheromatous, bacteria of the periodontal flora have been detected in thrombi of ST-segment elevation infarctions. The causes of cerebral infarction are multiple. The hypotheses explored in this study are that there are differences in the composition of the bacterial flora of the thrombus depending on whether the cause is atheromatous or cardio-embolic and that the study of the composition of the thrombus could be used to identify the cardio-embolic cause in patients with cryptogenic cerebral infarction."

NCT05187975,"Post-stroke depression (PSD) is a common complication of stroke that leads to dysfunction and reduces the quality of life. PSD exacerbates cognitive dysfunction, delays the recovery process, and increases the disability, mortality and recurrence rates of stroke. Therefore, early clinical treatments for PSD are important to improve the prognosis and restore the social functions of stroke patients.

Integrated rehabilitation has significant advantages in the treatment of PSD. First of all, there is a wide range of rehabilitation methods, such as acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, which have been proved to be effective for PSD. However, as the application of integrated rehabilitation becomes more and more widespread, its shortcomings are gradually emerging. For example, most of the treatment protocols used in clinical studies are based on personal experience of the investigators, a unified protocol has not yet been formed; treatment methods are still insufficient in standardization and reproducibility. More studies focus solely on the improvement of a certain symptom by a certain rehabilitation therapy, but ignore the important theoretical basis of the ""holistic concept"", thus showing the uneven clinical efficacy. For the above existing problems, it is necessary to conduct original and innovative research."

NCT02907736,"Acute Ischemic stroke (AIS) remains a leading cause of adult disability, cognitive impairment and mortality worldwide despite the development of revascularization therapies (intravenous Tissue Plasminogen Activator (t-PA) and endovascular therapy). Thrombosis resistance after IV t-PA therapy is frequent especially in case of AIS with proximal occlusion. In recent years, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been identified as major triggers and structural factors of various forms of thrombosis. NETs are extracellular webs primarily composed of DNA from neutrophils. A recent study shows that the NETs burden in coronary thrombi is positively correlated with the infarct size and negatively correlated with electrocardiogram (ST-segment) resolution. This later study revealed that in vitro addition of DNase I accelerated the t-PA-induced thrombolysis of coronary thrombi. NETs could, in consequence, be promising targets for improved thrombolysis in AIS.

NCT05244850,"Cerebrovascular accident is the third leading cause of death in developed countries after heart disease and cancer. In adults, it ranks first among neurological diseases in terms of causing death and disability. About one-third of stroke patients experience permanent physical dysfunction. This situation has a negative impact on the economic, social, psychological life and general quality of life of the patient and his family. Stroke is one of the leading causes of long-term disability in adults due to problems such as activity limitations and participation restrictions caused by disorders in body functions. Movement disorder is one of the most common symptoms of stroke, and people with stroke often have trouble falling while walking after they are discharged from the hospital. Therefore, one of the main goals of stroke rehabilitation is to regain independent mobility with a safe and stable gait pattern. In addition to all these, one of the problems faced by most stroke patients is sensory-perception disorders. Sensory impairment can be experienced as the inability to perceive the senses or the inability to distinguish the senses. It should be considered that sensory awareness decreases as more than one sensory impulse competes with each other at the same time, and this situation should not be ignored during the evaluation. Although motor movement is governed by the normal motor field, the adjustment of our position in space is entirely the task of the sensory field. It is not possible to initiate and coordinate movement without sensory control. Since environmental change cannot be perceived during movement, it is not possible to provide environmental adaptation."

In this randomised clinical trial, the investigators aim to evaluate whether use of 0-degree HOB positioning is associated with clinical stability in hyperacute IS. Investigators hypothesise that patients with large artery occlusions placed in a 0-degree HOB position will experience less early neurologic deterioration within the first 24 hours, than those in the 30-degree or more HOB elevation group. The study aims to confirm the safety of 0-degree-HOB positioning in a large, generalizable sample of hyperacute large artery IS patients. In this randomised trial, patients presenting to the study centers and eligible for intravenous thrombolysis, with (if presenting within 4.5 hours of symptom-onset) or without (presenting between 4.5 to 16 hours of symptom-onset) mechanical thrombectomy. Eligible patients would be randomised to either a zero-degree HOB or an HOB of 30-degree or more. Impact of HOB position on neurological status would be evaluated with serial NIHSS scores. Cerebral hemodynamics would be monitored by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. Validated criteria would be used to diagnose pneumonia. Functional outcome would be measured by modified Rankin scale (mRS) where the score of 0-2 describe good functional recovery. SPSS version 20 would be used to analyse the data. The trial would provide clinical and hemodynamic data to determine the optimal HOB position in patients with large artery acute ischemic stroke."

NCT04721561,"After a stroke, more than two out of three patients experience problems with upper limb movement and sensation. During the past decade, robotic technology has been increasingly used to asses these problems in a detailed and accurate manner. However, sensory processing, one of the most important sensory functions, has not been assessed using robotic technology yet. Therefore, the investigators have developed a robotic assessment of sensory processing. During this study, the investigators aim to initially validate this novel assessment. The investigators aim to examine 20 chronic stroke patients and 20 age-matched healthy controls using the robotic assessment on one hand, and a set of existing clinical assessments on the other hand. The investigators hypothesize that stroke patients will have a poorer performance on this novel robotic assessment compared to age-matched healthy controls, and that these findings are similar to what is found with existing clinical assessments."

NCT03584425,"In healthy individuals, unimanual movement (with either the left or right hand) is associated with activity in a network of predominantly contralateral brain regions, including the primary motor cortex (PMC). This laterality is often compromised following a middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. Neuroimaging studies of these patients have shown that unimanual movements with the effected hand are associated with elevated Blood Oxygen-Level Dependent (BOLD) signal in both the lesioned and the nonlesioned primary motor cortices. Elevated activity in the contralesional PMC is well-established in chronic stroke patients and is associated with poor motor rehabilitation outcomes. Yet the neurobiologic basis for this aberrant neural activity is equivocal. The overarching goal of this project is to determine the neurobiologic basis for elevated activity in the contralesional primary motor cortex."

NCT01304017,"In Israel approximately 16,000 people have a stroke each year. Most of these people suffer from weakness or paralysis of half of their body which leads to difficulties performing basic activities of daily life (BADL) such as dressing and walking. Due to the stroke, these individuals need to undergo intensive rehabilitation. After rehabilitation, physical activity has been strongly recommended to maintain their functional level which was achieved during rehabilitation. In addition regular physical activity can prevent secondary condition However, recent findings suggest that people with stroke do not perform enough physical activity with their upper and lower extremities.

The use of Virtual Reality (VR) for rehabilitation has been found to have potential for encouraging active purposeful movement. Many researchers have assessed the feasibility & usability of different VR systems and environments for individuals with stroke. Costly VR systems in addition to off-the-shelf video game consoles (e.g. Sony PlayStation EyeToy, Nintendo Wii) have been found to have great potential to encourage active purposeful movement. However, to date, only a limited number of studies have investigated the effectiveness of VR therapy post-stroke.

Since physical activity is important after stroke and the fact that individuals with stroke are not participating sufficiently in physical activity, I suggest to carry out this study.

The overall aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of using novel technology of VR therapy to promote the participation in daily physical activity of individuals with stroke. A 'Community based' VR program will be compared to a traditional therapy program in promoting daily physical activity of the lower and upper extremities.

It is hypothesized that the VR intervention will be more efficient than the traditional therapy in promoting physical activity (walking and use of the weak upper extremity)."

NCT03524742,"Recent global burden of disease analysis of DALYs, showed that dietary risk have the highest DALYs in ischemic stroke among behavioral risk factors. The MediDiet is associated with a decreased risk of total mortality as well as stroke incidence and mortality. Although not part of the classical Mediterranean diet they are another nutrient-dense source of MUFA, rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, phytosterols and polyphenols extensively consumed in the Americas. Avocado-substituted diets significantly decrease cholesterol levels in diabetic and obese patients. Secondary stroke prevention studies with diet as an intervention are lacking and there is little information of what patients eat before or after an ischemic stroke.

NCT05601934,"Hemiplegia is a disease with many complications in its clinical course. One of these complications is respiratory dysfunction. It is aimed to determine the respiratory function problems of patients with hemiplegia and to eliminate the problems by using neurophysiological facilitation techniques.

Restrictive and obstructive pulmonary dysfunction occurs in hemiplegic patients. Decreased movement in the thorax, decreased respiratory muscle strength, changes in muscle tone, and changes in the central nervous system cause restrictive respiratory disorders. A significant decrease is observed in FEV1(Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second), FEV1%, FVC(Forced Vital Capacity), FVC% values.

Alveolar ventilation is maintained through the central nervous system. For alveolar ventilation, the brain must transmit the impulse of breathing to the muscles through the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. Lesions occurring in any part of the central nervous system affect respiratory functions.

Hemiplegia is a condition that affects the movement of the diaphragm. During quiet breathing, there is a significant decrease in the movement of the diaphragm. Chest expansion is reduced.

In a study, it was reported that neuromuscular facilitation techniques increase short-term ventilation and are reliable techniques for people with neurological damage.

NCT04576598,"Stroke is the third leading cause of disability worldwide. Women present a higher incidence of this pathology and prevalence of its risk factors. Similarly, after stroke, women have a poorer functional outcome, higher rates of institutionalization and greater dependence on activities of daily living. People who have suffered a stroke are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, with an estimated one-third of stroke survivors suffering a new event in the following 5 years. Current scientific literature recommends the promotion of physical activity (PA) and exercise for the prevention of stroke and its sequelae. However, stroke survivors are often insufficiently active. Therefore, changing their behavior with respect to PA and sedentary lifestyle is fundamental. Moreover, gender perspective, should also taken into account.

Thus, our aims are to study whether there are differences in women with chronic stroke sequelae compared to men in: 1) the amount of sitting time and its context, as well as the time spent in different intensities of PA; 2) the reduction of sitting time and its effect on health after the completion of the PA self-management program and sedentary lifestyle developed in this project; 3) the presence of sarcopenia, osteoporosis and the state of frailty.

To achieve these objectives, the lifestyle habits of 128 subjects (64 women) who live in the community and have chronic sequelae of stroke (≥ 6 months) will be evaluated. In addition, possible differences in the study variables will be verified with control people without sequelae of stroke. Moreover, in order to reduce the risks of stroke survivors, a program of self-management of PA and sedentary lifestyle will be developed. This program will be carried out through several sessions spread over six months that will incorporate: education, goal setting, identification of barriers, self-control and feedback. The feasibility of this intervention will be determined by examining compliance, duration, utility, and safety. At least 64 of the previously studied subjects will participate in this program, analyzing whether it favors the reduction of sitting time and its effect on health thanks to the measurement of different physical capacities. The differences between men and women in response to the program will be determined.

NCT04572477,"Amyloid plaques and tau protein are the landmarks of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). On the other hand, it is reported that cerebral ischemia may induce amyloid plaques and tau protein accumulation. However, it was difficult to in vivo disentangle the complex and dynamic interactions between AD pathophysiology and cerebral vascular injury in the development of post-stroke cognitive impairment in the past. With the advent of novel radiotracers specific to cerebral amyloid plaques and tau protein, we aim to conduct a prospective multimodal neuroimaging cohort study to investigate the contribution of vascular injury, amyloid plaques and tau protein to stroke recovery and post-stroke cognitive impairment."

NCT03484351,"Between 45-73% of people who have had a stroke fall over in the months and years following their stroke. Falls not only lead to injuries such as broken hips, but they may also lead to fear of falling. As a consequence people can get fearful to walk, keep up their household tasks and their social activities such as visiting friends and family.

Research has shown that exercises for strength and balance can help both older people and patients after stroke to get fitter and healthier and help to prevent them from having a fall. People also have less falls if they have learned about falls facts and home safety precautions. Research has further suggested that people have less fear of falling and less injuries from a fall if they have learned how to fall ('safe landing' strategies). Based on these research findings the researchers have developed a new falls prevention programme called the Fall Monty Activity Programme (FallMAP). This programme aims to aid in functional recovery and reduce falls by combining a mix of activities such as falls education, strength and balance exercises, and activities that teach people how to get up from the floor and how to fall safely.

Especially because people with residual impairments following a stroke have an increased risk of a fall, the feasibility of this programme will be tested in a small group of people after stroke first. This study is a first step in establishing whether the different components of the FallMAP are acceptable and practical for both patients after stroke and staff who deliver the program. In particular, it is important to evaluate if it is feasible to provide the seven combined components as one comprehensive programme. Secondly, the question whether participating in the programme can positively influence the participants' fear of falling, quality of life, leg strength, balance and mobility will be explored. If this feasibility study suggests the programme can work in the clinical setting, then a definitive randomised controlled trial will be proposed in order to look at whether the full programme is effective at reducing falls in patients after stroke."
NCT01949948,"BACKGROUND: Alteplase dissolves blood vessel clots in acute ischemic stroke and is the only approved acute drug treatment <4½ hours of stroke onset. The overall benefit from alteplase is substantial, but up to 2/3 of patients with large artery clots may not achieve reopening of the vessel and up to 40% of the patients may remain severely disabled or die, leaving substantial room for improvement. Tenecteplase, widely used in coronary heart disease, may be more effective and may have less bleeding complications than alteplase, and may be the drug of choice also in stroke.

HYPOTHESIS: Tenecteplase may be given safely to patients with acute ischemic stroke at a dose that is associated with improved clinical outcome compared with existing treatment options.

AIMS: To compare efficacy and safety of tenecteplase vs. alteplase given <4½ hours after symptom onset.

STUDY ENDPOINTS: The primary study endpoint is excellent clinical outcome at 3 months (effect). Secondary study endpoints are major early clinical improvement (effect) and bleeding complications (safety)."
NCT03205527,"The long-term objective of this research is to develop an efficacious training paradigm to enhance stroke survivors' defense mechanisms against falls and possibly reduce healthcare cost. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the direct medical cost for fall related injuries to be $34 billion annually. Forty percent to 70% of community-dwelling stroke survivors experience detrimental falls each year and tend to have 1.5 to 4 times higher risk of hip fracture than their healthy counterparts; with only less than 40% of those individuals regaining independent mobility. Falls, thus not only affect activities of daily living but also reduce mobility, increase risk of second stroke and mortality. Despite potential financial and functional implications of falls in this population, health-care personnel are limited in their ability to develop and validate interventions to reduce fall-risk for them. Further emphasis is placed on locomotor training with focus on enhancing paretic limb function. The project design consists of a randomized controlled trial to examine the ability of chronic stroke survivors to acquire, generalize and retain adaptations to slip-perturbation training for not only mitigating fall risk but also improving walking function. It also explores translation of this paradigm to the sub-acute population. The paradigm is novel in that it targets contributions of the paretic vs. non-paretic limbs on fall-risk through a bilateral training paradigm that involves training the non-paretic side first and then paretic to facilitate acquisition of fall-prevention skills on the paretic side, which may otherwise take longer to acquire training effects. The longer-term benefits of such perturbation training, targeting both limbs for reducing falls will be assessed not only in the laboratory but also in real life via wearable sensors, along with improved community walking function. The hypothesis of this study if supported by the results will provide an evidence-supported training protocol to reduce the fall-risk not only in people living with hemiparetic stroke but also among survivors of other acquired unilateral cortical lesions."
NCT03529305,"In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate functional and structural improvements in the brain of stroke patients after rTMS treatment using multi-modal MRI techniques. Specifically, the investigators sought to determine whether rTMS treatment modulate the brain function and structure in patients and, if so, whether different frequency of the rTMS treatment will affect the degree of the motor recovery in patients' brain.

The patients will be randomized into three groups: Experimental group 1 (TMS group) received low frequency rTMS; Experimental group 2 (TMS group) received high frequency rTMS; The third group who received only physical therapy constituted the control group. All patients undergo MRI scan one day before and after rTMS treatment."
NCT03528993,"Stroke,one of the leading cause of death, is caused by ischemia or hemorrhage. It results in neurological deficits such as hemiplegia. Hemiplegia show disability characterized loss of motor, sensory and cognitive function. Reduced postural control and balance stability results gait disturbances such as asymmetric weight bearing, risk of falling and imbalances. It also shows increased energy expenditure, decreased independence on quality of life and limited mobility. Physical therapy can be effective method for solving these problems. Hippotherapy, also known as horseback riding therapy, is a form of physical therapy strategy that uses equine movement. The concept of hippotherapy is to use a horse as a therapeutic tool, and it is based on similarities in gait between the human and horse. The horse's gait provides patients having motor disabilities with rhythmic and repetitive movements similar to human walking, thereby giving them training opportunities to improve posture, balance, and strength. Even though it has many effect on solving these problems, hippotherapy centers are not enough. Due to climate and environmental situations, hippotherapy devices were improved and had similar effects on patients with stroke. In literature, these device mostly used on cerebral palsy, but investigator wants to use hippotherapy device on patient with Hemiplegia. For these reasons, the effects of exercises by mechanical hippotherapy device on postural control and balance will be investigated."

NCT02053987,"An Early Supported Discharge (ESD) service for stroke is an evidence based intervention that aims to enable a particular group of patients who have a mild to moderate stroke to be discharged from hospital early and receive the same intensity of rehabilitation in their home. Analysis of almost 1600 patients has demonstrated that ESD can reduce long term dependency, decrease admission to institutionalized care as well as shorten hospital stay. This model has also been shown to reduce death and institutionalized care at five years (Fjaetoft et al, 2011) and has been shown to be cost effective (Saka, 2005.) A study by National Heath Service (NHS) London showed that patient outcomes has not been affected by being treated at home and that there have not been an increase in readmissions due to the setting up of an ESD service.

However, those with moderate to severe strokes are often not eligible for ESD rehabilitation.

This study aims to offer twenty Camden residents an Enhanced Early Supported Discharge service in which stroke survivors with moderate to severe impairments are eligible. Participants will be recruited from the University College London Hospital (UCLH)l Hyper Acute Stroke Unit and acute stroke units at UCLH and the Royal Free Hospital.

This study will compare health and economic outcomes of early Multidisciplinary stroke rehabilitation in the community compared to traditional inpatient and community Multidisciplinary rehabilitation for people with moderate to severe post stroke impairments.

We will also collect the views of the participants and their carers regarding being treated at home.

The objectives are to discover:

What impact does the implementation of an Enhanced ESD service for stroke survivors with moderate to severe impairments have on clinical and cost outcomes compared to an unchanged care pathway in a neighbouring borough?
What are the staff, participant and carer views and experiences of an Enhanced ESD service?"

However, sufficient recanalization (mTICI2b-3) can 't be acquired in all patients under thrombectomy. There is a lack of evidence that whether salvage intra-arterial thrombolysis is beneficial for patients with insufficient recanalization after endovascular thrombectomy. The EXTEND-IA TNK study indicated that tenecteplase before thrombectomy was associated with a higher incidence of reperfusion and better functional outcome than alteplase among patients with ischemic stroke treated within 4.5 hours after symptom onset.

NCT03417063,"Stroke has become the leading cause of death in China. It has been shown that intracranial artery stenosis (ICAS) plays a key role in Chinese stroke patients. Although most of stenotic diseases in intracranial arteries are atherosclerotic, a substantial number of other vascular diseases, such as dissection, arteritis, moyamoya disease, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), can also lead to intracranial artery luminal narrowing. It is challenging to differentiate the etiologies of ICAS relying on measuring luminal narrowing by angiographical approaches. In addition, the progression of intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) has been demonstrated to be highly associated with the risk of ischemic cerebrovascular events. However, the influence factors for ICAD progression remains unclear.

High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) has been widely used to assess ICAS diseases. The different etiologies of ICAS are differentiable by MR-MRI according to the features of location, shape, signal pattern, remodeling, and contrast enhancement. Investigators have proved that HR-MRI is a reproducible technique that may be reliably utilized to monitor the changes of ICAD during natural follow-up or medical treatment.

The ICASMAP (Intracranial Artery Stenosis MR Imaging: Aetiology and Progression) is a prospective, cross-sectional, observational, and multicenter study. The objectives of ICASMAP are to determine: 1) the spectrum of etiology of ICAS in stroke patients; and 2) the influence factors for progression of ICAD. A total of 300 patients with symptomatic stenotic disease in intracranial arteries (stenosis range: 30%-99%) will be recruited within two weeks after symptom onset from 18 different hospitals across Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in China within 1 year.

NCT03353519,"No formal primary care based model of care exists to support stroke survivors living in the community. A large variation in the range, quality and access to health services offered to stroke survivors between and within local clinical commissioning groups suggests that many of the stroke survivors' needs are not being met systematically.

NCT03177954,"There is a need to improve the discharge process for patients with stroke, which has been reported to be a particularly stressful time for patients. A Patient Oriented Discharge Summary (PODS) meeting has been shown to be an effective approach for minimizing discharge-related stress and fostering self-management skills in other patients being discharged from rehabilitation into the community. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate whether a PODS meeting can minimize stress around the discharge process and improve patient satisfaction with this process. There are two main hypotheses regarding the PODS program: 1) it will help in-patients with stroke understand key issues related to knowledge required once discharged and 2) it will increase levels of self-efficacy in in-patients with stroke. Potential subjects are encouraged to participate if they are a Sunnybrook - St. John's Rehab admitted in-patient with a stroke diagnosis who are 18 years or older and meet the following criteria: (a) fluent in English; (b) cognitively intact; and (c) have minimal or no aphasia.The participant will be asked to answer some surveys 8-10 days prior to discharge about their knowledge and confidence in managing their stroke.

The participant will then be asked to meet with a clinical staff member who will hold a one-hour PODS meeting. In the meeting, a discharge plan will be created and given to the patient that covers a number of topics that will be useful following their return to the community. One day following the PODS meeting, the participant will be asked to answer the same survey they completed prior to the PODS and again 3-5 days following discharge. If the participant is interested they will be asked to undergo a brief interview to get their feedback on the PODS Program. It is anticipated that about 20 people will participate in the program with all 20 patients completing the surveys with 6 being asked to complete the brief interview.

To the best of the investigators knowledge, there is little risk associated with this study. Participants may become uncomfortable during the interview while discussing their experiences. By participating in this study, patients will be provided with a chance to gather information and learn problem solving and self-management skills prior to discharge.

NCT03263455,"Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide and the third most common cause of disability. The effects of stroke are variable and may include impairments in motor and sensory systems, emotion and neuropsychological deficits such as a disorder of spatial awareness known as unilateral spatial neglect (USN). Approaches to ameliorate USN could be categorized in interventions as involving either bottom-up or top-down processing. The specific mechanisms underlying these effects on a number of manifestations of the USN syndrome may include the restoration of defective representations of the side of space contralateral to the lesion (contralesional), and of the ability to orient spatial attention contralesionally, through complex patterns of activation of both the damaged right hemisphere, and the contralateral left hemisphere, with differences related to the specific stimulation delivered to the patient. In recent years, increasing cutaneous stimuli through neuromuscular kinesiotaping has been proposed to enhance somatosensory inputs (24) and such as method could have positive effects on USN. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of KTM applied on the sternocleidomastoid muscle controlateral side of the lesions in improving USN deficits in individuals with stroke patient in sub-acute phase. The hypothesis is that the KTM application could improved cognitive tests for assessing USN, motor deficits and kinesthetic neck sensibility."

NCT03268798,"Following stroke, muscle weakness and impaired motor function are expressed in both the more (MA; paretic) and less affected (LA; non-paretic) sides. Although the efficacy of resistance training is well recognized, training the MA limb directly may be initially difficult due to muscular weakness. ""Cross-education"" is training one side of the body increases strength in the untrained and opposite side. This concept can be applied in strength training when training the more affected sides cannot be initiated. Recently, our lab found six weeks of dorsiflexion resistance training in the LA leg improved the strength of both trained and untrained legs of chronic stroke participants.

The current project explored if cross-education exists in the upper limb in chronic stroke participants and if there are related changes in cortical and spinal cord plasticity. We hypothesized that unilateral strength in the less affected arm could enhance wrist extension strength bilaterally with related neural adoption and improved clinical function."
NCT03265860,"Ischemic strokes are the first cause of handicap in adult people, the second cause of dementia and the third cause of death in France. Brain Magnetic Resonance (MR) initial assessment is mandatory to get the right diagnosis, to exclude hemorrhagic lesions and to determine the best treatment.

The conventional diffusion weighted imaging sequence is used to establish the diagnosis and to estimate the volume of ischemic lesions. The perfusion weighted imaging sequences are also used to assess the diffusion-perfusion mismatch which is supposed to be the ischemic penumbra corresponding to territories that could be saved with appropriate treatments.

IntraVoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) is a multi-b diffusion sequence which allows to extract four quantitative variables (D, D*, f, ADC) related to the true molecular diffusion and correlated to the microvascular perfusion.

It's a quick sequence with no need of contrast injection and allowing a perfect coregistration with the true diffusion. It has been validated in many pathologies but not in acute strokes.

The feasibility of this sequence in acute ischemic strokes has already been assessed with interesting results.

The study aims to assess the correlation between the quantitative values of IVIM at initial MR exam and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 3 months after an acute ischemic stroke."

Aim of our study was to assess whether Ekso would foster the recovery of deteriorated FPN connectivity and SMP patterns involved in limb coordination during walking in a sample of patients with hemiparesis due to stroke.

Twenty outpatients were consecutively included in this study according to the following inclusion criteria: (i) age ≥55 years; (ii) a first-ever ischemic supra-tentorial stroke (confirmed by MRI scan) at least 6 months before their enrollment; (iii) an unilateral hemiparesis, with a Muscle Research Council -MCR- score ≤3; (iv) ability to follow verbal instructions, with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) >24; (v) a Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) score ≤2; (vi) no severe bone or joint disease; and (vii) no history of concomitant neurodegenerative diseases or brain surgery.

Patients were randomly assigned to the experimental (Ekso gait training -EGT) of control group (conventional overground gait training -OGT- at a velocity matched to the Ekso gait training)."
NCT03171649,"Stroke is the third most common cause of death and the main cause of acquired adult disability in high-income countries. The most common deficit after stroke is motor impairment of the contralateral arm, with more than 80% of stroke survivors experiencing this condition in the acute phase, and only half regaining some useful upper limb function after six months.

Within the European project RETRAINER (grant agreement No 644721), the consortium developed a platform for the rehabilitation of the upper limb after stroke, which combines a passive arm exoskeleton for weight relief supporting both shoulder and elbow movements, Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) of the two-most impaired muscles of the affected side, interactive objects, and voluntary effort. The system also provides a graphical user interface which helps the therapist set the training session and save the training data and parameters, and provides the subject a visual feedback about his/her active involvement in the exercise. The training consists of the execution of a series of exercises involving the affected arm during daily life activities. Typical exercises are anterior reaching on a plane or in the space, moving an object on a plane or in the space, moving the hand to the mouth, with or without an object in the hand, and lateral elevation of the shoulder.

The aim of this clinical study it to evaluate the efficacy of this novel training platform on patients between two weeks and nine months after their first stroke, who preserved at least a visible muscle contraction for the arm and shoulder muscles. Participants are randomized in an experimental and a control group. The control group is trained with an advanced rehabilitative program, including physical training, occupational therapy, FES, and virtual reality, while the experimental group is trained with the RETRAINER system for about 30 minutes, in addition to the same program of the control group. The daily training time is the same for the two groups. The intervention consists of three sessions a week for nine weeks. Patients are assessed at baseline, soon after the end of the intervention, and in a 4-week follow-up visits. It is planned to recruit 68 subjects for this study.

Since the RETRAINER platform was built on the up-to-date theory of motor re-learning, which supports task-oriented repetitive training, a close temporal association between motor intention and stimulated motor response, and an intensive and frequent training paradigm, the study's hypothesis is that the experimental group shows a greater treatment effect than the control group."

NCT04540978,"Being active early after stroke prevents secondary complications, reduces hospital length of stay and improves long-term functional outcomes. Early mobilization and early rehabilitation are the means to achieve activity at the early phase post-stroke. Performance of out-of-bed activity at an acute care setting is partially dependent on the routines used in the acute care setting, however, knowledge the knowledge about associations between clinical routines and the characteristics of out-of-bed activity is limited. Also, there is limited knowledge about institutional barriers to such activity.

Accordingly, the goal of the current study is, in acute hospital inpatient setting, to: 1) characterize stroke patients' activity according to shifts (i.e. morning and evening), 2) test associations between out-of-bed activity and patients' clinical status and 3) identify barriers to activity.

The study is a prospective observational study that monitors physical activity in people after stroke while they in an acute stroke care setting, and records berries for out-of-bed activity including being in sitting or standing and walking.

Patients are included if they admitted to the hospital within 48 hours of symptom onset, passed routine initial neurologic and nursing examinations within 48 hours of admission, and have score of 5-18 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS).

This includes accurately interpreting the tactile cues arising at one's fingertips when touching an object. Currently, tactile perception is assessed in individuals with stroke using passive protocols. Research has yet to explore whether activating one's muscles impacts the tactile perceptual process in individuals with stroke despite previous research demonstrating the effect of muscle activation on tactile perception in individuals who are neurologically intact. The proposed research will be the first to address the impact of muscle activation, in addition to stroke, on tactile perception. As such, the proposed research is significant for advancing our understanding of the extent to which tactile deficits occur in individuals with stroke, particularly during volitional movement."

NCT03367286,"Acute ischemia stroke (AIS) is the leading cause of death in China. Thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has been proven to reduce disability in AIS patients within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. However, only 2% of AIS patients received thrombolytic therapy in China.

Perfusion imaging is demonstrated to increase the rate of thrombolytic therapy by identifying the ischemic infarct core (the brain tissue that is irreversibly injured) and the ischemia penumbra (the brain tissue surrounding the ischemia infarct core that is hypoperfused but still viable) for those patients with extending therapeutic window (beyond the current 4.5 hours after symptom onset), as well as minor stroke or those with atypical symptoms.

Three prospective clinical trials, DEFUSE, DEFUSE-2 and EPITHET, has confirmed that mismatch between perfusion weighted-imaging (PWI) and diffusion weighted-imaging (DWI) correspond to the ischemic penumbra whereas DWI provides information of the ischemia infarct core and major reperfusion relate to good clinical outcome in extending therapeutic window AIS patients with DWI-PWI mismatch.

Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) may be a potential alternative technology for recognition of reversibly damaged brain tissue in AIS patients, with the prominent advantage of fast scan. Recent studies also demonstrated that CTP could select eligible candidates for reperfusion therapy. More recently, with data of EXTEND-IA, reperfusion therapy in AIS patients with CTP mismatch (using a CT time to maximum >6 s as ischemic hypoperfusion volume and a CT relative cerebral blood flow <30% of that in normal tissue as ischemic core volume) were related to good clinical outcome.

However, plenty of studies demonstrated CT cerebral blood volume did not always predict ischemic infarct core in AIS patients. A recent study also confirmed the poor contrast: noise ratios of CT cerebral blood volume and CT cerebral blood flow result in large measurement error, compared with those of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), making it problematic to substitute DWI in selecting individual AIS patients for reperfusion treatment.

Based on those studies, it is still remained unclear whether CTP can be an alternative choice to replace magnetic resonance perfusion (MRP) in AIS patients with extending therapeutic windows. So in this study, the investigators try to determine whether baseline CTP profiles have a comparable ability to MRP in identifying patients who have a robust clinical response after early reperfusion."

NCT03045055,"Ischemic stroke, which is due to the occlusion of a cerebral blood vessel, comprises nearly 80-90% of all strokes. Currently, reperfusion of the salvageable tissue via thrombolytic drug or endovascular treatment is the most effective strategy to reduce brain damage. However, after recanalizing the occluded vessels, subsequent reperfusion injury is inevitable. It may not only weaken the therapeutic effects of timely reperfusion but also impede patients' recovery. Moreover, thousands of neuroprotective drugs effective in experimental models have been proved to be unsuccessful in clinical trials. Therefore, effective strategies are urgently needed to prevent and treat cerebral reperfusion injury and further improve the prognosis of acute ischemic stroke.

Researchers applied remote ischemic conditioning to mouse model of focal cerebral reperfusion injury and found that it could reduce cerebral infarct size. And clinical researches demonstrated that remote ischemic conditioning was an effective strategy to improve cerebral perfusion and prevent recurrent stroke in patients with ischemic stroke. However, whether remote ischemic conditioning is safe and effective in protecting patients with large-vessel ischemic stroke and undergoing endovascular treatment is still unclear. The investigators' hypothesis is that RIC is a safe and effective strategy to reduce brain injuries in stroke patients undergoing endovascular treatment."

NCT03041753,"Background: stroke is a major cause of death and disability. Intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy are able to re-open occluded vessels and save the ischemic tissue from death. However, recanalization of the occluded vessel may trigger activation of detrimental molecular pathways and exacerbate blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption, eventually determining hemorrhagic transformation (HT) or cerebral edema (CE), causing the so-called ""reperfusion injury"". There is increasing evidence that a number of factors measurable as circulating biomarkers, particularly metalloproteinases (MMP), contribute to reperfusion brain injury. Preliminary data show that BBB disruption can be traced in vivo by Computed Tomography Perfusion (CTP) imaging. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of circulating and imaging biomarkers in relation to reperfusion injury.

Methods: consecutive patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation territory, scoring≥7 on NIHSS, candidates to intravenous thrombolysis or to endovascular treatment, will be enrolled in one hospital centre. Circulating levels of pro-, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory factors, metalloproteinases and their inductors/inhibitors, factors of endothelial dysfunction and fibrin resistance to lysis will be measured in blood samples taken from each patients pre-thrombolysis and 24 hours after thrombolysis. Biomarker levels will be studied in relation to CTP measures of BBB permeability and in relation to imaging signs of reperfusion injury after acute interventions, such as hemorrhagic transformation and cerebral edema.

Results: enrollment started on October 2015. As of January 2017, 70 patients have been included. Results are expected by the end of 2018 with an estimated sample size of 140 patients. Using a definite protocol, a prospective collection of data, and an adequate number of patients assuring statistically powered data, this study will integrate clinical information with imaging and biological factors involved in reperfusion injury after cerebral ischemia."

NCT01526824,"In patients who have suffered an ischemic stroke or TIA (mini-stroke), as well as in patients who are candidates for neuroendovascular stenting, it is standard of care to treat these patients with antiplatelet therapy, or ""blood-thinners"", the most common of which is clopidogrel (Plavix) with or without the addition of aspirin. A relatively common problem encountered with these patients is non-responsiveness to clopidogrel therapy. A prior study in cardiac patients showed that the addition of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Lovaza, or ""fish oil"") can increase a patient's response to therapy with clopidogrel, but there have been no studies in neuro patients. In this study, patients will be divided into one of two groups: in the study arm, patients will receive clopidogrel +/- aspirin as well as Lovaza. In the control arm, patients will only receive clopidogrel +/- aspirin. Assays will be done to measure responsiveness to clopdiogrel on days 0, 12-24 hours after loading dose, day 3-5 if still inpatient, and at a follow-up visit 20-30 days after the start of the study. The investigators believe that this study will show an increase in platelet aggregation in patients receiving both clopidogrel and Lovaza."
NCT02230280,"Most stroke survivors live with other chronic health conditions that can negatively affect their recovery and overall health and well-being. Although stroke care has improved, there are still many challenges to the delivery of community-based stroke care. These challenges include: poor coordination of care across health care providers and settings; limited communication among health care providers; limited use of evidence-based treatment guidelines; difficulties navigating community services and supports; and limited client and family caregiver involvement in making healthcare decisions.

NCT01550588,"Background and hypothesis:

The appropriate treatment strategy for secondary stroke prevention in patients with cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale (PFO) remains challenging. Clinical and anatomical variables reported to be risk factors associated with stroke recurrence include older age, large PFO, large right-to-left shunting, and combined atrial septal aneurysm (ASA), which, however, were not confirmed by other studies. The investigators hypothesized that percutaneous closure of PFO could be an effective option for secondary prevention in cryptogenic stroke patients with high-risk PFO.

Trial Objective:

The primary objective of this study is to assess whether percutaneous device closure of PFO is superior to conventional antithrombotic treatment in preventing stroke recurrence in the cryptogenic stroke patients with high-risk PFO."
NCT01548781,"Disturbances in movement coordination are the least well understood but often the most debilitating with respect to functional recovery following stroke. These deficits in coordination are expressed in the form of abnormal muscle synergies and result in limited and stereotypic movement patterns that are functionally disabling. The result of these constraints in muscle synergies is an abnormal coupling between shoulder abduction and elbow flexion (i.e. the flexion synergy), which significantly reduces the reaching function of an individual with stroke when they lift up the weight of the impaired arm against gravity. The investigators previous neurotherapeutic research, supported by a NIDRR Field Initiated research grant, has shown that the abnormal synergy between shoulder abduction and elbow flexion can be significantly reduced thus increasing total reaching range of motion in individuals with severe stroke. The previous work established progressive abduction loading as a key element to the rehabilitation of reaching. Although individuals with severe stroke benefited from the investigators previous work, residual flexion synergy continued to hinder normal arm function in most participants with severe stroke. This study will utilize the ACT3D robot, developed as part of the investigators previous NIDRR project, to incorporate resistance to reaching while accounting for the known benefits of progressive abduction loading. The investigators propose to randomize forty participants with severe stroke into two closely related interventions. The groups will both practice reaching under abduction loading, however, the experimental group will also move against resistance while reaching. Rigorous and quantitative investigation of therapeutic elements such as resistance to reaching and progressive abduction loading is only possible with a device such as the ACT3D. the investigators will be able to standardize the delivery of each intervention using kinematic and kinetic parameters, which will allow for a clear identification of the therapeutic effect of resistance to reaching. the investigators hypothesize that resistance to reaching in combination with progressive abduction loading will further increase dynamic multi-joint strength, increase total reaching range of motion, and increase arm function thus enhancing actual amount of use of the arm, participation in life roles, and quality of life in individuals with severe stroke."
NCT05388552,"The occurrence of abnormal movements is a frequent reason for consultation in neurology. The etiologies are broadly separated into ""primary causes"", intrinsically neurological diseases (of genetic or degenerative origin), and ""secondary causes"". In addition to certain medications or toxic substances, brain damage can be a cause. In this register, 22% of involuntary abnormal movements are related to a stroke and 1 to 4% of strokes are complicated by abnormal movements.

These are manifested by a parkinsonian syndrome or conversely by hypercinesia which can take the form of chorea or ballisms. Most hyperkinetic movements occur in the acute phase of the neurovascular event.

The frequency of these abnormal movements is still uncertain and their semeiological description has been the subject of only rare publications. It seems relevant to be interested in the frequency of these neurological phenomena and has their semeiologic characteristic"

NCT01561092,"Growing international scientific evidence has indicated a positive effect of SSRI treatment (serotonin reuptake inhibitors) after stroke, beyond its antidepressant effect. We wish to conduct a prospective randomised double blind placebo-controlled multicenter study of the combined neuroprotective and antithrombotic effects of SSRI treatment after stroke. Deletion of the SERT (serotonin transporter) gene may influence this treatment effect and may in itself be a risk factor for stroke, an aspect we also wish to explore.

Hypotheses:

SSRI treatment commenced in the acute phase of stroke (day 2-5) protects against new thromboembolic events and leads to better rehabilitation.
A specific SERT genotype is associated with an increased risk of first ever stroke.
A specific SERT genotype is associated with a higher risk of post stroke depression.

NCT03666533,"Stroke affects upwards of 800,000 Americans every year and has an enormous impact on the well-being of the American Veteran population with 6,000 new stroke admissions every year. Many of these stroke survivors are living with walking disabilities. Gait problems result in inability to function independently, high risk of falls and poor quality of life. Unfortunately, current gait rehabilitation treatments are limited and many stroke survivors do not achieve full recovery. Therefore, it is critical to develop new approaches to enhance gait rehabilitation methods. The investigators propose to evaluate a brain stimulation treatment called transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) that can be added to physical therapy. tDCS has been applied for arm rehabilitation after stroke with positive results, but gait-related investigations are lacking. The investigators will test whether simultaneous tDCS and gait training produces greater improvement in walking abilities than gait training alone. Adjunct tDCS therapy may improve outcomes, and reduce cost of both rehabilitation and post-stroke care."

Moreover, the studies evaluating the clinical benefit of mental practice in stroke so far are mostly small feasibility studies, while the few randomized controlled trials reported had relatively small sample sizes. As such, the evidence for mental practice in the treatment of movement disorders following stroke, and other neurological conditions, remains somewhat anecdotal.

The recovery of motor function is crucial for the patient to regain independence and quality of life. Identifying early predictors of motor recovery and outcomes is useful for planning personalized rehabilitation programs and increasing their efficiency. However, making predictions using a single clinical assessment is often difficult and a combination of multiple tools is required. In the last decades, were validated two predictive algorithms for upper limb function and independent walking that can be easily implemented into clinical practice with the aim of increasing knowledge on expected outcome after stroke in patients, families and rehabilitation teams. This will be the first single-site randomized control trial that will test the implementation of such tools in a rehabilitation setting in Italy."
NCT05273216,"Endovascular stroke treatment with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has become the standard therapy for intracranial large vessel occlusion (LVO). The most serious MT-related complication is secondary intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) occurring in 20-25%. Post- recanalization hyperperfusion might be an important risk factor/mechanism of MT-related ICH. In pilot studies, bedside transcranial Duplex sonography (TCD) was identified as a promising screening tool for cerebral hyperperfusion predicting ICH - the hallmark feature of reperfusion injury.

There is an unmet need to identify risk factors for ICH after MT as it relates to poor prognosis, no proven treatment is available, and it delays/prohibits usage of anticoagulants/-thrombotics necessary for preventing recurrent stroke.

Main objectives:

To explore the range and clinical impact of hemodynamic changes after MT as detected on bedside TCD.
To assess whether patients with increased blood flow velocity in the recanalized middle cerebral artery (MCA) are at a higher risk to develop ICH / vasogenic brain edema (reperfusion injury) after MT.
To investigate if the underlying mechanism is cerebral hyperperfusion (confirmed by perfusion MRI).
To additionally study the role of blood biomarkers of blood-brain-barrier / endothelial dysfunction and neuroaxonal damage on reperfusion injury and short-term prognosis.

Approach / methods:

Prospective, longitudinal Austrian multicentre study conducted at three high-volume stroke centers (Graz, Innsbruck, Salzburg). The investigators will recruit consecutive stroke patients with anterior circulation L VO treated by MT. Immediately after MT, experienced sonographers will perform bedside TCD to determine MCA blood flow status, which will be repeated after 24-48h and on day 7. On day one after MT, brain MRI with perfusion serves to assess infarct size, secondary ICH, (vasogenic) brain edema and perfusion status. MRI will be centrally analyzed in the neuroimaging lab of Graz, blinded to clinical, laboratory and sonographic information. Blood samples for the analysis of biomarkers of endothelial (blood-brain barrier) dysfunction and neuroaxonal damage (neurofilament light) will be taken on day one and at three months post-MT. Neurological outcome will be rated according to the modified Rankin Scale at three months post-stroke.

Level of originality:

Human studies on reperfusion injury after MT are lacking. If the investigator's hypothesis would hold true and the investigators could show that cerebral hemodynamic changes after MT would increase the risk for post-interventional intracranial bleeding complications and poor outcome, the investigators would provide an easy-available, repeatable bedside screening and monitoring tool (TCD), which has the potential to guide individualized patient treatment in the early postinterventional period after MT.

The study was registered on Clinicaltrials.gov after start of recruitment."
NCT01622517,"The overall goal of the CTP to predict Response to recanalization in Ischemic Stroke Project (CRISP) is to develop a practical tool to identify acute stroke patients who are likely to benefit from endovascular therapy.

The project has two main parts. During the first part, the investigators propose to develop a fully automated system (RAPID) for processing of CT Perfusion (CTP) images that will generate brain maps of the ischemic core and penumbra. There will be no patient enrollment in part one of this project.

During the second part, the investigators aim to demonstrate that physicians in the emergency setting, with the aid of a fully automated CTP analysis program (RAPID), can accurately predict response to recanalization in stroke patients undergoing revascularization. To achieve this aim the investigators will conduct a prospective cohort study of 240 consecutive stroke patients who will undergo a CTP scan prior to endovascular therapy. The study will be conducted at four sites (Stanford University, St Luke's Hospital, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and Emory University/Grady Hospital). Patients will have an early follow-up MRI scan within 12+/-6 hours to assess reperfusion and a late follow-up MRI scan at day 5 to determine the final infarct."
NCT01594190,"Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in Europe and United States and the second leading cause of death worldwide and affects more than 10,000 Danes each year.

Studies in a late and stationary phase after stroke have shown that physical rehabilitation is of great importance for survival and physical ability of these patients, however many studies show that patients lie or sit next to their bed under hospitalization for more than 88.5 % of the daily hours. Physical activity in stroke patients has never previously been measured immediately after debut of symptoms; furthermore there is no knowledge about the optimal dose of physical rehabilitation for these patients.

Accelerometers, small measuring devices, are a relatively new way to measure physical activity precisely, and hence it is possible to obtain an objective measure of how active stroke patients are in the first week after admission. The accelerometers measure a variable voltage, depending on the range and intensity of movement. They can measure movement dependent of the placement of the accelerometer, for instance over the hip, arm or leg. Studies confirm their reliability, even in patients with abnormal gait, such as stroke patients.

Another approach of studying the effects of physical activity and rehabilitation is through the examination of biomarkers. Studies have shown that biomarkers released during physical activity can inhibit biomarkers released after tissue injury in the brain, as seen after stroke. These brain biomarkers cause further damage and studies show that the higher the levels, the higher the damage. It is therefore obvious to examine whether physical activity rehabilitation can down regulate this destructive process in patients with stroke.

Clarification of the optimal dose of physical activity in stroke patients immediately after debut of symptoms and examination of both the biochemical aspects of physical rehabilitation as well as the optimal dose of physical rehabilitation is of great importance for many patients, their relatives as well as of a great socioeconomic importance.

The purpose of the project is to investigate which dose (15 vs. 2 x 30 minutes) of physical activity on a weight-bearing treadmill in the first 5 days after admission after an ischemic stroke, gives patients the best improvement in neurological dysfunction."

NCT04550793,"Spasticity of stroke patient, a very common complication in clinical practice, affects performance of hand function and gait pattern. It also interferes with quality of life of patients severely. Currently first line clinical approach to spasticity consist of physical therapy and pharmacological management. However, there are still some refractory cases that needed local intervention such as Botox injection.

So far, we only can use subjective methods to measure muscle tension, such as modified Ashworth scale and Tone Assessment Scale. In our previous study, we found that ultrasound shear wave image could correlate with muscle stiffness caused by poststroke spasticity. With this new method, we aim to establish a more objective method in measuring abnormal poststroke muscle tension before and after treatments and further monitor therapeutic effect. We also include several assessment scales to evaluate the correlation between measured muscle spasm and activity of daily living.

We hypothesize that the rheological changes in muscles muscle spasm after Botox injection can be detected by ultrasound shear wave image. Therapeutic effect can also be seen in its effect on daily functions.

In this project, we will use shear wave imaging of ultrasound to investigate the elasticity (and hardness) of the biceps brachii and brachialis muscle in stroke patients with unilateral hemiplegia before and after Botox injection. The findings of this project will provide the objective evaluation of muscle spasticity and its correlation with functional status, which will provide new points of view toward treatment of spasticity."

Furthermore, the loss of autonomy is the most strongly correlated variable in these emotional disorders. In addition, emotional disturbances - in particular anxiety, sadness, crying, and anhedonia - are interpreted as natural reactions to the loss of physical capacity. Along these lines, it has been shown that the use of Virtual Reality (VR) as a co-adjuvant therapy of neuro-rehabilitation in stroke patients with emotional disorders decreases the incidence of these disorders."
NCT05268861,"Stroke leads to lasting problems in using the upper limb (UL) for everyday life activities. While rehabilitation programs depend on motor learning, UL recovery is less than ideal. Implicit learning is thought to lead to better outcomes than explicit learning. Cognitive factors (e.g., memory, attention, perception), essential to implicit motor learning, are often impaired in people with stroke. The objective of this study is to investigate the role of cognitive deficits on implicit motor learning in people with stroke. The investigators hypothesize that 1) subjects with stroke will achieve better motor learning when training with additional intrinsic feedback compared to those who train without additional intrinsic feedback, and 2) individuals with stroke who have cognitive deficits will have impairments in their ability to use feedback to learn a motor skill compared to individuals with stroke who do not have cognitive deficits.

A recent feedback modality, called error augmentation (EA), can be used to enhance motor learning by providing subjects with magnified motor errors that the nervous system can use to adapt performance. The investigators will use a custom-made training program that includes EA feedback in a virtual reality (VR) environment in which the range of the UL movement is related to the patient's specific deficit in the production of active elbow extension. An avatar depiction of the arm will include a 15 deg elbow flexion error to encourage subjects to increase elbow extension beyond the current limitations. Thus, the subject will receive feedback that the elbow has extended less than it actually has and will compensate by extending the elbow further. Subjects will train for 30 minutes with the EA program 3 times a week for 9 weeks. Kinematic and clinical measures will be recorded before, after 3 weeks, after 6 weeks, and after 9 weeks. Four weeks after the end of training, there will be a follow-up evaluation. Imaging scans will be done to determine lesion size and extent, and descending tract integrity with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).

This study will identify if subjects with cognitive deficits benefit from individualized training programs using enhanced intrinsic feedback.

Studies in a late and stationary phase after stroke have shown that physical rehabilitation is of great importance for survival and physical ability of these patients, however many studies show that patients lie or sit next to their bed under hospitalization for more than 88.5 % of the daily hours. Physical activity in stroke patients has never previously been measured immediately after debut of symptoms; furthermore there is no knowledge about the optimal dose of physical rehabilitation for these patients.

Accelerometers, small measuring devices, are a relatively new way to measure physical activity precisely, and hence it is possible to obtain an objective measure of how active stroke patients are in the first week after admission. The accelerometers measure a variable voltage, depending on the range and intensity of movement. They can measure movement dependent of the placement of the accelerometer, for instance over the hip, arm or leg. Studies confirm their reliability, even in patients with abnormal gait, such as stroke patients.

Another approach of studying the effects of physical activity and rehabilitation is through the examination of biomarkers. Studies have shown that biomarkers released during physical activity can inhibit biomarkers released after tissue injury in the brain, as seen after stroke. These brain biomarkers cause further damage and studies show that the higher the levels, the higher the damage. It is therefore obvious to examine whether physical activity rehabilitation can down regulate this destructive process in patients with stroke.

Clarification of the optimal dose of physical activity in stroke patients immediately after debut of symptoms and examination of both the biochemical aspects of physical rehabilitation as well as the optimal dose of physical rehabilitation is of great importance for many patients, their relatives as well as of a great socioeconomic importance.

The purpose of the project is to investigate feasibility of treadmill training on a weight-bearing treadmill in the acute phase after admission after an ischemic stroke. Furthermore we wish to investigate the acute inflammatory response after ischemic stroke and whether it changes with treadmill training."

NCT04484350,The aim of DETECT is to prove the feasibility of a multicenter phase III trial testing the hypothesis that intensive blood pressure control immediately after successful endovascular stroke thrombectomy can improve patient outcomes. Patients with stroke who have ongoing high blood pressure after successful clot retrieval will be included. Participants will be randomly placed (like flipping a coin) in one of two groups. There will be a 50% chance of each patient being placed to either group. The first group will be allowed to have a higher blood pressure range that is consistent with current recommendations. The second group will be given medications to bring their blood pressure down into a normal range. These blood pressure targets will be maintained for 48 hours. We will collect patient brain images and levels of stroke disability up to 90 days after their clot retrieval.

NCT01706094,"A simplest manner to augment cerebral blood flow to irrigate the ischemic penumbra in acute ischemic stroke could be to place the patient in a 'lying flat' rather than upright head position. Given uncertainty over the balance of potential modest benefits and risks, and variability regarding the ideal head position policy for patients with acute ischemic stroke around the world, reliable randomized evidence is required to standardize clinical practice.

The main objectives of this pilot phase clinical trial are to determine the feasibility, safety and potential efficacy of a large-scale cluster randomized clinical trial to assess whether a simple nursing care policy - 'lying flat head position' - provides beneficial effects as compared to the standard upright head position in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The main efficacy outcome of the pilot phase is demonstration of increased mean cerebral blood flow velocity in the flat down compared to the upright head position, as assessed by transcranial Doppler to the medial cerebral arteries of patients with anterior circulation infarction. Secondary efficacy objectives are to demonstrate that the flat down head position improves neurological status at 7 days and disability at 90 days."

NCT01751373,"Within the first year after stroke, approximately 38% of stroke survivors experience an increased resistance to movement, also called spasticity. One type of treatment that is approved for stroke survivors in Canada that could reduce spasticity is the injection of Botulinum toxin (BTX) into the affected muscle. While BTX reduces spasticity, there is limited evidence to show that BTX administration leads to functional improvements. This may occur because the outcomes aren't sensitive enough to detect change, some people may have better responses to BTX, or because BTX hasn't been paired with the right exercises to improve function. The aims of this research are: i) to determine if there is a way of improving the markers that measure change in response to treatment; and ii) to identify the ideal type of exercise that should be paired with BTX to allow the drug to have it greatest effect.

There are two primary research questions: a) What are the measures that will indicate whether a person with post-stroke spasticity will benefit from BTX therapy? It is hypothesized that EMG latency and amplitude, for those who best respond to BTX, will differ from those who demonstrate a weaker response to BTX; b)What is the ideal training approach for improving muscle function in stroke survivors receiving BTX injections? It is hypothesized that a training protocol that focuses on optimizing specific muscle activation patterns will demonstrate better outcomes than a training program designed to improve function."

NCT03467269,Today the treatment of ischemic stroke in acute phase is based on medicinal or endovascular revascularization. Cerebral MRI sequences help the diagnostic. This procedure uses deoxyhemoglobin as an endogenous tracer. This is also a scorer of cerebral ischemia and the increase lets visualized transcerebral veins in the suffering zone giving a brush aspect. Several studies show the interest of this sign and conclude that deoxyhemoglobin presence is a predictive factor of cerebral ischemia.

NCT01774669,"The patient study is a phase III trial designed as a single-blinded, randomised, controlled multi-centre trial with repeated measurement events (ME). Patients will be evaluated by a blinded assessor on five occasions: twice within two weeks at baseline before intervention start (BL, T0), once after eight treatment sessions (T1), once after the intervention (T2), and once after a two month follow-up period (FU). Figure 1 illustrates the study overview.

The study focuses on the evaluation of the YouGrabber efficacy compared to conventional therapy in an outpatient setting.

Research question: Do patients after stroke in the YouGrabber training group show higher postintervention performance in the Box and Block Test (BBT) compared to patients in the conventional therapy group? Hypothesis: H0: The investigators hypothesise that there will be no group differences after 16 training sessions or after the two month follow-up period.

H1: The investigators hypothesise that there will be a group difference after the 16 training sessions and after the two month follow-up period.

Aim: The aim of the project is to design and implement a single-blinded, randomised controlled multi-centre trial comparing YouGrabber training and conventional therapy in patients after stroke.

Patients will be randomly allocated to either the experimental group (EG) or the control group (CG) after the second ME (T0). Group allocation will be based on a computer-generated randomisation list (one for each centre, (MATLAB, 2007b, Mathworks Inc., USA) created by a researcher not involved into the study. Randomisation lists and corresponding token will be stored in the clinics' pharmacy. Patients will draw a token before the first therapy session. The token will be marked and stored until study finalisation in the pharmacy.

Group allocation will remain concealed for the independent assessor until study finalisation. Patients and treating therapists will be reminded not to talk about patient's group allocation with other therapists or participants.

Patients in both study groups (EG, CG) will receive the same amount of 16 sessions lasting for 45 minutes each. During each therapy appointment patients can decide to stop the training at any time.

Patients allocated to EG will have the opportunity to participate in two semi-structured interviews to evaluate their expectations and experiences with the virtual reality therapy with YouGrabber.

Treating therapists will have the opportunity to participate in one focus group meeting to evaluate their experiences with the virtual reality training, its advantages and disadvantages. Interview and focus group participation will be voluntary."

NCT01770184,"Individuals who have a mild stroke have a 44% risk of dying from a second stroke within 10 years which is in large part due to the cyclical relationship of chronic disease, poor health, and mild stroke which has gone largely unnoticed in the United States. Self-management intervention has been proven to be an effective intervention to increase healthy behaviors, improve overall health status, decrease healthcare utilization/cost, decrease depressive symptoms, and improve participation in people with a variety of chronic conditions; however, it has never be used with individuals with mild stroke. The critical next step and goal of this study is to evaluate if self-management intervention will improve health outcomes for persons with mild stroke. The overall hypothesis of this study is that self-management intervention will improve outcomes in the mild-stroke population."
NCT05277389,"Individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) are more likely to have a stroke, more disabled at 3 months, and less likely to be independently ambulatory. Individuals with low SES struggle to adhere to physician guidelines because of 1) increased disability leaves patients ineligible or unable to tolerate therapy, and 2) poor access to quality care i.e., lack of transportation to therapy. To reduce post-stroke disparity in low SES groups, we need to invest in development of novel tools that make therapy more accessible. For the past 5 years, the PI has been developing Startle Adjuvant Rehabilitation Therapy (START), a tele-enabled, low-cost treatment to improve upper-extremity therapy outcomes in individuals with stroke - in particular individuals with severe-to-moderate stroke. START is the application of a startling, acoustic stimulus (via headphones) which increases the intensity of practice, particularly in severe patient populations. START is adjuvant, meaning it does not replace clinical practice but instead enhances current evidence-based treatments. Objective: we seek to determine if START can be used to enhance functionally relevant movement of the upper extremity. Preliminary data: Individuals with severe-to-moderate disability from a stroke completed a remotely delivered, 3-day training of object manipulation with START. Box and Blocks, which was targeted during training, demonstrated a large increase under START (+47.1%) compared to Control (+3.3%). Modified functional reach was also increased under START (+8.9%) compared to Control (+1.1%). Impairment also decreased under START (Upper-Extremity-Fugl-Meyer: +8.6%) resulting in subject-reported increase in arm function both in quantity (Motor Activity Log: +26.2%) and quality (+20.2%). These results indicate that START can be deployed remotely and may prove a valuable, adjuvant tool to enhance functional upper extremity movement. We propose to perform a Phase 1 clinical trial on a larger cohort of 58 subjects, with a longer, 5-day training with the goal of establishing that START can 1) enhance functional movement of the upper extremity and 2) generate sustainable changes that impact quality of life. Impact: This proposal is significant because it tests a tool that has the potential to directly target the causes leading to disparity of care for individuals with low SES. A third (34%) of 6.5 million people in the U.S. with stroke are on Medicaid or uninsured. Our best evidence-based therapies (e.g., high-intensity, CIMT) and our emerging rehabilitation technologies (e.g., TMS, robotics) are inaccessible to our minority and low SES populations. START addresses disparity because it 1) targets individuals with severe disability, which disproportionally affects low SES and minority groups, and 2) is tele-enabled eliminating transportation which 60% of individuals with low SES report as a barrier to care. If successful, this study will set the stage for larger trials to establish 1) the effectiveness of START to be incorporated into traditional therapy and as well as patient compliance, adherence, and tolerance - particularly in low SES groups."

NCT01804439,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important public health problem that affects millions of people worldwide. Associations between risk factors, such as smoking, dyslipidaemia or hypertension, and prevalent CVD are well documented. However, few studies have investigated associations with onset of disease. The initial manifestation of CVD, for example an episode of unstable angina, is important because it influences the prognosis, the quality of life and the management of disease. Furthermore, the extent to which social deprivation, alcohol consumption or atrial fibrillation affects presentation of CVD is poorly understood and deserves further consideration.

Most previous studies have considered CVD as a single entity. However, differences in aetiology between coronary phenotypes suggest that risk factors may not be shared across specific coronary phenotypes and their relative importance is likely to differ for each phenotype. Gaining knowledge of these differences could provide insights into the pathophysiology of specific forms of CVD and could eventually lead to modification of recommendations for patient management and disease prevention.

We propose to use the linkage of the national registry of coronary events to general practice records in the Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD), to investigate whether demographic, behavioral, and clinico-metabolic risk factors differentially influence the onset of specific types of CVD."

NCT01825486,"Background: Accidental falls result in major physical and psychological morbidity in the elderly, especially stroke patients. To get optimal prevention of stroke falls, it is crucial to identify independent risk factors from multivariate analysis of related balance and gait parameters.

Aim: To evaluate the effects of balance and gait characteristics in determining whether or not accidental falls may happen. To investigate if the balance and gait parameters affect the time from lesion to when (and if) patients suffer from falls. To compare differences of balance and gait parameters in accidental fall patients between those with severe accidental injuries and those without severe injuries.

Methods: The 2-year observational cohort study will enroll 706 elderly stroke patients, who have not had a previous stroke. They will be retrieved from the Inpatient department and followed-up regularly in the Outpatient department when they are discharged. All subjects will be evaluated at 1 month and 6 months after stroke. These evaluations will include: mental, cognition and depression status; lower-limb muscle strength assessed by a dynamometer as well as range of motion of joints assessed by a biaxial electro-goniometry; functional independence measure; balance and gait pattern will be assessed by both clinical observation and objective laboratory examination (a dynamic posturography and computerized gait analysis system); falls and fall-related injuries during the proceeding year. Differences in baseline characteristics are tested by one-way ANOVA, Mann Whitney U or t tests, if appropriate. The investigators will identify the independent risk factors of accidental falls with logistic regression and use the log rank statistic of Kaplan-Meier survival curve to differentiate the risk of accidental falls or fall-related injuries in different groups."
NCT04542772,"In Canada, the number of stroke survivors is equivalent to the size of one of the four Atlantic Provinces. The incident rate of stroke has been increasing steadily since 1995. The majority of the stroke survivors lose upper extremity function, resulting in diminished activities of daily living (ADL). Many therapeutic interventions are recommended to improve upper extremity function or ADLs of stroke survivors, however, Mirror Therapy (MT), inexpensive intervention, can be self-administered by stroke survivors with intact cognition. Thus, the research question is whether a self-administered MT technique improves acute stroke patients' upper extremity motor function and recovery?"

NCT01841840,"Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Of those who are affected by stroke, a third becomes permanently disabled. Risk factors for stroke include, but are not limited to, advancing age, physical inactivity, arterial stiffness, and most commonly, high blood pressure. Stroke is a major form of a much boarder problem, cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD is considered the primary cause of death in the US. Interestingly, increased arterial stiffness of elastic arteries (carotid and aorta) has been shown to be strongly correlated to CVD and stroke. Increased arterial stiffness is considered an independent risk for the development of CVD and stroke. Hence, arterial stiffness has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target for CVD and more specifically stroke.

Recently, whole-body vibration (WBV) exercise has been proposed as a new and effective method to improve muscle mass and muscle strength in younger and older individuals. It is known that systemic arterial stiffness decreased 40 min after a single WBV session in healthy men. In our laboratory, we have shown that leg arterial stiffness decreases after a session of WBV. Taken together, this data seems to suggest WBV may be used as a viable way to decrease arterial stiffness. Special populations, such as post-stroke patients, may be unwilling or unable to perform WBV exercise so an inactive form of exercise (vibration) therapy is needed.

Passive vibration (PV), allows patients to lie in an inactive, supine position, with their legs placed onto the vibration plate. This exposes the lower limbs to continuous vibration without performing voluntary muscle contraction. PV has been shown to increase skin blood flow on the vibrated extremity through vasodilation in healthy individuals and type 2 diabetics. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that a 10-min session of PV on the legs decreases augmentation index (AIx) , a marker of pressure wave reflection, as well as leg and systemic PWV through decreases in local peripheral resistance in young men. However, the effects of PV on arterial function in post-stroke patients are unknown.

It is hypothesized that post-stroke patients will demonstrate a decrease in leg PWV and central AIx. However, greater responses are expected with the lower vibration frequency."

NCT01858779,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cause of cardioembolism and a leading cause of ischemic stroke. The diagnosis of AF after cerebral ischemia is difficult to establish even during the treatment at specialised stroke units, as paroxysmal episodes may terminate spontaneously before arrival at the hospital and do not always show early recurrence. However, the diagnosis of AF is of particular clinical relevance since adaequate anticoagulation is one of the most effective secondary preventive treatments in stroke. The detection rate of AF after stroke increases progressively by extending the duration and intensity of cardiac monitoring. For this purpose innovative medical devices and implantable event recorders have been suggested. However, high socioeconomic expenses, malcompliance and the invasiveness of some of these approaches currently limit their use to a minority of affected patients, while the growing number of stroke survivors is lacking access to free and simple screening tools.

For primary prevention, the measurement of the peripheral pulse (MPP) is currently the only guideline-recommended screening method among individuals aged 65 years or older. In contrast, MPP has never been applied in the setting of secondary stroke prevention, probably because several factors were expected to interfere with this simple technique, including sensomotor and neuropsychiologic handicaps of stroke patients 18. This study investigates feasibility and validity of MPP in this cohort (pilot phase) and compares daily MPP for 6 months with repeated holter-ECG in patients after ischemic stroke."

NCT01870492,"Limited access is a major hurdle in the treatment of AIS; many hospitals, especially rural hospitals, do not have the infrastructure or medical support to effectively treat AIS patients.5 Failure to recognize the signs and symptoms of stroke by the patient and/or emergency medical services (EMS) is another barrier to the timely treatment of AIS. Several studies, including the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry (PCNASR), have reported low rates of adherence to stroke care guidelines, suggesting that many AIS patients do not receive proper treatment according to established guidelines. Thus, there remains an increasing need to assess and address the barriers that prevent patient access to proper AIS treatment.

Annually, approximately 20,000 patients are discharged from Wisconsin hospitals with the diagnosis of stroke and an estimated 4,000 patients die from stroke each year in WI. To date, there have been no statewide studies initiated in Wisconsin to assess the regional barriers to the treatment of AIS patients with thrombolytic or endovascular therapy, and many hospitals do not routinely collect and analyze AIS patient data.

The goal of the Improving Patient Access to Stroke Therapy (IMPACT) pilot study is to engage community hospitals statewide to identify the regional barriers to AIS therapy in WI."

NCT01904799,"After a CVA, all of the cognitive functions can be affected and analysed, but the presence of a language disorder may considerably hamper the evaluation of other functions.

The battery of rapid tests to screen for and quantify cognitive disorders, including the MMSE, the MOCA, the R-CAMCOG or the RBANS, are not suitable for aphasic patients because they contain items with a strictly verbal response. Because of this, inexperienced doctors cannot evaluate higher functions (other than language) of aphasics in routine practice. For the same reason, aphasics are regularly excluded from post-cva therapeutic protocols, whether or not the trial bears on the evolution of cognitive functions.

Nonetheless, it is possible to evaluate, at least roughly, all of the cognitive functions without resorting to language.

The investigator have developed , from validated tests and classical clinical manoeuvers, the Cognitive Assessment for Stroke Patients (CASP) :

for the rapid screening (less than 15 minutes) and quantification of post-cva cognitive disorders (6 functions: language, apraxia, short-term memory, temporal orientation, impaired spatial/visio-construction and executive functions);
the CASP can be used in most patients, including those with severe disorders of expression and moderate problems with comprehension, The format of these tests has been adapted so that severe disorders of expression (essentially left-hemisphere CVA), and left spatial impairment (right-hemisphere CVA) do not affect the ability to take the test. Its validity in terms of appearance and content were verified in 2011."

NCT03274947,"The study is designed to explore the effectiveness of non-invasive cerebellar stimulation to enhance motor plasticity in the cortex after stroke. The investigators have shown that the human cerebellum is strongly activated during the act of swallowing and when stimulated with single TMS pulses can strongly facilitate the corticobulbar projection to the pharynx in humans. More recently the investigators have identified the most relevant frequency of stimulation of the cerebellum that can produce longer term excitation in the human swallowing motor system. The investigators therefore believe that the potential for cerebellar stimulation in improving swallowing is much greater than other methods for two reasons. Firstly, previous work has shown that unlike successful recovery of hand/arm function which relies on restoring activity in the stroke hemisphere, recovery of swallowing function relies on increased excitability in intact projections from the non-stroke hemisphere. The investigators believe that methods that can enhance these undamaged pathways have a greater chance of inducing recovery in the human swallowing system in unilateral stroke. Additionally cerebellar stimulation produces very high levels of corticobulbar excitation it may also have the advantage of improving dysphagia in posterior fossa strokes. Second, the human cerebellum is relatively easy to target and stimulate and has reduced risk of inducing unwanted effects (such as seizures) which as a consequence makes cerebellar stimulation a more pragmatic method for delivering therapeutic neurorehabilitation to dysphagic stroke patients compared to other more complex/riskier methods.

A final factor is that the investigators have developed a ""virtual lesion"" model of swallowing dysfunction in healthy volunteers which can be reversed quite successfully with other neuro-stimulation protocols. The investigators can therefore use this model to test the effectiveness of cerebellar stimulation protocols (ipsilateral and contralateral cerebellar sites) before choosing the most effective side to apply stimulation in a proof of principle trial/study in a small group of sub-acute dysphagic patients.

The hypotheses are that cerebellar TMS will:

i. Reverse the brain inhibition and behavioural dysfunction following a virtual lesion model of disrupted swallowing in healthy brain (phase 1); ii. Reduce the degree of aspiration in acute dysphagia after a stroke (phase 2)."

NCT05111821,"Stroke is a major cause of disability over the world. While acute therapies have made huge progresses, the number of survivors leaving with clinical consequences of stroke is increasing. Beyond stroke itself, secondary neurodegeneration of disconnected areas, especially of central hubs such as the substantia nigra or the thalamus, could significantly impact the overall outcome of the patients. Data have identified iron accumulation within the disconnected areas as potentially accelerating neurodegeneration. In this research, the main objective is test whether long-term chelation through Deferiprone (Ferrirpox®, Chiesi) administered daily from 3-to-5 days following stroke to 6 months could avoid iron accumulation as measured with Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within disconnected areas (substantia nigra).

NCT01954212,"Stroke associated pneumonia (SAP) affects a fifth of stroke survivors annually, tripling the risk of death at 30 days and contributing to poorer rehabilitation outcomes, prolonged hospital stays and dependency at discharge. Systematic review evidence indicates that enhanced oral health care (OHC) has a preventative effect on the incidence of pneumonia amongst nursing home populations (absolute risk reductions 6.6% to 11.7%; numbers needed to treat 8.6 to 15.3 individuals). There are strong theoretical reasons to suggest similar benefits might be observed in stroke care settings but current empirical evidence is weak - trial quality (randomisation, blinding, sample size, reporting), intervention description and thus feasibility of translation into clinical practice is very poor. Following an extensive pre-clinical programme of work, investigators now plan the pilot phase (Phase II) of a stepped-wedge cluster RCT of a well-developed and defined complex OHC intervention versus usual OHC.

NCT01962662,"Force generation and force level control are important neuromuscular control mechanism for successful execution of movement for our daily activities. Impaired force level control is a major deficit of motor control in people with stroke. Electromyographic biofeedback (EMG biofeedback) has been suggested by researchers and clinicians to be a useful and effective tool for enhancing control of force level during motor skill learning for people with stroke. Based on the concept of motor-skill learning, practice with variable force levels may be more effective than practice with a constant force level to enhance movement performance. The EMG biofeedback provides a suitable tool for such practice of force level control and hence for motor skill learning. However, research literatures thus far have yet to provide convincing evidences to support this claim. Neural imaging studies have shown corresponding brain reorganization and neural plasticity following physical practice of movement skills in people with stroke. It is curious whether EMG biofeedback augmented physical practice of motor skills enhances brain reorganization. Using brain mapping techniques, in particular, the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we could investigate neural plasticity accompanying motor function changes induced by physical training, and hence may help to develop safer and more effective training parameters. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of variable practiced EMG biofeedback training emphasized on force level control of the ankle muscle on balance and gait performance and the corresponding changes of corticospinal excitability using TMS in people with chronic stroke."

NCT05283174,"Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) is the first line therapy to prevent thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. Previous investigation showed that preceding NOAC therapy was associated with lower severity of ischemic stroke, but with higher in-hospital mortality in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), as compared with antithrombotic agent non-users. Measurement of NOAC level upon acute stroke aids the critical decision of acute management. Real-world data regarding the relationship between the NOAC adherence, the appropriateness of NOAC regimen, or NOAC level in acute stroke and the stroke severity or short-term outcome is lacking. Further, optimal selection for long-term stroke prevention among patients with acute stroke during NOAC therapy remains unclear.

Specific purpose: To analyze the association between NOAC adherence or NOAC level upon acute stroke and stroke severity or stroke outcomes, and analyze the impact of starting or withholding antithrombotic therapy after acute stroke on long-term stroke outcomes.

Specific Aim (Year 1):

To investigate the relationship between NOAC adherence or appropriateness of NOAC dose and acute stroke severity or in-hospital mortality based on National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Another important goal is to prospectively establish a cohort of AF users who developed acute stroke during NOAC therapy in National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) (target: around 100 patients annually), measure the NOAC level upon hospital arrival, record stroke severity, 90-days functional outcomes, post-stroke antithrombotic agents and repeat stable NOAC level in patients who restart NOAC treatment.

Specific Aim (Year 2):

To investigate the relationship between post-stroke antithrombotic therapy, especially changing or retaining preceding NOAC and long-term stroke outcomes based on NHIRD. We will also keep enrolling the prospective cohort and follow the 1-year stroke outcome.

Specific Aim (Year 3):

To complete the process of study enrollment (total: 300 patients) and conduct statistical analysis. The main goal is to finish the Aim 1 and 2 based on NHIRD. In addition, to provide data of emergent NOAC level and stroke severity or short-term outcome, and post-stroke antithrombotic therapy and long-term outcomes based on the prospectively enrolled cohort."
NCT01983618,"Beachchair position is used by many orthopaedic surgeons for shoulder surgery. Most patients undergoing surgery in this position have no complications. However, reported cases of postoperative neurological deficits have highlighted the risk of cerebral and spinal cord ischemia. The etiology of such complications remains unclear. The most plausible explanation for these events would be intraoperative hypotension followed by cerebral hypoperfusion.

General anesthesia is commonly used for shoulder surgery in conjunction with interscalene brachial plexus blockade. During the block, local anesthetic's spread is frequently observed leading to a block of sympathetic fibres. Since all nerves located in the head and neck area go through the stellate ganglion, its block will cause a sympathetic denervation and a decrease of the peripheral vascular resistance, thus increasing the circulation in cerebral blood vessels. In normal situations, there is a vasoconstriction of the cerebral blood vessels in response to a sympathetic stimulation and a vasodilation if sympathetic fibres are blocked.

Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is a non-invasive examination that provides a reliable evaluation of intracranial blood flow in real-time. It can help to detect sudden changes in perfusion and identify potential embolic events. Some studies using TCD have shown an increased ipsilateral cerebral blood flow (CBF) secondary to a reduced vascular tone associated with a stellate ganglion block. Others have shown a reduction of contralateral CBF that could theoretically increase the risk of ischemia in the affected area.

This study will assess the role of interscalene nerve blockade in the protection of cerebral ischemia and preservation of cerebral autoregulation. This study will also aim to identify changes in contralateral CBF.

The investigators hypothesize that:

Interscalene nerve block will increase CBF
Interscalene nerve block will not decrease contralateral CBF
Cerebral autoregulation will be preserved under general anesthesia in conjunction with an interscalene nerve block in this setting."

NCT03247036,"A number of large trials have confirmed the benefits of thrombolysis in acute stroke, but there are gender differences. The authors sought to examine the relationship between sex and outcome after thrombolysis.

Previous reports [1-6] concerning sex-related differences in stroke management and outcome are inconsistent and sometimes difficult to interpret, and so the reasons for gender disparities in stroke outcome have remained unclear. Functional outcomes and quality of life after stroke are consistently poorer in women despite adjustment for baseline differences in age and prestroke function, and the fact that comorbidities and clinical outcomes were not different between women and men [3, 7] . Once the reasons for these differences are better understood, intervention might be possible to help provide the best care for all patients. This work is a continuation and extension of the Ebrictus Study [8-10] . Prior work has suggested sex-based differences in thrombolytic therapy in subjects with acute stroke [11] .The authors will explore whether sex might modify the effect of thrombolysis on survival and functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke [12] beyond the usually evaluated time period of 6 months after stroke and compared this with the group without thrombolytic treatment."

NCT03431909,"Background: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Human urinary kallidinogenase (HUK), a glycoprotein extracted from male urine currently used in China for enhancing cerebral perfusion5, plays a neuroprotective role including promoting angiogenesis, enhancing cerebral perfusion and suppressing the inflammatory response in animals and in patients with respect to regulating the kallikrein-kinin system. In previous clinical research, neurological function scores and cerebral perfusion scans were largely used to evaluate the efficiency of HUK. However, the mechanisms of Further well-conducted, randomized controlled studies using HUK are currently lacking.

Objective: To assess the Human urinary kallidinogenase effects on brain metabolite and cerebral perfusion changes using magnetic resonance spectroscopy and CT perfusion in patients with AIS.

Methods: The investigators plan to do a single-centre randomized, double-blind, controlled trial in which ischemic stroke patients will be randomized to treatment with either HUK or regular treatment within 72 hours of symptom onset. The study includes two MRS and two CTP scannings (before and after 2 week treatment) for all randomized subjects.

The endpoints will include improvement of the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score from baseline, modified Rankin scale (mRS) score and Barthel index at 14 days.

EvHUKMRS will test the following hypotheses:

HUK enhanced N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) 14 days after treatment compared with control group.
HUK group compared to control group when administered 72 hours after onset of AIS improves recovery and functional outcome as assessed by improvement of NIHSS score , mRS score and BI score on day 14 post-stroke.

A positive result will have a significant impact in the management of AIS and pave the way for future studies aimed at finding the optimal dose and formulation of HUK for treating acute ischemic stroke."

The aim of the study is to evaluate whether a hypodensity on native CT within the virtually entire area of hypoperfusion on perfusion CT, i.e. hypoperfusion-hypodensity mismatch, identifies patients within the time window of thrombolysis in a multicenter cohort. The investigators hypothesize hypoperfusion-hypodensity mismatch will identify patients ≤ 4,5 hours of symptom onset with >70% specificity and >85% positive predictive value."
NCT03287739,"Upper limb recovery after stroke is highly predictable early after stroke. Nijland et al. showed that based on two simple clinical bedside tests - 'Shoulder Abduction' and 'Finger Extension' (the so called 'SAFE model' [Stinear et al., 2012]) - measured within the first 72 hours after stroke, ~87% of the patients could be correctly classified as either regaining or not regaining some dexterity (recoverers or nonrecoverers, respectively) (Nijland et al., 2010). This kind of information regarding the patients' functional prognosis allows proper discharge planning, setting realistic rehabilitation goals, and adequate patient information. However, the length of hospital stay after stroke has been decreasing. Therefore, knowledge is needed regarding the ability to make an accurate first prediction within the first 24 hours after stroke onset while using simple clinical bedside assessments. This would facilitate an earlier triage and with that, an accelerated and smooth transition of patients within the stroke care continuum. In addition, a first prediction within 24 hours poststroke has the potential to decrease health care expenses, as length of hospital stay after an acute stroke is ~30% of the total costs (i.e., direct and indirect costs) associated with stroke (Roger et al., 2012; Fattore et al., 2012).

The primary objective of aRISE is to determine the ability of the behavioral biometric impairments 'Shoulder Abduction' and 'Finger Extension' measured <24 hours poststroke to predict outcome of upper limb capacity 3 months after stroke. The secondary aim is to investigate the the added value of other simple clinical bedside tests for predicting outcome of upper limb capacity 3 months poststroke.

aRISE is a prospective longitudinal observational cohort study of 40 first-ever ischemic stroke patients, who will be assessed <24 hours, 7 days and 3 months after stroke onset."
NCT04223414,"Volume expansion is the cornerstone of perioperative hemodynamic optimization. The main objective of volume expansion is to increase and maximize stroke volume. Hemodynamic changes have an impact on the autonomic nervous system. The analysis of heart rate variability allows an exploration of the autonomic nervous system and could therefore provide information on the effect of volume expansion. The Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) is an analgesia monitor based on the concept of heart rate variability. By deviating from its original use, the investigators wish to evaluate the ability of ANI to identify a response to volume expansion."
NCT01521234,"Regaining independent walking is the top priority for individuals recovering from stroke. Thus, physical rehabilitation post-stroke should focus on improving walking function and endurance. However, the amount of walking completed by individuals with stroke attending rehabilitation is far below that required for independent community ambulation. There has been increased interest in accelerometer-based monitoring of walking post-stroke. Walking monitoring could be integrated within the goal-setting process for those with ambulation goals in rehabilitation. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of accelerometer-based feedback of daily walking activity during rehabilitation on the frequency and duration of walking post-stroke."
NCT04189497,"The availability of several high-cost strategies for the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with established cardiovascular disease highlights the necessity of reliable risk stratification of these patients. Several such prognostic models are available for patients with coronary artery disease; however, for patients with ischemic stroke, the available risk stratification schemes are very few and have several limitations.

This study aims to develop a prognostication tool to stratify the risk of cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke.

The development of a well-designed prognostication tool for the stratification of cardiovascular risk in patients with ischemic stroke may assist to the identification of the highest-risk patients and hence, provide useful information to clinicians and authoritative bodies when prioritizing high-cost strategies for secondary stroke prevention."

NCT04044807,"This prospective observational study will be assessing whether it is practical and feasible to use a stroke screening tool (the modified NHISS, mNIHSS) in an adult surgical population. Perioperative stroke is an uncommon but devastating complication of surgery and previous research suggests that stroke symptoms may be missed in this population. This stroke screening tool has been used extensively in non-surgical patients but has not be used in non-cardiac surgical patients. Surgical patients have additional factors that may affect their ability to complete this assessment such as pain medications and sedatives, pain, and use of epidurals and nerve blocks. This study will involve a total of five testing sessions. The first will occur at the time of consent to screen for cognitive impairment via the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), as part of our exclusion criteria. Then over the course of four subsequent visits, participants will be assessed on the mNIHSS to track for any changes before and after their procedure, as well as evaluate the real-life usability of the mNIHSS as a potential tool to screen for stroke in the surgical population."

NCT03936439,"Stroke is the 4th leading cause of mortality in Hong Kong. It also carries considerable socioeconomical consequences due to disability.

Ischemic stroke can be classified by the TOAST classification, which includes large artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, small-artery occlusion and other causes (1). Among which, intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS) had been major cause of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in the Asia Pacific. It was estimated as high as 24.1% of AIS or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) were attributed to ICAS in China (2). Management of ICAS related strokes has been challenging owing to its high rate of recurrence despite medical therapy. Recent randomized clinical trial suggested that aggressive medical therapy may result in reduction in recurrence compared with historical cohorts (3).

Our group has previously observed a 2.5-fold increase in atrial fibrillation related stroke over a 15-year period (4). The inverstigator also observed a decline in ICAS related AIS as well as its recurrent stroke risk throughout the recent years. Possible mechanisms include better management of metabolic risk factors and aggressive secondary prevention. Other possible reasons are increased atrial fibrillation (AF), small vessel disease (SVD) or other stroke mechanisms.

This study is aim to find the evolution of different stroke subtypes in relation to the characteristics of our stroke population over a 15-year period. This may influence territorial prevention strategy."
NCT02129920,"Early recurrence of cardioembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation is common, reaching approximately 6% within 30 days after initial stroke. Therefore, it is preferable to provide early anticoagulation for cardioembolic stroke. However, early anticoagulation may increase the risk of hemorrhagic transformation of cerebral infarcts. It is difficult to decide the timing of initiation for anticoagulant therapy in stroke patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). In 2013 the European Heart Rhythm Association presented the practical guides for oral anticoagulants in NVAF patients, which recommend that the optimal time to start anticoagulant therapy should be determined according to the stroke severity. However, this recommendation is principally an experts' opinion and is not suitable in the clinical practice in Japan.

RELAXED, a multicenter observational study is planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an oral direct activated coagulation factor Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban, for acute ischemic stroke patients with NVAF in consideration of the infarct size, timing of initiation for rivaroxaban medication, and other patient characteristics, and thereby to determine the optimal timing of the initiation during acute ischemic stroke. The consecutive acute ischemic stroke / transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients with NVAF who are treated with rivaroxaban will be enrolled. The infarction size at 0-48 hours after stroke onset will be measured by the diffusion weighted image (DWI) MRI. The primary efficacy endpoint is recurrent ischemic stroke within 3 months. The primary safety endpoint is major bleedings within 3 months. The optimal timing to initiate rivaroxaban during acute ischemic stroke is determined by analysis of co-relation between primary endpoints and the infarct size / time to initiate rivaroxaban."

NCT04523649,"Stroke remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Patients surviving the first ever stroke remain at high risk of stroke recurrence. While the cause of stroke recurrence is multifactional, atrial fibrillation (AF) has been recognized as one of the most important factors for stroke recurrence. Despite the fact that AF related stroke is highly preventable with long-term oral anticoagulation therapy particularly the non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOAC), the arrhythmia is often not diagnosed until stroke recurrence due to its paroxysmal and asymptomatic nature.

Diagnosing AF before stroke recurrence has been recognized as one of the most important objectives for stroke management. Strategies to detection AF in stroke survivors have been recommended including 7-day or 14-day Holter monitoring at the early post-stroke period. There's also study trial exploring the clinical application of insertable cardiac monitor to detect AF in patients with recent cryptogenic stroke.

In the past decade, advance in ECG technology has made possible to record ECG using handheld smartphone accessory devices in household setting. Together with the rapid developing artificial intelligence-based ECG diagnosis and mobile communication, it is possible to remotely monitor hundreds of thousand ECGs from patients at risk of AF. Few randomized trials have assessed the effectiveness of handheld ECG recording device for AF detection in patients with history of stroke. Here we test the hypothesis that long-term home-based ECG monitoring will be more sensitive than standard care in detecting AF in patients with history of stroke but no documented AF for 24 months. Secondarily, we will investigate whether early detection of AF might confer a benefit on longer-term clinical outcomes."
NCT01628055,"The purpose of the study is to evaluate the ability of IVIG to affect the rate of progression of brain ischemia, as evidenced by neuroimaging.

The results of an ongoing epidemiological study indicate that patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) on IVIG replacement therapy have an overall prevalence of stroke that is 5 times less than in the general population. Even more striking is the absence of stroke in IVIG-treated PID patients over 65, while in the same general population age group the stroke prevalence goes up to 8.1%. This suggests that the degree of stroke protection correlates with the length of IVIG treatment, since older PID patients have been treated with IVIG significantly longer than younger ones."

NCT05001958,"One way to help a stroke survivor learn how to use their arm and hand again is to have them watch and replicate ""normal"" arm and hand movements. This type of intervention is called action observation (AO) and has emerged as a potentially powerful therapeutic tool to improve stroke rehabilitation for the weakened arm and hand. AO involves the patient's visual observation of video recorded intact body movements with the intent to perform the same task with their weakened arm and hand. There is behavioral evidence in stroke survivors that movement skills usually gained through physical practice can also be acquired through observation of the skill alone. In preliminary research performed in Dr. Lewis Wheaton's lab at Georgia Tech, AO has been successfully implemented for persons with arm and hand amputations learning how to use their prostheses. AO training in patients with amputations revealed that their movement is improved when they focus their eye gaze on specific aspects of the movement in the video that may maximally benefit the patient. It is unknown if these eye gaze patterns may serve as the mechanism behind AO and differ among those with mild or moderate movement impairments due to stroke. In this study, the investigators seek to identify if experience with AO in stroke survivors with varying levels of impairment has a similar emergence of eye gaze patterns found in people with amputations. The investigators hypothesize that AO augments visuomotor strategies to help support improved movement and enhance rehabilitation strategies in stroke survivors with mild and moderate impairments. The goal of this work is to utilize eye gaze tracking approaches to understand this phenomenon. In addition, the investigators will identify the feasibility of implementing and assessing AO on eye gaze in stroke survivors."

NCT04743830,"In recent publications evaluating scapular kinematics after stroke, it is emphasized that scapular muscles, which affect the performance of upper limbs in daily life, should not be ignored. When the literature is analyzed for these reasons, the studies in which scapular training was added to the treatment plan of upper limb rehabilitation of stroke individuals are inadequate and the existing studies have methodological deficiencies. Also, it is seen that studies which investigate the effects of these exercises on scapular kinematics, the parameters of periscapular muscle thickness and shoulder subluxation are not included. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of scapular training on scapular kinematics, periscapular muscle thickness, shoulder subluxation and upper extremity functionality in stroke individuals. The study was planned to include 2 groups, 1 treatment and 1 control group. The control group will receive Neurodevelopmental Treatment - Bobath exercises, while the treatment group will receive exercises for the muscles around the scapula in addition to Neurodevelopmental Treatment - Bobath exercises. Muscle thickness of periscapular muscles, shoulder subluxation, 3D scapular kinematics, upper extremity and trunk performance, pain, activities of daily living and quality of life will be assessed before and after 8 weeks treatment program.

NCT03350087,"Stroke is the major cause of motor impairment and physical disabilities in the adult population. Spasticity and loss of dexterity are the common problems in stroke. Recently, current interventions, such as cycling training, virtual reality (VR) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), were used for the treatment of upper extremity (UE) dysfunction in patients with stroke. However, few studies investigated the effects of the combinations of different treatment strategies using by integrating brain imaging and motor control studies. This project proposes different novel treatment strategies in the treatment of UE dysfunction in patients with stroke: combined inhibitory/facilitatory rTMS, VR-based cycling training (VCT), and combined rTMS and VCT. We hypothesize that the treatment effect of the combined protocol (optimal rTMS protocol and VCT) is more effective than single treatment due to integration of central and peripheral effects. Different treatment protocols will induce different changes in the brain reorganization and motor control, which further improve motor function, activity, participation, and health related quality of life (HRQOL)."
NCT03471598,"Impaired motor function is common after stroke. Individuals with stroke often exhibit synergic pattern that disturb daily function. It is crucial to identify the movement impairment in the clinical settings. Upright Motor Control Test (UMCT) is one of the tests developed to assess the selective movement control and functional strength in people with central nervous disorders. It can be used to reflect the impairment of motor function and evaluate changes of performance after treatment. Yet is little to know the clinimetrics of the UMCT on clinical utility. To date, only few researches explore that UMCT has some construct and criterion validity.

Therefore, this study aims to 1) establish the inter-rater reliability to administer the UMCT. 2) explore the correlation between the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery after Stroke (FMA) and UMCT. 3). investigate whether the UMCT is able to predict the walking ability in patients with stroke."
NCT04069039,"Stroke leads to impairments at different levels. Not only walking abilities are impaired after stroke but also trunk function, strength, balance and functional performance. Even in the latter phase after stroke, both walking abilities and trunk function remain restricted.

Restoring walking function is often the main goal of rehabilitation after stroke and the focus of post-stroke physiotherapy is often on regaining walking and mobility. Reduced walking ability after stroke is a predictor for discharge to a nursing home and associated with an increased probability of death. In addition, walking endurance, measured by a six-minute walking test, has a high correlation with community reintegration after a stroke.

Both trunk function and the ability to walk are often limited after stroke. A previous study observed that a significant correlation exists between these two functions, when measured with standardized clinical measurement scales . Due to the functional relevance and the link between both functions, further investigation however is warranted. Current lack of knowledge exists in investigating the relation between trunk and gait muscle strength, and this is key for informing clinical practice. For instance, should trunk muscle strength be a significant determinant of gait function, therapy should incorporate specific training for improving trunk muscle strength.

The primary objective of the study is to investigate if trunk muscle function in combination with lower limb muscle function are significant determinants of walking ability after stroke.

Secondly, the investigators will examine if there are other determinants such as cognition, balance, spasticity, ability of performing selective movements and sensitivity of the lower extremities for walking ability."

NCT05024981,"Cerebrovascular Accident affects the majority of the elderly population and its frequency is constantly increasing. The resulting deficits are numerous and lead in particular to an alteration in the quality of walking and autonomy. Numerous rehabilitation techniques have been described. In practice, correction instructions are often given by the therapist while the motor activity is being performed. Walking is a complex activity, as is the processing of dual-task information in elderly stroke patients. It therefore appears interesting to separate the time of motor realization and that of correction instructions. Investigators therefore propose firstly to film the patient during the performance of a walking activity and then, secondly, to analyse the video with the patient, which thus represents a source of delayed feedback. The main objective of the study is to observe the effects of this practice on walking speed. Investigators are comparing two groups of patients: the control group receiving conventional rehabilitation and the experimental group receiving conventional rehabilitation plus sessions with the video tool. They expect to observe a greater improvement in walking speed in the experimental group."

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to improve the constipation of patients with stroke by non-invasive and precise acupoint care.

This study used a single-blind randomized control trial. The neurosurgery ward of a medical center in the north was used as the research site, and patients with ischemic stroke were used as the research objects. The experimental group received precision acupoint care, and the control group received routine care.

Recent clinical trials have shown that endo-vascular thrombectomy is an effective and safe recanalization modality for acute ischemic stroke patients .

Meta-analysis results show that endovascular treatment is associated with a high ratio of successful recanalization rate and a low rate of symptomatic hemorrhage .

Approximately 2.2-37.5% of patients with acute ischemic stroke might encounter early neurological deterioration (END).

Definition of END: An increase in NIHSS ≥4 or an increase in Ia of NIHSS ≥1 within 72 h after recanalization treatment."
NCT04816136,"Ischemic stroke is a major public health issue, likely to cause functional disability. It is well known that sleep has an impact on brain plasticity, and after an ischemic stroke, studies have shown subjective sleep quality alterations and sleep architecture abnormalities.

Furthermore, there is no clear guideline showing the usefulness of a systematic sleep investigation following an ischemic stroke.

The aim of the study is to identify retrospectively correlation between polysomnographic abnormalities (sleep apnea, periodic limb movements, disturbed sleep architecture…) and functional recovery after an ischemic stroke. The study also assesses the impact of sleep abnormalities on survival, and the risk of new cardiovascular event."
NCT04947865,The purpose of this study is to examine the reflex excitability of the rectus femoris in individuals with and without post-stroke Stiff-Knee gait. We use electrical stimulation of the peripheral nerve innervating the rectus femoris for a well-controlled reflex stimulus. We are investigating whether reflex excitability of the rectus femoris correlates with gait kinematics.
NCT04932668,"Spasticity is a common complication post stroke. Post-stroke spasticity along with weakness and lack of coordination result in gait abnormalities and functional limitations. Recent treatment option include neuromuscular electric stimulation (NMES), a form of therapy that applies electrical currents to produce contraction of innervated muscle by depolarizing local motor nerves. Currently, there are wide varieties of NMES devices available commercially for consumer.

The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a home-based NMES program on lower limb spasticity in patient with post-stroke more than 6 months and to assess the impact of the program. This is single arm prospective intervention study. Patient will apply home-based NMES on their leg for 20 minutes, 5 days a week for 4 weeks. At the end of the study, an outcome measures will be assessed and patient will be required to answer a questionnaires on their experience."

NCT02897791,"Main idea perception of written stories and in pictures among impaired right hemisphere patients Abstract The right hemisphere is considered to complement the language processing abilities of the opposite hemisphere; it is responsible for the processing of secondary and unusual characteristics of linguistic stimulates. This processing enables, among other functions, the comprehension of metaphors and humor. Additionally, it enables the execution of inferring from spoken and written discourse. Studies which deal with common impairments among right-hemisphere-damaged (RHD) individuals, found that inference processing of written stories and narrative sequences presented in pictures was impaired. This impairment could damage the ability to create global coherence, which is an important component of central theme comprehension of different types of narrative. Another important component is superstructures, schemas which aid creating, remembering and producing the main ideas of spoken and written discourse. Other studies consider impairment in creating global coherence, or Theory of Mind impairment, as the source of central theme comprehension impairment among RHD individuals.

Discourse is an integral part of interpersonal communication, and of proper social conduct. The themes chosen for conversation reflect the functional role of discourse from semantic and pragmatic points of view.

The aim of the current study is to deepen the current knowledge concerning central theme comprehension among RHD individuals following cerebrovascular accident (CVA), in two genres of written discourse (classic stories and stories with a twist), and in situations represented by single pictures. Unlike written stories, the extraction of the central theme out of a single picture requires focusing on a single situation and relying on non-linguistic visual information. Differences concerning central theme comprehension in the different discourse genres and in the pictures might be able to assist in selecting diagnostic and therapeutic tools designed to work on high cognitive-linguistic abilities, which are usually impaired among RHD individuals. In later stage, these tools are meant to help improving RHD individuals' spontaneous narrative skills.

The study will include 20 RHD adults following CVA, and 20 healthy adults without any known damage to the right hemisphere. The two groups will be matched concerning sex, age, educational level and socio-economic status. The subjects will perform the study tests during three sessions, 60 minutes each. The screening tests will include language diagnosis - Western Aphasia Battery (WAB), and reading test no. 37 included in the Psycholinguistic Assessments of Language Processing in Aphasia's battery (PALPA). Patients diagnosed with aphasia will be excluded from research. The research tests will include: central theme comprehension test in stories and pictures, including classic stories, stories with a twist, and pictures of different situations (each will be accompanied by a multiple-choice question concerning the central theme), sub- exanimations taken from ""Frigbi"" battery designed to evaluate memory and phonological memory capacity, Raven's Progressive Colored Matrices test designed to evaluate pre-morbid abilities (non-linguistic), Theory of Mind (T.O.M) evaluation test, and tests designed to evaluate central coherence impairment: Navon Figures test for evaluation of global visual perception impairment, and Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT) - Recall Form test for evaluation of visual-perceptive organizational ability, and non-verbal memory. The performances of the two groups will be compared in each test using statistical tests. In addition, the interaction between all variables will be measured."
NCT04892511,"Mechanical thrombectomy is a very effective treatment in patients who have suffered an acute ischemic stroke associated with intracranial large vessel occlusion. However, less than half of the patients achieve functional independence despite treatment. The optimization of blood pressure after mechanical thrombectomy based on the degree of recanalization achieved at the end of the procedure could improve the perfusion of the ischemic brain tissue thanks to the improvement of blood circulation provided by collateral circulation. For this, authorized hypotensive or hypertensive drugs will be used. Moreover, this individualized treatment would allow to decrease reperfusion injury and therefore decrease the risk of intracerebral bleeding complications and cerebral edema. Therefore, we designed a clinical trial in which the standard management of blood pressure after mechanical thrombectomy will be compared with a specific protocol in which blood pressure targets are applied according to the degree of recanalization obtained during the thrombectomy procedure. The beneficial effect and risk reduction of this treatment will translate into a better short and long-term outcome"

NCT04879615,"The development of intravenous thrombolysis has greatly improved the rate of recanalization and reperfusion in patients with acute ischemic stroke, increasing the proportion of patients with good outcome and reduced mortality. The guideline recommends that patients with ischemic stroke should be treated with intravenous thrombolysis within 4.5 hours. The latest meta-analysis found that ischemic stroke with onset time of 4.5-9 hours with infarction core volume <70ml, ischemic penumbra volume >10ml, and hypoperfusion volume / infarction core volume >1.2 could be benefit from intravenous thrombolysis. The DAWN clinical trial has shown that patients with ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion with onset time of 6-24 hours could be benefit from endovascular treatment after screening by multi-mode imaging. Therefore, we hypothesize that patients with ischemic stroke with onset time of 4.5-24 hours with a definite penumbra may also benefit from intravenous thrombolysis. The purpose of this study is to explore whether the patients with ischemic stroke with onset time of 4.5-24 hours can benefit from intravenous thrombolysis if they meet the standard of CT perfusion screening."
NCT05620966,"When an individual experiences a sudden onset of neurological symptoms, such as one-sided weakness, visual abnormalities, and/or slurred speech, there is concern that they are having a transient ischemic attack/stroke. A stroke is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment and further evaluation to prevent a future stroke. Unfortunately, when a patient presents to the emergency department or a clinic with transient or mildly observable neurological symptoms, it is difficult to diagnose a stroke and many times, imaging may not reveal a stroke. This poses the risk of discharging patients without appropriate stroke care. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of administering portable electroencephalogram (EEG) devices to diagnose transient ischemic attack/stroke. An EEG is a device that measures electrical activity in the brain. This study involves comparing EEG data of individuals who present with transient neurological symptoms or have known stroke with EEG data of generally healthy individuals. From this study, the investigators anticipate that it will be feasible to administer portable EEG and that portable EEG can be used to accurately diagnose stroke."

NCT03024190,"Poststroke spasticity (PSS) is one of the common complications in stroke patients who had a brain injury leading to limbs weakness and impaired coordination between agonist and antagonist contraction. PSS leads some physical impairments and functional deficits. The clinical managements for PSS are stretching and range of motion (ROM) exercises, antispasticity splint, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, oral medications, local injection with phenol or botulism, or surgery. Recently, some investigators tried to use Kinesiotaping (KT) for spasticity management or postural control. They found some benefits in walking ability and upper extremity function facilitation after stroke.

40 subacute stroke patients with hemiplegia would be enrolled in this study. These 40 patients will be randomly divided into the experimental and control groups. In experimental group (n=20), the patients will perform combined KT and 15- min stretching exercise for upper extremity twice daily and regular rehabilitation program for 3 weeks. In the control group (n=20), the patients will perform 15- min stretching exercise for upper extremity twice daily and regular rehabilitation program for 3 weeks.

NCT05419635,"Researchers are looking for a better way to prevent the formation of blood clots in people who have or have had:

an irregular and often rapid heartbeat
a blocked blood flow to the heart
a blocked or reduced blood flow to a part of the brain. When a blood clot forms in the body in patients with the above conditions, it may block vessels of the heart, the brain and/or other parts of the body. This may lead to heart attack, stroke and other serious complications.

Blood clots are formed in a process known as coagulation. This is a complex series of steps that must occur in a specific sequence. Medications are already available to prevent the formation of blood clots. They work by interrupting one or more of the coagulation steps and are therefore known as anticoagulants. They decrease the risk of the above-mentioned complications.

The study treatment asundexian works by blocking a very specific step in the blood clotting process, the activation of a protein called Factor XIa. Due to its very specific action that is not thought to be involved in the main blood clotting steps needed to stop bleeding (e.g. like from a cut finger), asundexian is expected to reduce the risk of bleeding that is still seen with existing anticoagulants. Since people who need an anticoagulant may also have liver problems, information on asundexian use in this group is needed.

The main purpose of this study is to learn how asundexian moves into, through and out of the body in participants with a mild or moderate reduction in liver function compared to participants with normal liver function who are similar in age, weight, and gender.

To answer this question, researchers will measure

the average highest level of asundexian in the blood (also referred to as Cmax)
the average total level of asundexian in the blood (also referred to as AUC). that were reached after intake of a single tablet of asundexian.

The researchers will compare these data between participants with reduced liver function and matched participants with normal liver function to look for differences.

Each participant will be in the study for up to 4 weeks. Participants will stay in-house for 6 days, starting the day before taking asundexian. In addition, two visits to the study site are planned.

During the study, the doctors and their study team will:

do physical examinations
check vital signs
take blood and urine samples
examine heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG)
ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.

An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatments."

NCT02882646,"In stroke rehabilitation, unilateral training of the impaired limb after stroke is often the frequent strategy used over bilateral ones. However, the clinical need for bilateral training is supported by evidence that shows that unilateral training of the impaired limb does not automatically restore bimanual coordination and function. Increased focused is needed on developing more robot-assisted therapy that can train the impaired arm bilaterally and unilaterally. Controlling these robots is often difficult and requires a better understanding of the coupling effects of the left and right hand before and after a stroke. There is a need to develop robot-assisted therapy devices that can address coupled and uncoupled bimanual movements as well as symmetry as well as asymmetry in context of human bimanual actions along with the intermanual division of labor in various ADL tasks. This study focuses on bilateral training and the use of bio-inspired control algorithms to understand impairment and recovery on Bimanual Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) by stroke subjects in terms of the arm kinematics. Healthy subjects and those with hemiplegia due to a stroke or cerebral palsy will be evaluated by a member of the research team and asked to perform a battery of tasks to test the viability and usability of a bilateral robot system called BiADLER, which allows patients to complete daily tasks with varying levels of assistance to adapt task performance to each individual subject's performance.

NCT03543319,"BACKGROUND: The cause of ischemic stroke remains undetermined in 30-40% of the cases, but circulating blood clots (thromboemboli) are a postulated common denominator in approx. 75% of patients. Transcranial Doppler monitoring (TCDM) is a non-invasive method of detecting circulating microemboli (CME) in the human cerebral circulation. The method is not used systematically in unselected groups of patients with repeated long-term registrations. New ultrasound equipment is ambulatory, less unpleasant for the patient and allows extended monitoring sessions. This may vastly simplify the implementation of TCDM as a clinically useful diagnostic tool.

AIMS: Determine the usefulness of TCDM in acute stroke diagnostics by assessing prevalence and frequency of CME in unselected patients with ischemic stroke, the influence of antithrombotic drugs on CME and the relationship between MES and recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).

HYPOTHESES: Prevalence and frequency of CME are higher during the first 24 hours than at later follow-up. Stroke etiology can be assessed by the presence or absence of CME. Presence of CME is associated with increased risk of recurrent TIA of stroke within 3 months and 1 year. Cessation of CME after the start of antithrombotic treatment is associated with reduced risk of recurrent TIA or stroke."
NCT05611242,The primary objective is to establish the efficacy of intra-arterial (IA) mechanical thrombectomy with proximal carotid artery angioplasty versus acute stenting during thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) from intracranial vessel occlusion (IVO) in the anterior circulation and have a proximal carotid occlusive disease (occlusion or severe stenosis) within 24 hours of symptom onset.
NCT03452254,"Stroke is one of the leading causes of serious long-term impairment. According to the estimates, 12,500 people suffer a new or recurrent ischemic stroke in Chile annually, which shows the magnitude of the problem. Motor impairment of the upper limb (UL) stands out as the principal sequel after a CVA (50% of the patients experience it), and the Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) is the rehabilitation approach that shows more scientific evidence today. Even though patients reach certain recuperation levels through this approach, results are still insufficient since 50-80% of the patients continue having upper limb motor impairment after completing standard rehabilitation. Because of this, it is pertinent to conduct research to explore new rehabilitation strategies to reduce the impairment indexes and to provide information for decision making based on evidence.

Recent studies on functional neuroimaging propose that there is an abnormal balance in the motor cortex excitability after stroke - relative under-excitability in the affected hemisphere and over-excitability in the unaffected hemisphere (with the consequent inhibitory influence on ipsilesional regions) in stroke patient with moderate motor impairment. This imbalance in the hemispheres function would limit the possibilities of a greater recovery. Then, in order to reestablish brain balance, the investigators proposed that the early introduction of noninvasive techniques of brain stimulation, such as tDCS, to the motor rehabilitation training could promote improvement of upper limb function in patients with stroke. However, we lack studies that confirm the benefits of using these techniques, define the most appropriate protocols, and determine what patients and under which evolving stages would be the best candidates for treatment.

This study aims to ""compare the effectiveness of seven days of bi-hemispheric tDCS, both active and sham, combined with modified CIMT (mCIMT) in the motor and functional recovery of the hemiparetic upper limb in hospitalized patients with subacute unihemispheric stroke at Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile and Hospital San José"". This comparison responds to the hypothesis that patients who receive bi-hemispheric and active tDCS combined with mCIMT (experimental group) get at least 30% more recovery of the paretic upper limb compared to the control group who receive sham bi-hemispheric tDCS plus mCIMT after a protocol of seven days treatment."

NCT05520034,"Stroke is a major public issue that can be occurred a patient with severe and unbearable disability for a long time. Recurrence of stroke is increasing due to a lack of knowledge and compliance with treatment regarding the modifiable risk factors of stroke and behavioral and lifestyle changes. Nurse-led health education with (self) monitoring of modifiable risk factors and behaviors can be an effective way to create knowledge about the behavioral changes in stroke patients.

NCT03003871,"Stroke is the second most common cause of death worldwide and is the predominant cause of permanent disability among older people. The mouth becomes a very unhealthy place after stroke, where yeasts and pathogenic bacteria multiply at an accelerated rate. Poor oral hygiene results in increased dental plaque, gingival bleeding, and the harbouring of oral opportunistic pathogens. Dental plaque acts as a reservoir of pathogenic microorganisms which results in additional oral health problems and also can cause life-threatening medical complications; most notably aspiration pneumonia and/or recurrent stroke. The first six months following stroke is a particular vulnerable period to survive.

Removal of dental plaque and its associated pathogenic microorganisms is challenging in this compromised state of reduced manual dexterity and weak state following a stroke. Powered (electric) toothbrushes can be of assistance in plaque removal in frail elders. For more resistant oral pathogens, anti-plaque/anti-microbial mouthrinses can offer additional help in controlling dental plaque and thereby prevent harbouring potentially life threatening oral pathogens. Over the years the Faculty of Dentistry and the Stroke Rehabilitation Unit of the Department of Medicine in Hong Kong have been actively working together to address the problems of oral health associated with stroke; and specifically the challenge of safeguarding the life and health of stroke survivors during the vulnerable rehabilitation period. We are now proposing to involve stroke patients during out-patient rehabilitation in a randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of powered tooth brushing and a chlorhexidine anti-microbial mouthrinse in reducing dental plaque accumulation and oral pathogens; and how this affects their general and oral health status. We anticipate that all participants will benefit from the oral health promotion initiatives and that the advantages will be long lasting. We expect to demonstrate a 'gold standard' of oral health preventive care, as part of stroke rehabilitation, that can reduce (or has potential to reduce) serious medical complications after a stroke. If proven effective this oral health preventive care regime (which is relatively easy to implement and at low cost) could widely be adopted in stroke rehabilitation globally."

NCT02964052,"Use of intravenous (IV) thrombolysis and intra-arterial (IA) recanalization treatment has been rapidly increasing, However, despite of the treatment, recanalization rates are 22.6 - 70% and only 30-50% of patients show meaningful clinical improvements. Mechanisms of futile recanalization may include 1) large ischemic core, 2) poor collateral, and 3) presence of comorbidity. In this regards, developing selection criteria using acute stroke imaging and comorbidity is warranted.

Investigators will recruit the consecutive acute stroke patients who received IV thrombolysis and/or IA recanalization treatment. This study will perform with prospective design to develop CT-based clot, core and collateral scores and a comorbidity index for selecting stroke patients who are at high risks by the treatment. Investigators will firstly establish the CT-based scores and comorbidity index using a pre-existing cohort database. Using these CT-based and comorbidity index, Investigators will validate them in a multi-center prospectively cohort. In addition, Investigators will assess the cost-effectiveness of selecting patients based on the comorbidity index."

NCT03349411,"The goal of this study is to understand what brain mechanisms become disrupted when stroke survivors experience delirium. Delirium is an acute reduction in attention and cognition, associated with poor recovery, longer hospitalization and even death. One major factor increasing the risk of delirium after stroke may be spatial neglect occurring after stroke on the right side of the brain. Spatial neglect affects awareness, orientation, and movement. The study will test the hypothesis that the right-dominant brain networks for arousal and attention are affected in both of these disorders. It is expected that the activity and structural integrity of these brain networks will correlate with behavioral signs and severity of delirium and spatial neglect. To test this hypothesis, the study will measure spatial neglect and delirium symptoms in 45 acute (NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue ) and 30 subacute (Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation) stroke survivors and evaluate brain scans for these participants. This study may contribute to knowledge about brain bio-markers of delirium, which will greatly aid in delirium detection in stroke and other disorders."

Depression is the second risk factor for stroke as tobacco smoking following hypertension. Peripheral abnormalities in serotonin parameters were described in depression and tobacco smoking. The investigators hypothesized dysregulations in pathways of serotonin (5-HT), which has notably complex vasomotor effects and of kynurenine which could have cognitive dysfunction effects.

The aim of this study is to evaluate simultaneously the involvement of serotonin and kynurenine pathways parameters in patients suffering from a cerebral infarction shortly after the onset (less than 4 hours and a half), within a 2 days follow-up (Day 1 and Day 2) and 3 months after the cerebral infarction."
NCT02948465,"Cerebral infarcts represent a major cause of morbidity/mortality in spite of therapeutics for a premature recanalisation (intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and thrombectomy). Thrombolysis failure by the administration of rt-PA is frequent, in particular in proximal occlusion. Experimental studies suggest that neutrophils could play an important role in the thrombus development via the organization of a network (NET) within the thrombus. Targeting this network of NET could, in addition to the fibrinolysis, increase the rate of recanalisation and thus improve the neurological prognostic after a cerebral infarct.

NCT02928926,"Cerebral autoregulation is an important mechanism whereby cerebral perfusion is normally maintained at a constant level, over a relatively wide blood pressure range. It can be assessed noninvasively by the use of Trans Cranial Doppler (TCD). This means using ultrasound probes over both sides of the head to measure changes in blood flow in one of the main brain arteries (the middle cerebral artery) in response to beat to beat changes in blood pressure dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA). It is established that dCA is impaired following moderate to severe stroke, acting as a key role in the development of secondary brain damage related to brain swelling and further damage related to low blood flow. The administration of clotbusting therapy (thrombolysis), one of the main approved treatments of acute ischaemic stroke (AIS), results in recanalization of the blocked artery in over approximately 50% patients. However, due to its clot dissolving property, it may increase the risk of bleeding in the body, especially in the brain, leading to greater disability or even death. To date, there has been very little information regarding the natural history and prognostic significance of impaired Cerebral Autoregulation during and following reperfusion, especially those who receive thrombolysis. This research will use the noninvasive technique of Trans Cranial Doppler (TCD) to see how blood flow changes in AIS patient at the initiation and completion of thrombolysis, and during acute, subacute and chronic phase post stroke onset, compared with those AIS patient who did not receive thrombolysis. This study will provide important data regarding perithrombolysis blood pressure management, an important and common clinical dilemma"

Task-specific training has shown to be an effective intervention to improve mobility in individuals with stroke, however, little is known about the impact of this intervention on levels of physical activity. The main objective will be to investigate the efficacy of a task-specific training, focused on both upper and lower limbs, in improving physical activity levels and mobility in individuals with stroke. The secondary objective will be to investigate the effect of the training, in improving muscle strength, exercise capacity, and quality of life. A randomized controlled trial with blinded assessment will assign eligible participants to either: 1) experimental group or 2) control group. Participants will receive interventions three times per week over 12 weeks. The experimental group will undertake task-specific training, while the control group will undertake global stretching and memory exercises, and health education sessions. Primary outcomes will include measures of physical activity levels and mobility, whereas secondary outcomes will be muscle strength, exercise capacity, and quality of life. The outcomes will be measured at baseline, 12 weeks post-intervention, and four and 12 weeks follow-up.

NCT04282330,"CEST in Stroke is an observational magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study in acute ischaemic stroke patients. Ischaemic stokes are the most common type of stroke and occur when a blood clot blocks the flow of blood and oxygen your brain needs. This can lead to cellular death (infarction) so the quicker a stroke is diagnosed and treated, the better a patient's recovery is likely to be.

The purpose of this study is to determine the technical feasibility of a new MRI technique known as Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) imaging for assessing the extent of potentially salvageable brain tissue (penumbra) around an area of infarction. CEST imaging works by looking at the chemicals in the brain cells. The chemicals may change when cells are affected by stroke. Stroke patients are not normally treated with with clotbusting drugs or clot-retrieving devices if they arrive at hospital many hours after the stroke because treatment may not help and in some cases it may cause more harm than good. However, the new MRI technique could detect those stroke patients who arrive at hospital many hours after the stroke but still have salvageable brain - in these cases it would be helpful to treat these patients and therefore stop those cells from dying.

However, there are several technical issues that need to be addressed before CEST can be adopted as a routine clinical assessment. CEST in Stroke hopes to address these issues by using an alternate MRI sequence capable of acquiring CEST data over a large portion of the brain in approximately in 10 minutes.

The overall aim of study is to determine the feasibility of CEST imaging for assessing the extent of penumbra, in order to determine which patients may benefit from re-perfusion interventions who would otherwise not be eligible. If the study is successful, further research will be implemented to help clinical decision making in stroke patients who present outside of conventional time windows."

NCT04844476,"Some stroke survivors develop a fear of falling(FoF) which may exist with or without a prior fall. Fear of fall can be defined as decreased perceived self efficacy or confidence in maintaining balance while completing regular activities. FoF may impair rehabilitation and recovery. Determination of FoF related factors will help to identify interventions needed to decrease FoF. Mostly fear of fall related factors have been studied in acute stroke patients, limited data are available for patients with chronic stroke. The objective of this study is to evaluate frequency of FoF in chronic(>6 months) stroke patients and investigate relationship between FoF and balance, posture,spasticity and activities of daily living. The Turkish Version of the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale was used to measure FoF. Also a single-item dichotomous question ""Are you afraid of falling? (Yes/No)"" will be asked."
NCT03584477,"Hemiparesis is the most common motor disorder after a stroke. Most patients do not recover functional use of their paretic upper limb.

The use of robotic assistance provides intensive motor training through a large number of repetitive movements, usually oriented and interactive tasks (pointing tasks, tracking paths tasks...). These feature have been demonstrated to be critical to stimulate brain plasticity after a brain damage. The InMotion Arm 2.0 manipulator works with an adaptive algorithm that provide patients with real-time Assistance-as-Needed™ desgned to enhance motor performance.

Hypothesis: In the sub-acute phase of stroke, the structured practice of a large number of repeated movements will increase motor function of the upper limb compared to conventional rehabilitation. Secondly, this practice will be more effective in a free active mode (without assistance) than an active assisted mode (Assistance-as-Needed™).

Expected secondary benefits: Subjective impression of improved use of the upper limb in activities of daily living and reduction of spastic cocontractions affecting the agonist and antagonist muscles during movements of the upper limb.

Objectives: This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of structured repetition programs of arm movements, on the function of the hemiparetic upper limb and motor control, between 4 and 10 weeks after the stroke, using a robotic device with or without assistance in partial substitution of conventional rehabilitation care, compared to a program with conventional care alone."
NCT05448261,"Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability globally. Stroke survivors generally require lifelong support from family caregivers. The abrupt onset of stroke and associated physical and cognitive impairments result in a series of complex and demanding interactions between family caregivers and stroke survivors. More than 40% of stroke caregivers develop depressive symptoms over time. The depression of family caregivers negatively impacts their physical health and caregiving role and directly affects the mental health and recovery of stroke survivors. Thus, effective strategies for stressful caregiving situations are urgently needed.

As postulated in the relational/problem solving model of stress, problem-solving coping is a cognitive behavioral process that can enhance caregivers' well-being by changing caregiving situations and/or changing their negative emotional stress responses to stressful situations into positive responses. In view of the influence of negative emotions on the cognitive process of an individual, integrating perspective taking as a cognitive reappraisal strategy into the training of problem-solving coping skills may potentially improve the psychosocial well-being of family caregivers.

This mixed method study aims (1) to examine the effects of a emotion-centered problem-solving intervention on the depressive symptoms, problem-solving coping, emotion regulation, caregiving competence, and health-related quality of life of stroke caregivers and on the physical functioning of stroke survivors; (2) to explore the mediating effect of emotion regulation and problem solving coping on caregivers' depressive symptoms, caregiving competence, and health-related quality of life and on stroke survivors' physical functioning; and (3) to understand how intervention influences depressive symptoms from a family caregiver's perspective. A total of 178 family caregivers will be recruited from various non-government organizations and nurse clinics for stroke patients of the Hospital Authority. Participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention group (IG) and control group (CG). Caregivers in the IG will receive an emotion-centered problem-solving intervention adopting a ""shared problem, shared action plan"" approach, whereas the caregivers in the CG will receive stroke-related education. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 12 and 36 weeks after study entry.

This study makes the first attempt to develop an emotion-centered problem-solving intervention and examine its effectiveness in the context of stroke caregiving. The findings will advance our understanding of emotional regulation and problem-solving coping strategies for reducing the depressive symptoms of stroke caregivers, ultimately providing a culturally sensitive medical-social service direction for the delivery of community-based rehabilitation services to stroke families."

NCT05370274,"Following a stroke, individuals experience pain in the affected upper limb (UL) and residual weakness in the UL, which impacts their quality of life and performance of activities of daily living. To overcome these deficits, exercises are a key element to any rehabilitation program and are based on the reorganization capacity of the central nervous system (called neuroplasticity). To optimize the beneficial effects of exercises and potentiate neuroplasticity, non-invasive brain stimulation devices (NIBS) are increasingly used as a complementary therapy post stroke. Among NIBS, a new technique, called cranial nerve non-invasive neuromodulation (CN-NINM), is making its way into stroke rehabilitation since, unlike other NIBS such as tDCS, it allows the generation of a direct flow of neuronal impulses via the stimulation of the tongue. The goal of this project is therefore to investigate CN-NINM to document its feasibility and explore its efficacy at improving motor recovery and reduce pain at the affected UL in chronic stroke patients (> 6 months). CN-NINM will be applied for 20 minutes during each exercise session of the UL (3X/week, 4 weeks). Feasibility data will comprise adherence to CN-NINM, drop out rate and adverse events and UL motor recovery and pain will be assessed before and after the exercise program. At the end of this study, it is expected that it will be feasible to use CN-NINM as an intervention in combination with the exercise program and that it will result in improved motor function and reduced pain in affected UL."

NCT04877444,"Stroke is a leading cause of disability in the U.S. and many Veteran stroke survivors live with severe disability. Despite recent advances in rehabilitation treatments many stroke survivors have persistent physical and mental difficulties such as reduced physical and cognitive function and depression. Developing innovative treatments that address these problems is necessary to improve long-term outcomes for stroke survivors. Aerobic exercise (AEx) can improve physical and cognitive function, and reduce depression. Additionally, AEx may enhance physical rehabilitation by making the brain more receptive to, and consequently improving the response to an intervention. Therefore, combining AEx with physical rehabilitation has the potential to improve multiple aspects of stroke recovery. This study will examine the effect of combining AEx with physical rehabilitation on physical and mental function in stroke survivors. By gaining a better understanding of the effects of this combined intervention the investigators aim to advance the rehabilitative care of Veteran stroke survivors."

NCT04808258,"Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is recommended in patients with ischemic stroke when cardiac etiology is suspected to help plan secondary stroke management. However, discrepancy for specific clinical recommendation exists between cardiologists and neurologists, and data evaluating usefulness of TTE in unselected patients with cryptogenic strokes (CS) and embolic strokes of undetermined source (ESUS) are lacking. The investigators sought to evaluate the value of routinely performed echocardiography in consecutive CS/ESUS patients. The investigators will perform TTE as recommended by guidelines including agitated saline contrast and speckle-tracking to investigate potential implications for secondary stroke management. In addition, the researchers aim to evaluate the effectiveness of long-term continuous electrocardiogram (cECG) monitorering with newer Holter monitors to detect cardiac arrhythmia in patients with CS/ESUS.

In this prospective study, the investigators aim to evaluate 500 consecutive patients, regardless of age, in sinus rhythm with acute IS and potential cardioembolic stroke (CES) or cryptogenic stroke (CS/ESUS) according to Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria. Strokes are determined by magnetic resonance imaging. The researchers will perform TTE as recommended by guidelines including agitated saline contrast and speckle-tracking to investigate potential implications for secondary stroke management.

The investigators aim to explore underlying heart conditions and comorbidities among CES and ESUS patients. Data will include left atrium morphology, atrial septal aneurysm, valvular disease, mural thrombus and patent foramen ovale (PFO). Focus will be analysis of data on older patients, as some studies indicate that in ESUS patients >60 years of age, there is a higher prevalence of PFO in patients with low atherosclerosis and cardioembolic risk.

NCT02868723,"This will be a prospective randomized 2 year study of patients admitted to the Hamad General Hospital (HGH) and the Stroke Prevention Clinic with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke (IS) and Transit ischemic attacks (TIAs). After signing of the informed consent forms and initial evaluation and investigations, all patients enrolled in the two arms ( study arm and control arm) of the study will be followed for one year (monthly visits for the first three months followed by visits three months until completion of study: total of 6 follow up visits) and the pre-specified investigations repeated at the one year follow up. In one arm (the control group), the patients will be offered best risk factor management strategies as currently being practiced by stroke specialists at HGH in Qatar. And in the second ( the subject group) arm, with assistance of a nurse-practitioner and pharmacist, the investigators will make aggressive attempts to meet ""to target"" defined risk factors and have the evaluations and investigations completed as in the initial year cohort. All patients will have risk factor stratification according the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and the change in score measured over time.The primary objective will be to determine if an approach that utilizes a comprehensive strategy results in a significantly outcome. A clinically 'meaningful' difference in the blood pressure (BP) and lipid control of 10% between the aggressively managed versus patients treated with the standard of care will require minimum of 200 patients in each group (alpha error set at 0.05 and beta error at 0.20, power 80%) to be recruited over 1 year and followed for one year (total study duration 2 years).

All patients will have screening magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (including gradient echo (GRE) sequence), carotid 3D Doppler measurement of plaque volume, and PAD assessments, C-reactive protein (CRP) and evaluation for protein urea at baseline. These studies will be repeated in 1 year at the time of exit from the study. The co-primary objective would be to monitor progression (or regression) of plaque build-up on 3D Doppler imaging of the carotid arteries between the two cohorts. The investigators hypothesize that aggressive management of vascular risk factors to ""recommended target levels"" will lead to better vascular health. Compared to current practice, comprehensive and coordinated approach at preventive measures will lead to more patients with better control of blood pressure and lipid levels. Improved risk factor management will result in slowing of atherosclerosis and its downstream effects which will be measurable on sophisticated blood and imaging testing. Clinically this will translate into fewer hospital re-admissions."

NCT04795687,"The composition of the intestinal microbiota is associated with the risk of stroke and with post-stroke neurological evolution. At the same time, the genetics and epigenetics of each patient are associated with the composition of the intestinal microbiota. The study of the microbiome in stroke patients will allow finding new therapeutic targets for the treatment of stroke patients.

For the study, samples will be collected from those patients with ischemic stroke who come to the hospital while the study is being carried out, taking into account certain criteria: the patients must be over 18 years of age, have suffered an ischemic stroke (demonstrated by resonance or head CT), not have any additional serious illness or unstable medical condition, and not be included in clinical trials with neuroprotective drugs. On the other hand, the control group will be asymptomatic, and will be made up of people who have not previously suffered a stroke or a cardiovascular event and who do not have diseases that affect the digestive tract.

The main variables of the study are the risk of stroke and disability after a cerebrovascular accident (measured by mRS at 3rd month). Microbiota, genetic and epigenetic variables are also taken into account, such as the presence and levels of bacteria, dysbiosis, genetic polymorphisms and levels of methylation in CpG islands."
NCT02846363,"Acute stroke management represents a true medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and urgent treatment. In a previous exhaustive cohort study conducted in the Rhône region, France (AVC69) the investigators observed that only a small percentage of patients could access to thrombolysis in time. In this cohort of 1306 patients treated in one of the emergency department of the Rhone region for a suspected stroke, 84% of patients reached hospital through an emergency department instead of going directly to a stroke unit. Among those patients, only 8% were finally thrombolysed, because of extended management times.. Our hypothesis was that public awareness campaign designed to improve public's knowledge and skills would consequently reduce prehospital time and favour call to prehospital emergency medical services (EMS).

The investigators will conduct an awareness campaign aimed at the general population, using different communication media, the content will be developed based on the results of a qualitative study with focus groups (Quali-AVC), and using a diffusion plan established with communications professionals. To assess the effects of this campaign, a comparative quasi-experimental before-after study will be conducted. A control region where no awareness stroke program has been set up has been selected, data will be collected in the two regions. The assessment of the impact of the campaign will focus on the comparison of the evolution of indicators between these two regions. Three assessment time will be provided: before starting the program, at 3 months and at the end of the program."

NCT02833961,"Cerebral vascular disorder is one of the most fatal diseases despite current advances in medical science. The large number of negative clinical trials on neuroprotection in acute stroke is a pointer to the fact that translating better understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology to clearly beneficial treatment strategies remains a daunting task. This project aims at elucidating the plausible biophysical events that affect water and metabolite diffusion in brain tissue after ischemia, by combining the information provided by two advanced methods of magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion imaging: diffusional kurtosis imaging and diffusion-weighted spectroscopy.

Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) has been established as a major tool for the early detection of stroke. However, information obtained using conventional DWI may be incomplete. Diffusional kurtosis (K) is a quantitative measure of the complexity or heterogeneity of the microenvironment in white and grey matter, which offers complementary information and may potentially be a more sensitive biomarker for probing pathophysiological changes. In addition, to gain more specific insights into molecular mobility in the intracellular environment, it is beneficial to assess the diffusion properties of metabolites, such as N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr), and choline containing compounds (Cho). Assessment of metabolite diffusion changes by diffusion-weighted spectroscopy (DWS) provides information specific to the intracellular environment. In particular, thanks to the specific compartmentation of NAA almost exclusively in neurons and of Cho in glial cells, the diffusion properties of these metabolites may provide specific insights into the pathological processes occurring independently in the two cell types. In addition, measuring a temporal profile of diffusion coefficient of these compounds may help clarify underlying pathophysiological changes in neuronal cells during acute ischemia.

With the help of these two advanced methods, a proof-of-concept trial is proposed on 24 healthy subjects and 24 ischemic stroke patients. Ischemic stroke patients will be scanned three times with a 3T MR scanner (before day 10 post-stroke, around week 4 and 3 months), in order to extract diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and DWS metrics and understand the dynamics of the cellular mechanisms at play in cerebral ischemia. The goal of this study is to investigate neuronal and glial metabolite diffusion changes at different time points after ischemic stroke, in both infarcted and non-infarcted hemispheres. The aim is to get non-invasively important information on the evolution of the cellular damage in this disease, and possibly distinguishing between neuronal and glial processes (by measuring the metrics extracted for these two sequences), as well as on the different mechanisms leading to metabolite diffusion changes in the two brain areas, thus providing a great impact on the strategy of treatment for patients with cerebral infarction."
NCT02834273,"The rapid diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke are critical in the reduction of morbidity, disability and stroke associated mortality Under-education about stroke may prevent people from recognizing symptoms early enough to seek immediate care.

The studies reported on stroke patients managed in stroke center have shown that 39-42% of patients could not name any symptoms of stroke and 36% to 43% no risk factor of stroke.

The stroke patients are therefore a population at high risk for neurological events and cardiac vascular recurrence. However, no studies have evaluated the interest of the development of therapeutic workshops in stroke unit to educate patients about symptoms suggestive of stroke, risk factors and what to do in cases of stroke.

Investigators assume that the setting up of a therapeutic education workshop in the stroke unit may allow a better understanding of the symptoms, risk factors and what to do following stroke. So there is a direct benefit to the patient represented by a better knowledge of stroke (warning signs, risk factors, what to do), improved treatment compliance and reduced risk of recurrence.

More generally, there is a real benefit to promote these messages to the public through the patient and his relatives"

NCT02814760,"Acute stroke management represents a true medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and urgent treatment. In a previous exhaustive cohort study conducted in the Rhône region, France (AVC69) (Porthault et al. 2013) the investigators observed that only a small percentage of patients could access to thrombolysis in time. In this cohort of 1306 patients treated in one of the emergency department of the Rhone region for a suspected stroke, 84% of patients reached hospital through an emergency department instead of going directly to a stroke unit. Among those patients, only 2% were finally thrombolysed. A significant part of patients arrived in the emergency department too late to be thrombolysed. However, among the subset of ischemic stroke patients who reach emergency department less than 3 hours after symptoms onset, and who had no clinical or radiological exclusion criteria for thrombolysis, only 15 % were thrombolysed. The hypothesis was that an intervention designed to improve ED professional's knowledge and skills and to develop together efficient clinical pathway would decrease door-to imaging time and consequently door-to needle time and eventually improve overall thrombolysis rate.

The investigators have conducted a cluster randomized controlled stepped wedge trial. All adult patients with suspected stroke arriving in one of the participating ED were included in the study along five successive four-month periods. The program featured: development of written materials (booklets) and video (film), and one day session of standardized training for trainers, at least one nurse and one physician of all EDs, with formal presentation to improve knowledge, and simulation to improve skills for using the ""FAST"" tool (nurses) and the ""NIHSS"" score (ED physicians).

Therefore, the primary objective will be to investigate the effects of aerobic treadmill training on physical activity levels and sedentary behavior in subjects post-stroke. The secondary aim will be to investigate the effects of the training on cardiorespiratory fitness, endurance, depression, mobility, quality of life, and participation.

A randomized controlled trial with blinded assessment will assign eligible participants to either: 1) aerobic treadmill training (experimental group, at 60-80% of heart rate reserve), or 2) overground walking (control group, below 40% of heart rate reserve). Both groups will receive 40-minute training sessions three times/week over 12-weeks, in groups of 2-4 participants, by a trained physiotherapist. Primary outcomes: physical activity levels and sedentary behavior (Multisensor SenseWear Mini® and Human Activity Profile). Secondary outcomes: cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) and ventilatory threshold), endurance, depression, mobility, quality of life, and participation. The effects of the trainings will be analyzed from the collected data and intention-to-treat analysis. Between-groups differences will be measured by two-way ANOVA with repeated measures considering the baseline, post-training, and a 4-week follow-up.

NCT02779712,"Stroke has an enormous impact on both individual and society. Novel treatments are required to relieve this burden and remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is one such approach. RIC refers to applying non-lethal ischaemia to an area distant from an organ you are trying to protect (e.g. the brain). Pre-clinical animal stroke studies have shown RIC to be neuroprotective and help restore functional outcome when compared to control. These outcomes are achieved simply by transiently occluding the blood supply to a limb (e.g. the arm) very soon after the stroke occurs. The mechanisms of protection are unclear but may be due enhancing the body's ability to protect itself from further injury by favorably altering cerebral blood flow or reducing the detrimental effects of oxygen free radicals. Ischaemic conditioning (IC) is an intervention already applied during cardiac surgery to protect the heart from damage and it may be effective after an acute myocardial infarction. The investigators therefore plan to conduct a pilot randomised controlled trial assessing the feasibility of applying RIC (4 cycles of blood pressure cuff inflation for 5 minutes) in patients within 6 hours of ischaemic stroke. The primary outcome is feasibility of RIC. Secondary outcomes include tolerability, safety and clinical efficacy. The results will inform the design of future trials of a potential intervention is that is pragmatic, non-invasive and simple to administer."

NCT03228979,"Recurrent stroke, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are important causes of poor outcome in patients with index stroke. According to the INTERSTROKE study, 80% of stroke are preventable due to the presence of modifiable risk factors. However, the lack of knowledge that stroke and cardiovascular diseases are preventable is a major hurdle to reduce the incidence of recurrent stroke and cardiovascular morbidity. This is further compounded by the non-compliance to medications, exercises smoking cessation and other lifestyle modifications.

Stroke awareness has proven to be useful in improving the early arrival of stroke patients to emergency thus increasing the thrombolysis rates. Early stroke prevention education using print and audio-visual media may be useful. In addition, the use of pervasive mobile phone platform may help us reach patients during multiple intervals in a timely manner.

NCT02778334,"Introduction and literature review With 130 000 cases per year in France in 2010, stroke is one of the most common neurological diseases, often leaving many disabling sequelae physical and cognitive levels (currently live 500 000 disabled following a stroke) and leading and a loss of significant autonomy in these patients. However, many stroke survivors soon find a range comparable to their previous state. Investigators can then ask ourselves about the impact of this life event in these people who apparently do not show visible effects: what about the psychological repercussions of stroke in these patients healthy; what is changed in their daily lives, particularly in their mental functioning after this brutal confrontation with their own mortality?

Objectives Our project aims to better understand the psychological repercussions of stroke in patients who quickly find a health and autonomy comparable to their previous state. The objective will be to investigate the relationship between depressive symptoms and anxiety, coping strategies and quality of life from the acute phase and during the first months after the onset of stroke. This period is particularly demanding for these patients must therefore adapt and readjust continuously: shock stroke, hospitalization in several services (intensive care, neurology, rehabilitation), back home, ""new"" life with the changes related stroke, resumption of a professional activity, etc ...

Our methodology will combine tools conventionally used (standardized interview, validated questionnaires) to newer, ecological and true methods (Experience Sampling Method applied by the use of a smarphone application) to assess different variables studied.

This initially be determined whether the various symptoms of the depression on the one hand and anxiety on the other hand, depending on their mode of expression (vs. outsourced internalized; ie emotional, cognitive, somatic), observed from the acute phase of stroke, are related and predict the quality of life, depression and anxiety in the longer term (four months after the stroke).

Furthermore, our study will observe if the individual coping strategies (coping) daily and evolution influence the psychological status and quality of life during the months following the stroke."

NCT05479903,"Stroke is currently the most common disabling disease, which often leads to impairment of sensory, motor, speech and psychological functions, resulting in a reduced quality of life for patients. Therefore, post-stroke functional rehabilitation, especially the rehabilitation of physical function and psychological condition, is particularly important for patients to rejoin society. Acupuncture can promote the functional recovery of patients and facilitate the rehabilitation of limb function, thus improving the quality of survival of post-stroke patients.

Neurotrophic factors are diverse, most of which are mainly derived from neuronal cells in the central nervous system and are involved in a variety of neurological functions such as cell growth, differentiation and plasticity, thus promoting recovery of multiple functions after stroke. Many studies have found that different interventions affect the prognosis of stroke patients differently, e.g., long-term acupuncture increases serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in stroke patients and also has better outcomes than controls in post-stroke neurological recovery and the development of post-stroke psychiatric disorders.

This study investigated the effects of different therapeutic measures on patients' functional recovery and neurotrophic factors by setting up a controlled and blinded trial design, which could not only provide clinical evidence for the effectiveness of relevant therapeutic measures, but also verify the clinical value of certain neurotrophic factors (e.g., predicting outcome, assessing condition, and preventing adverse events)."

NCT05320263,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with basilar artery occlusion (BAO) present a devastating, life-threatening prognosis.

Urgent recanalization with endovascular mechanical thrombectomy is routinely performed in patients with BAO although the level of evidence is lower than that in anterior circulation occlusions (randomization in this population versus medical treatment alone having been impossible in recent studies). Recently, a large retrospective study supports the interest of thrombectomy in this population .

Speed and grade of the recanalisation have a major impact on clinical outcome. Favorable outcome at 90 days is strongly associated with the successful recanalization status at the end of the endovascular procedure (OR=4.57, 95%CI=1.24-16.87, P=0.023).

First pass effect has been shown to be a strong marker of efficacy of endovascular procedure with significant correlation with clinical outcome.

Thrombectomy with Stent retrievers dramatically changed the prognosis of anterior circulation large vessel occlusion strokes and currently used in BAO patients (posterior circulation). Contact aspiration (CA) is currently used in anterior large vessel occlusions (COMPASS trial, Lancet 2019), with similar rates of recanalization and favorable outcomes (Boulanger M, 2019), as well as in BAO patients .

However, the benefit of CA compared to SR for the treatment of BAO remains under debate with the superiority of first line CA compared to SR or no difference. Available data are based on retrospective studies with no data from RCT.

In this context, a randomized controlled trial is needed to assess the benefit of CA versus SR."

NCT05283369,"The use of interactive applications associated with movement sensors has begun to spread as an option for the reinforcement of physical rehabilitation therapies in patients with acquired motor disabilities as a consequence of some neurological damage, due to their portability and the relative autonomy that they grant to the patient. However, the results of its effectiveness and impact continue to be discreet compared to traditional therapy. The present study aims to explore possible changes in motor function and in the brain's functional connectivity through resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI), for subacute ischemic stroke outpatients, associated with occupational therapy using interactive applications as a therapeutic complement, comparing with patients on conventional therapy, for which a randomized pilot study with an experimental group and a matched control group will be carried out. The intervention will consist of the application of a virtual rehabilitation program in addition to physical therapy for the experimental group, while the control group will receive conventional physical therapy. Before and after the said intervention, standardized tests will be applied to evaluate the mobility, motor function, and cognitive impairment of the participants. The results obtained will be subject to statistical analysis."

NCT05282290,"Ischemic stroke accounts for 80% of all strokes and there is a lack of effective treatment options.Mechanical thrombectomy can significantly improve the vascular recanalization rate and reduce the disability rate of stroke, but the problem of reperfusion injury caused by vascular recanalization is more prominent than before.

The most common manifestation of reperfusion injury is postoperative hemorrhage transformation in the infarct area, which is caused by the inability of blood vessels to tolerate normal perfusion pressure after endothelial cell injury.Therefore, in addition to using necessary strategies to reduce the risk of bleeding before and during surgery, maintaining an appropriate and individualized perfusion pressure after surgery is also an important strategy to prevent and treat postoperative bleeding.

Lead a multicenter, randomized, controlled study looking at Individuation lowers blood pressure.( Drop systolic blood pressure to 90-110mmHg，Blood pressure not lower than 90/60 mm Hg，The reduced blood pressure was maintained for 48 hours). Influence of the incidence of hemorrhage transformation caused by reperfusion injury after mechanical thrombectomy and prognosis (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score and proportion of patients with mRS≤2) at 48hours, 14 and 90 days after surgery.Thus, provide clinical evidence for blood pressure management strategy after mechanical thrombectomy."

NCT05231694,"Ischemic stroke is a common clinical disease, often accompanied by motor dysfunction and cognitive impairment. At present, clinical treatment for patients with ischemic stroke recovery is limited and ineffective. The emergence of NGF has surprised the field of neurorehabilitation, but the clinical effect is not satisfactory. The main problem is that NGF is a macromolecular material with a molecular weight of 13.4 KD, which is difficult to penetrate the blood brain barrier. A large number of previous studies in our team have found that electroacupuncture with specific stimulation mode can open the blood brain barrier and induce NGF into the brain。Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of specific stimulation mode electroacupuncture combined with NGF treatment together with rehabilitation training on patients with ischemic stroke recovery period and to explore the mechanism of this combination therapy to improve brain function, which creates a new method and theoretical basis for nerve rehabilitation of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine."

NCT04944680,"The injury and remodeling mechanism about upper extremity motor network after stroke is not clear. There are few studies on the motor network covering cortex, white matter and blood perfusion at the time. Some studies have shown that metal imagery activates the cortex through active mental simulation. Our previous study has shown that passive application of transcranial direct current stimulation causes subthreshold polarization and promotes the effective integration of residual brain high-level network. This study proposes a hypothesis: transcranial Direct Current Stimulation + Motor Imagery combines active and passive neuromodulation techniques to produce dual channel effect, which can synergistically excite motor cortex, remodel the motor network and optimize cerebral perfusion. The research contents include clarify the effect of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation + Motor Imagery neuromodulation therapy through comprehensive randomized controlled trial study; present the process of brain injury and secondary neural plasticity through the motor network construction, functional connectivity strength and cerebral perfusion with Blood Oxygen Level Dependent, Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Arterial Spin Labeling multimodal magnetic resonance technology; calculate the correlation between motor score and brain functional network, extract the key nodes that can promote the motor network remodeling.

NCT04864470,"There are over 1.2 million stroke survivors in the UK and annual costs of stroke care to the NHS will treble from £3.4 billion in 2015 to £10.2 billion in 2035. More than 60% of stroke survivors leave hospital with a disability, and half experience depression within the first five years. Emotional, social and psychological needs are common, often compounded by patients' perceptions of 'abandonment' when rehabilitation ends.

Currently there is a gap between the social, emotional and physical needs of stroke survivors and the availability and suitability of long-term recovery and rehabilitation services. In 2018, a commissioned survey by the Stroke Association found 50% of stroke survivors and 85% of carers felt they needed more support than currently exists.

Stroke Odysseys - the performance art programme- provides an opportunity for communication of experiences of stroke to an audience through acquired skills in movement, music, song and the spoken word. The performance arts courses delivered by Rosetta Life for stroke survivors have been evaluated in previous studies and have shown that engagement in and learning about performance skills can have a positive impact on perceptions of disability, improve cognition, mobility and speech disabilities among a stroke community that can be stigmatised by the public perception of disabling illness.

The Stroke Odysseys programme will be scaled up to a large number of participants with the aim to evaluate the experience, impact and implementation of the programme. This prospective study will evaluate the experience and impact of Stroke Odysseys on those participating using mixed methods (interviews, observations and surveys) prior to and after each stage of the programme, and carry out non-participant observations during a percentage of the workshops, training and tour.

This trial will also examine how effectively the programme is implemented and the factors (facilitators or barriers) that affect its implementation (i.e. implementation effectiveness). This will help us to identify not just 'if' but also 'why' the programme works and support our understanding of how it can be successfully delivered and scaled up within clinical pathways. Within this, the researchers will also explore the cost effectiveness of the programme, including the cost of its delivery and the balance of the benefit for the health sector, in order to be able to develop strong business plan for its longer-term use and wider scale implementation."

To identify dysphagia, patients are screened using a bedside tool and those suspected of dysphagia then have a specialist Speech and Language Therapy (SLT) assessment. Currently there is a wide range of screening protocols used. The aim of this research is to investigate the variation in dysphagia assessment and management to identify what factors affect the risk of SAP. The type of screen and other variations in management and practice (such as time from hospital admission to when the screen is done) will be investigated to identify any associations with higher risk of SAP. A mixed methods study will include a systematic review of the literature, interviews with patients, carers and staff and a review of medical records to investigate the patient journey during the first 72 hours from admission. Findings will be triangulated to inform a national survey of dysphagia screening and management in hospitals registered with the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP). Data from the survey will be cross-referenced with the SSNAP register and analysed to identify relationships. Results will inform development of an intervention to reduce SAP for subsequent feasibility testing."

NCT04611672,"Injured brain tissue supplied by a disturbed state of cerebral autoregulation (CA) is at risk of secondary ischemia, e.g. in patients with stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage or bacterial Meningitis. Up to now, there is lack of a simple and easy to perform bed side test that would allow for to intervene when CA failure is indicated. For this purpose, we explore the dynamics of the interplay between blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity using transcranial Doppler ultrasound (or near infrared spectroscopy derived haemoglobin concentration changes) as a measure of CA. To describe these dynamics different mathematical models are used, but they all still need validation and proof of concept because these dynamics are poorly understood with respect to the factors which influence the composition of the mathematical models.

NCT02753322,"Stroke is one of the most common chronic disabling conditions in Hong Kong. People after stroke may suffer from certain degree of physical impairment and disability. Resuming safe ambulation in the community appears to be a big challenge to them as it always involves the simultaneous performance of two or more tasks (dual task) such as walking and talking with someone, walking and recalling the shopping list etc. Numerous studies has demonstrated that the interference from dual tasks (dual task interference) may significantly impact the recovery of the functional walking. To date, the relevance of dual task walking to daily community is widely documented and the ability of managing dual task is therefore particularly important. Evidences supported that dual task training showed its promising effect on the balance and walking performance amongst people with neurological disorders, such as chronic stroke. In light of this, the introduction of dual task based balance and walking training into physiotherapy program for stroke patient may enhance the balance and walking performance and hence promote successful community ambulation. Yet, there is limited evidence on its effect in sub-acute stroke.

NCT04428112,"These caregivers are a vulnerable group due to their physical isolation and well-documented rural disparities in health care access and quality. Many rural dementia caregivers experience serious health consequences due to caregiving responsibilities that can limit their ability to maintain their caregiving role. Thus, there is a pressing need for effective, scalable, and accessible programs to support rural dementia caregivers.

Online programs offer a convenient and readily translatable option for program delivery because they can be accessed by caregivers in the home and at the convenience of the user. Building Better Caregivers is an online 6-week, interactive, small-group self-management, social support, and skills-building workshop developed for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia.

The investigators will conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial that will enroll and randomize 640 rural dementia caregivers into two groups: the intervention (workshop) group and the attention control group. Caregivers will be recruited throughout the United States. Primary outcomes will be caregiver stress and depression symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that stress scores and depression symptoms will be significantly improved at 12 months in the intervention group versus control group. The investigators will also identify key strengths (facilitators) and weaknesses (barriers) of workshop implementation. The investigators will use the RE-AIM implementation framework and a mixed methods approach to identify implementation characteristics pertinent to both caregivers and rural community organizations.

If the Building Better Caregivers workshop is proven to be effective, this research has the potential to open new research horizons, particularly on how to reach and effectively support isolated dementia caregivers in rural areas with an intervention that is scalable, even in low-resourced settings. If the workshop can achieve its goals with rural dementia caregivers, some of those most isolated, it would also be expected to be scalable in other low-resourced settings (e.g., in urban or suburban environments)."
NCT04468919,"This project adds to non-invasive BCIs for communication for adults with severe speech and physical impairments due to neurodegenerative diseases. Researchers will optimize & adapt BCI signal acquisition, signal processing, natural language processing, & clinical implementation. BCI-FIT relies on active inference and transfer learning to customize a completely adaptive intent estimation classifier to each user's multi-modality signals simultaneously. 3 specific aims are: 1. develop & evaluate methods for on-line & robust adaptation of multi-modal signal models to infer user intent; 2. develop & evaluate methods for efficient user intent inference through active querying, and 3. integrate partner & environment-supported language interaction & letter/word supplementation as input modality. The same 4 dependent variables are measured in each SA: typing speed, typing accuracy, information transfer rate (ITR), & user experience (UX) feedback. Four alternating-treatments single case experimental research designs will test hypotheses about optimizing user performance and technology performance for each aim.Tasks include copy-spelling with BCI-FIT to explore the effects of multi-modal access method configurations (SA1.3a), adaptive signal modeling (SA1.3b), & active querying (SA2.2), and story retell to examine the effects of language model enhancements. Five people with SSPI will be recruited for each study. Control participants will be recruited for experiments in SA2.2 and SA3.4. Study hypotheses are: (SA1.3a) A customized BCI-FIT configuration based on multi-modal input will improve typing accuracy on a copy-spelling task compared to the standard P300 matrix speller. (SA1.3b) Adaptive signal modeling will allow people with SSPI to typing accurately during a copy-spelling task with BCI-FIT without training a new model before each use. (SA2.2) Either of two methods of adaptive querying will improve BCI-FIT typing accuracy for users with mediocre AUC scores. (SA3.4) Language model enhancements, including a combination of partner and environmental input and word completion during typing, will improve typing performance with BCI-FIT, as measured by ITR during a story-retell task.

NCT04388891,"The ReHapticKnob is a robot for hand rehabilitation after stroke. We aim to investigate the feasibility of minimally supervised therapy with the ReHapticKnob with stroke patients in a rehabilitation clinic, evaluate the usability of the ReHapticKnob (user interface and implemented exercises which were adapted for independent usage), and quantify the dose of additional robotic therapy that patients perform in a minimally supervised setting.

Minimally supervised therapy means that after a training phase, where the therapists teach to the patients how to perform the exercises with the robot, the patients can autonomously train with the robot during free time without being directly supervised. Our hypothesis is that minimally supervised therapy might be a possible way to increase therapy dose for stroke patients, with the potential to further improve recovery of hand function with minimal additional burden for therapists and for the healthcare system."

NCT02347995,"Stroke survivors experience severe muscle wasting during the chronic phase of recovery, with implications for strength, function and general health. Although resistive exercise training effectively combats this problem, it is unknown whether sub-optimal protein intake limits the observed gains in skeletal muscle growth. Skeletal muscle adaptations may occur when resistive training (RT) is combined with nutritional therapy in the form of post- exercise protein consumption. This study would be the first to directly compare RT+protein supplementation to RT+placebo (same calories as protein supplement) in those with chronic hemiparesis caused by stroke, providing evidence-based rationale for combination therapy in the clinical care of this population."
NCT03661411,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is one of common diseases with significant morbidity, mortality and disability. A wide array of studies confirms that intravenous thrombolytic therapy with alteplase can effectively improve the functional prognosis in acute ischemic stroke. Thus all guidelines recommended the intravenous thrombolytic therapy with alteplase for acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours from stroke onset.

Minor stroke is usually defined as NIHSS score ≤ 3 or 5，although it accounts for 1/2-2/3 of AIS, the evidence of thrombolysis is insufficient. A study from Canada shows that 28.5% of patients with minor stroke who have not receive rt-pa thrombolytic therapy are unable to walk independently when discharged. Based on such a consideration,the PRISMS study further compares the efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy with antithrombotic therapy in patients with minor stroke. Unfortunately, the study has been early terminated due to the sponsorship reason in 2018, with only 313 cases enrolled. The preliminary results shows that there is no significant difference of the 90-day neurological function between the two groups, while the safety of the treatment group with alteplase has a higher rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. The patient receiving thrombolysis can not be given antithrombolytic therapy within 24 hours even if the patient's condition has worsened, is clinically more puzzling.

The CHANCE study in 2013 shows that the efficacy of aspirin with clopidogrel is superior to aspirin alone with minor stroke (NIHSS < 3) or TIA(ABCD2 < 4). The POINT study in 2018 further confirmed the efficacy and safety of intensive antithrombotic therapy within 12 hours of onset with minor stroke.

Based on the above discussion, this study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of aspirin with clopidogrel vs alteplase in the treatment of acute minor stroke."

NCT02743728,"The incidence of perinatal stroke is relatively common, as high as 1 in 2,300 births, but little is known about the resulting changes in the brain that eventually manifest as cerebral palsy (CP). Motor signs that indicate the infant is beginning to develop CP often do not become evident for several months after the diagnosis of perinatal stroke which delays therapy. The main purpose of this study is to examine early brain reorganization in infants 3-12 months of age corrected for prematurity with perinatal stroke using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In addition, the association between the brain reorganization and motor outcomes of these infant participants will be identified.

In this study, the MRI scans will include diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) - an established method used to investigate the integrity of pathways in the brain that control limb movement. Infants will be scanned during nature sleeping after feeding. The real scanning time will be less than 38 minutes. TMS is a painless, non-surgical brain stimulation device which uses principles of electromagnetic induction to excite cortical tissue from outside the skull. Using TMS as a device to modulate and examine cortical excitability in children with hemiparetic CP and in adults has been conducted previously.

In this infant study, we will assess cortical excitability from the motor cortex of both the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres under the guidance of a frameless stereotactic neuronavigation system. Additionally, the investigators will assess infants' movement quality using an age-appropriate standardized movement assessment. This will allow the investigators to examine the relationship between measures of motor pathway integrity and early signs of potential motor impairment. We will longitudinally follow enrolled infants, and complete repeat assessments at 12- and 24-months corrected age to assess how infants develop over time after perinatal stroke. The remote follow-up will occur at 5 years or less."

NCT02736747,"The stroke has been described as the third cause of death and main cause of disability in the worldwide population. About 60% of the survivors are able to walk following the rehabilitation process, however deficits on lower limbs functions often persists in most cases, affecting the gait and functional mobility. In this sense, several interventions are applied in the clinical practice to optimize the functional performance. Cryotherapy is one of the most used techniques aiming to reduce spasticity temporarily, allowing the training of functional tasks, such as walking. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the immediate effects of cryotherapy (ice pack) on neuromuscular performance, proprioception, passive resistance of dorsiflexors and plantarflexors muscles, and also on gait performance in chronic post-stroke subjects. Eighteen chronic hemiparetic subjects will participate in this crossover placebo-controlled trial. The order of intervention (cryotherapy or placebo) will be randomized. Fifteen days of washout period will be considered. The cryotherapy/placebo will be applied on the posterior area of the leg for 20 minutes. Initially Fugl Meyer will be applied. All other assessments will be performed before and after intervention: spasticity level, classified according to Modified Ashworth Scale; temporo-spatial and angular parameters for trunk, hip, knee and ankle during gait, using a motion analysis system (Qualysis AB, Gothenburg, Sweden); the proprioception (joint position sense), passive resistance to stretching, isometric and isokinetic torques during contractions of plantarflexors and dorsiflexors of the ankle, evaluated through isokinetic dynamometer. Concomitantly, bilateral activation of soleus, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior and peroneus will be assessed by electromyography during isokinetic dynamometer assessment and gait. The following electromyographic variables will be analyzed: maximum activation amplitude, muscle onset, coactivation index between agonists and antagonists. For statistical analysis, normality (Shapiro Wilk) and homogeneity (Levene) tests will be applied. If the variables have a distribution considered normal and homogeneous, Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures will be applied. Otherwise, non-parametric statistics (Friedman test) will be applied.

NCT03578536,"Current protocols for therapy on a rehabilitation unit call for intensive rehabilitation composed of high intensity, long duration therapy. Evidence from brain healing and animal research, along with motor learning principles suggest that a treatment program composed of short duration therapy sessions distributed throughout the day may provide better rehabilitation outcomes for stroke patients. Such a program can be implemented using constraint-induced therapy in which the Veteran is provided with opportunities to use the affected limb while participating in a video game and completing complementary tasks in therapy. Additionally, rehabilitation outcomes may improve if Veterans are provided with regular opportunities to participate in gaming therapy at home after discharge from the hospital rather than having to travel to a clinic or receive limited or no follow-up in rural areas.

This project will develop a therapeutic model that promotes use of the impaired arm and hand. Researchers often call this type of therapy ""constraint induced therapy"". In this study, participants focus on using the impaired limb rather than the unaffected limb. A small group of patients will participate in a question and answer session about preferences for activities which make up transfer tasks. Up to twenty-four (24) Veterans inpatient with hemiparesis due to stroke in the brain will be recruited from the Minneapolis VA Health Care System. Study participants will only be able to play the game using the impaired limb. Participants may also receive automated reminders to use the impaired arm throughout the day.

NCT03854500,"Background: Alteplase is the only approved acute drug treatment in ischemic stroke and aims at dissolving arterial clots causing cerebral ischemia. The overall benefit of alteplase is substantial. However, there is considerable room for improvement as 2/3 of patients with large clots may not achieve reopening of the vessel and up to 40% of the patients remain severely disabled or die.

Tenecteplase, a modified tissue plasminogen activator, has been shown to be a more efficient and safer thrombolytic drug than alteplase in pre-clinical studies. Tenecteplase has replaced alteplase as thrombolytic treatment in myocardial infarction and may also be the drug of choice in ischemic stroke.

Tenecteplase and alteplase had a similar safety profile in the NOR-TEST trial and there were no differences in efficacy between the two treatment groups. However, a majority of patients had mild stroke which may be associated with a natural favorable prognosis.

In spite of these neutral results, tenecteplase has the potential to replace alteplase as the drug of choice, based on a better pharmacological profile and a simpler practical administration. There is, however, need for a higher number of patients to prove the efficacy and safety of tenecteplase.

Hypothesis: Tenecteplase 0.4 mg/kg is non-inferior compared with alteplase 0.9 mg/kg."
NCT02681146,"A stepped-wedge cluster design will be used, with the duration of the trial being 50 weeks. The 'stepped-wedge ' cluster randomised trial is a form of cross-over design with unidirectional cross-over ( from control to experimental ) but with randomisation of when each cluster undertakes this transition. In the stepped-wedge design, there is a staggered roll-out of the intervention, where the time and hence the sequence of units (clusters) that will start the intervention at each period is determined by random allocation.

The randomisation occurs before the start of the trial. All clusters start the trial in a control phase with no intervention being delivered at any site, then sequentially cross over from the control group to the intervention group, until all sites are receiving the intervention. Outcomes are measured on the study participants in all clusters at every time period, hence measurement of outcomes takes place at each step in the wedge; each cluster provides data points in the control and intervention conditions allowing each site to act as its own control."

NCT02666469,"Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and death in North America and Europe. Up to 30% of stroke survivors never recuperate completely and suffer from loss of function and poor quality of life. To improve recovery after stroke, innovative interventions should be a priority.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is an intermittent inhalation of 100% oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber at a pressure higher than 1 absolute atmosphere (ATA). There is a growing body of evidence that HBOT can enhance ability of brain to changes its structure (neuroplasticity) in order to recover. Exercise program during HBOT can augment the effect. Although, recent randomized controlled trials in patients with chronic brain injury showed promising results, there are no studies demonstrating combine effect HBOT and exercise rehabilitation program on stroke recovery.

The proposed study investigates feasibility, safety and efficacy of using a combination of HBOT and exercise program to improve arm function recovery in chronic stroke patients.

NCT02658578,"Cerebrovascular disease is a major cause of disability worldwide. The catastrophic burden of stroke is more dramatic in low- and middle- income countries, and the scarcity of evidence-based rehabilitation interventions represents a major challenge to global health care. Upper limb weakness is frequent after stroke, but there is no universally accepted treatment to effectively improve hand function in patients with moderate and severe motor impairment. These are the patients in deepest need of rehabilitative interventions. This project addresses this important issue, by testing effects of a novel approach. The investigators will non-invasively stimulate peripheral nerves in order to enhance effects of motor training aided by an electrical stimulation device in patients with moderate to severe hand weakness. Our hypothesis is that peripheral nerve stimulation will enhance effects of motor training in patients in the chronic stage after stroke."

NCT02618603,"Shoulder pain after stroke is a very common, causing significant morbidity disease. Subacromial and subdeltoid (SASD) bursitis are common causes of pain or disability of the shoulder joint in stroke patients. Traditional therapeutic approaches for the shoulder pain therapy including pharmacotherapy, injection therapy, physical therapy, and behavioural modification. Unfortunately, these therapy methods may not be effective in many patients and long term benefit after treatment is transient, the outcomes may also be incomplete or non-existent. Botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) is a neurotoxin that can inhibit not only the acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junctions but also other neurotransmitters such as glutamate, substance P and calcitonin gene related peptide, all of which have been indicated in pain transmission. Despite the therapeutic benefit of BTX in alleviating painful muscle spasms, its efficacy in SASD bursitis conditions is less clear.

NCT03759106,"Stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability worldwide and its incidence is on the rise. Importantly, loss of arm function occurs in up to 85% of stroke survivors, with a significant long-term impact on activities of daily living, leisure activities and work. The capacity for recovery following a stroke depends on several factors, including the extent of the initial neurological damage, spontaneous recovery and rehabilitation, with possible recovery even years after the stroke. Unfortunately, accessibility of much needed rehabilitation services poststroke often remains limited, both in terms of intensity and duration, as reported in a recent report on post-stroke rehabilitation services in Quebec. Recent evidence suggests that homebased telerehabilitation (TR) is a viable approach for upper limb training post-stroke when rehabilitation services are not available. Similarly, the Canadian Best Practice Recommendations for Stroke Care update for 2013 recommends home-based patient monitoring be used when frequent monitoring is needed and face-to-face visits are not available. Hence, the investigators have developed and propose to examine the use of the VirTele system for people who have suffered a stroke who are no longer receiving rehabilitation services The VirTele system allows upper limb rehabilitation using exergames with ongoing off-line monitoring combined with online monitoring and coaching based on the self-determination theory."

NCT03903770,"Approximately 80% of individuals with chronic stroke present with long lasting upper extremity (UE) impairments. Advances in rehabilitation technology, such as robotics, virtual reality (VR) and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), have separately demonstrated their effectiveness in improving UE function of individuals with stroke. The potential to influence recovery may be further enhanced by combining these modalities in order to target motor deficits of the individual. Research has shown that not all persons with stroke may be able to recover hand function. In particular, such recovery depends on the integrity of the corticospinal tract (CST), which links the motor areas of the brain to the UE (and hand) musculature. Instead of using a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to UE rehabilitation, CST integrity will be assessed through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive approach, and match the intervention to the individual's specific impairments. The perSonalized UPper Extremity Rehabilitation (SUPER) intervention is proposed, which combines robotics, VR activities, and NMES. The objectives of this study are to determine the feasibility of the SUPER intervention in individuals with moderate/severe stroke. Stroke participants will receive a 5-week intervention (3x per week) combining robotic therapy and VR activities, based on their functional level. Those with low potential for hand recovery will receive an intervention focussing on elbow and shoulder movements. For those with a good potential for hand recovery, the last 30 minutes of the robotic or VR session will be complemented by muscle-triggered NMES. Feasibility indicators associated with process, resources, management and treatment will be measured. Outcomes of UE and hand function will include the Fugl-Meyer upper extremity assessment, the Box and Block test and the ABILHAND. It is expected that feasibility criteria will be met and that the SUPER intervention will lead to significant improvements in UE impairment compared to a waitlist group."

NCT03244527,"In the past few years, Branched Chain Amino Acid (BCAA) supplements have gradually used on different groups. From training athletes, maintaining functions of healthy elders to preventing disabilities of people that can't do intense exercises. BCAAs are now considered to be able to prevent muscle atrophy and strength loss, also possible to increase strength and muscle mass if combined with resistance exercises. Stroke patients have difficulties with moving, which led to multiple disabilities, are more likely to have sarcopenia and strength loss. Furthermore, reducing the will of moving or walking. Recently, studies showed that combined BCAAs with resistance exercises can effectively increase muscle mass, thus commonly used on training athletes.

Although aerobic exercises are proven to be more likely to improve walking ability of chronic stroke patients than traditional rehabilitation, BCAAs' effects are yet to be proven. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore if BCAAs combined with moderate intensity exercises can prevent muscle atrophy, loss of strength and cardiopulmonary function.

This is a randomized control trial. Participants are randomly assigned to either experiment or control groups. Both group received aerobic exercise (30 min in a session, 3 days a week, and for 8 weeks). Experiment group received BCAA supplement immediately after the exercise while the control group receive sham product (vitamins). The outcome measurements (including muscle mass, functional measures, and quality of life) are performed before (0-wk) and after (8-wk) the interventions, also after interventions in 3 months and 6 months for follow up."

NCT03242304,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) represents an economical challenge for health systems all over the globe. Despite increasing knowledge of the pathophysiology of AIS, there is no satisfactory treatment to revert the resulting brain damage. Changes of neuroactive steroids have been found in different neurological diseases. In this regard, the investigators have previously demonstrated that old patients with AIS show changes of plasma cortisol and estradiol concentrations, in that increased steroid levels are associated with a deterioration of neurological status and a worse cognitive decline. The present study assessed in patients with AIS if changes of behavior, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nitrites (NO-2) (nitric oxide soluble metabolite) bear a relationship with the degree of hypercortisolism. To this purpose, the investigators recruited patients hospitalized at the Central Military Hospital emergency room within the first 24 hours of AIS. Subjects were divided into two groups, each one composed of 40 control subjects and 40 AIS patients, including men and women. The neurological condition was assessed using the NIHSS and the cognitive status with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA test). The emotional status was evaluated using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), whereas the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) was used to determine the functional condition.

NCT04370197,"The Covid-19 pandemic is a pandemic of an emerging infectious disease, coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19), caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It appears in November 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China, and spreads worldwide from February 2020. The first cases of infection in France were confirmed on 24 January 2020. As of April 14, 103,573 cases of infection were confirmed, 32,292 hospitalized cases, including 6,730 in intensive care, with 15,729 deaths recorded1. The most affected regions are Ile de France and the Grand Est (in particular the Haut-Rhin department). Containment of the entire French population was introduced on 17 March, with the aim of reducing the spread of the virus and relieving the burden on the health system, particularly the intensive care units.

This unprecedented health crisis, as well as the social containment measures in themselves, has repercussions on other acute medical pthologies, not directly related to the viral infection. It appears that the number of patients treated for acute stroke has suddenly declined since the beginning of the epidemic.

However, it is not clear whether it is the incidence of stroke that has declined or simply the proportion of patients presenting within the time frame that allows for treatment in the acute phase (by thrombolysis or thrombectomy)."

NCT03744533,"Currently, the guideline recommended re-perfusion such as intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy as the most effective treatment for acute ischemic stroke. However, the two methods are restricted by a strict time window, which greatly limits the number of the patients receiving treatment. The abundant studies have suggested that good collateral circulation can provide compensatory blood supply to save the ischemic penumbra and reduces the infarct volume, which improves the prognosis. How to improve collateral circulation in an efficient and safe way is a clinical challenge. Our recent experiment results of the animal and preliminary clinical experiments show that head-down position may significantly increase cerebral perfusion and improve neurological function. Clinically, head-down position is simple and easy to operate, and theoretically may increases brain perfusion and improve collateral circulation.

NCT03708835,"Stroke affects both the patient's and the caregiver's whole life by creating permanent damages. Patients and their families need further information and support in the transition from hospital to home. For stroke patients and their families after discharge, transition models can be used to provide continuously and rapidly the service by establishing a communication network between the institutions. In this study, the feasibility and impact of a transitional care model from hospital to home for stroke patients and caregivers will be tested.

The purpose of the project is to assess the effect of Transitional Care Model (TCM)-based interventions for stroke patients and their caregivers on caregivers' competence, in increasing their readiness to care and electronic health literacy, in reducing their burnout, and on patient results. Types of interventions that are applied to stroke patients and caregivers based on Transitional Care Model are hospital interview, home visit, telephone interview and web-based training. As stated in TCM, the intervention was planned to be performed three months after discharge.

Multiple interventions including at least three face-to-face interviews at the hospital, distance education via Web and telephone communication for three months, and one home visit within seven days after discharge will be performed in order to increase health literacy levels and caregiving competence of the caregivers and to reduce burnout. In pre-tests and post-tests to be applied to the caregivers, the effectiveness of the support programs provided will be assessed quantitatively by the electronic health literacy, caregiving competence, and burnout scales. The satisfaction with the intervention will be evaluated qualitatively. Rate of return to the hospital, risk of pressure sore, and time of access to home health services will be assessed in stroke patients.

As a result of web-based distance education, home visit, telephone communication service and informing at the hospital, caregivers of stroke patients will begin to receive information about what patients experience during their treatment and about all what patients need after treatment.

NCT03721523,"Stroke is a significant medical problem with 150,000 events occurring per year in the UK and incurring healthcare costs of £4 billion per year. Fifty percent of strokes will leave a lasting disability on first manifestation and 10-15% (roughly 16,500 per year) are unheralded ischaemic events in previously asymptomatic Carotid artery disease.

Carotid Artery Disease is caused by the formation of an atherosclerotic plaque in the vessel. Stroke or TIA occurs when plaque or adherent thrombus breaks off and embolises to the brain, blocking off its blood supply. Hence, a carotid plaque is said to be symptomatic if it has caused a Stroke or TIA in the territory of the brain supplied by that vessel in the previous six months.

Currently, the degree of stenosis (narrowing) of the artery by doppler ultrasound is the main assessment performed. Doppler ultrasound measures stenosis and elevation of blood flow velocity in the artery prior to surgical intervention. However, it has been shown that the degree of stenosis is a poor predictor of stroke as many asymptomatic patients have severe stenosis and many symptomatic patients have moderate stenosis. Stenosis is a two dimensional assessment of a 3-D structure.

Other features of the plaque should be considered including the volume of the carotid plaque and its constituents. Carotid Plaque Volume has been measured in 339 individuals, with plaque volume being higher in symptomatic than asymptomatic individuals. In this study, plaque volume did not correlate with stenosis degree. No studies have been conducted measuring the change in carotid plaque volume and morphology following a stroke. This pilot study will perform serial duplex scans on recently symptomatic individuals over a 12 week period and observe the changes in Plaque Volume and morphology. This will attempt to prove that carotid plaque volume is a better predictor of stroke than stenosis. The investigators will also aim to identify other plaque features that may have an important role in predicting stroke risk. Documenting the timescale of change in plaque volume will aid us in defining appropriate timescales for treating the symptomatic population and when those having medical management's risk has returned to baseline. Observing the change in plaque immediately after stroke will improve our knowledge of the changes in plaques that lead to symptoms and may in the future help us predict which patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis need operation."

NCT05174676,"Background: Stroke is a common cause of morbidity, including paresis, and stroke survivors often have reduced function in their paretic arm. Many do not regain full recovery of their arm function, which negatively impacts their quality of life. Recent studies have indicated that robotic training may improve upper limb function abilities among stroke survivors, by enabling repetitive, adaptive, and intensive training and more accurate control of task complexity. Robotic training in addition to standard rehabilitative care has shown promise for improving functional skills among stroke survivors. One type of robotic training is error enhancement, whereby an error made by the patient is exaggerated, increasing the signal to noise ratio which causes errors to be more noticeable. This, in turn, enhances movement correction. Previous studies have found that error enhancement has promise as a clinical treatment for patients with motor deficits.

Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the effect of a robotic device (DeXtreme) on the functional capabilities of the paretic arm of stroke survivors. This device aims to improve arm function by utilizing error enhancement techniques.

Methods: A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study comparing treatment outcomes between two groups to assess the effect of error enhancement robotic training on functional use of the arm and hand in patients after stroke. Forty stroke patients will undergo 6 sessions of 25 minutes each with the Dextreme device. One group will receive training with error enhancement forces applied, while the control group will receive similar training without error enhancement. Outcomes (motor function, speed, tone, and spasticity) will be assessed twice prior to and following the treatment sessions,"

It has been documented that hemiplegic or hemiparetic stroke patients presented with more posture sway, asymmetric weight distribution, impaired weight-shifting ability and decreased stability capability. There are many balance exercises and strategies; to improve balance in elderly age group population, to prevent fall prevention. But we have very few evidences of giving manual perturbation balance training in stroke patients to improve speed, balance and function. Therefore this study is taken up to examine whether the manual perturbation balance training is more effective in improving speed, balance and function in stroke patients."
NCT03234634,"This study is a prospective, partly randomized, multi-center, Phase III, controlled trial, designed to show that the onset-to-puncture time (OPT) for good functional outcome (defined by modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months, 0-2) can be set depending on collateral status based on multiphase CT angiogram. The purpose of this study is to prove that (1) for patients with poor collaterals, there will no difference in good outcome rate between endovascular treatment and best medical treatment group if onset-to-puncture time is between 150 minutes and 600 minutes, and 2) for patients wih good collaterals, the rate of good outcome is equal to or greater than 42% (10% greater than historical control) if onset-to-puncture time is between 150 minutes and 600 minutes. Patients will initially be classified into 3 arms based on both collateral status on multiphase CT angiography and whether or not receiving endovascular thrombectomy: group 1, patients with good collaterals and receiving endovascular thrombectomy, 2) group 2a, patient with poor collaterals and receiving endovascular thrombectomy, and 3) group 2b, patients with poor collaterals and not receiving endovascular thrombectomy. Patients with good collaterals will receive endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) if onset-to-puncture time is between 150 minutes and 600 minutes after last seen well time. Of the patients with poor collaterals, they will be randomized into endovascular treatment and best medical treatment group, if onset-to-puncture time is between 150 minutes and 600 minutes, (onset-to-puncture time is not possible within 150 minutes but possible within 600 minutes after last seen well).

NCT02725853,"Many people who have had a stroke have problems recovering the use of their affected arm and these problems may persist for a long time. The investigators' research will test new ways to boost recovery by using non-painful brain stimulation together with training of arm movements using basic science principles. The training program will be done using the latest technology in rehabilitation such as virtual reality and robotics. The investigators will compare three groups of patients who have had a stroke. Each group will receive different combinations of brain stimulation and arm training. Another aspect of this proposal is that the investigators will do the same training programs in three different countries - Canada, Israel and India. In this way, the investigators will combine knowledge and skills to create training programs that can be applied anywhere in the world and that are not necessarily limited to high-income countries. Also, by combining expertise, the investigators will help to build the capacity to do research in India, a middle-income country that has great potential to contribute new knowledge to rehabilitation medicine."

NCT04261257,"Stroke can be linked to atherosclerosis of the large vessels, occlusion of the small intracerebral vessels (gaps), cardioembolic pathology or other rarer etiologies.

The cardioembolic etiology of stroke in elderly patients may be difficult to prove. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cause of cerebral infarction (25%). Detecting AF is not easy. A 24-hour long-term holter and an implantable cardiac monitor (Reveal®) may be required. This etiology is all the more important as it requires anticoagulation treatment reducing the risk of recurrence in the short and long term. The left atrium thrombus is an indisputable marker of atrial fibrillation but it is rarely seen. Other cardiac etiologies such as a thrombus in the left ventricle, a large plaque or a thrombus of the aortic arch are possible. Finally, the permeable oval foramen and the aneurysm of the intra-auricular septum constitute a cause apart in young subjects (<60 years).

Typically, the search for thrombus of the left atrium goes through a trans-thoracic cardiac ultrasound and a transesophageal cardiac ultrasound. These examinations, often negative, are performed several days after the onset of the cerebral infarction. The transesophageal cardiac ultrasound, considered as the ""gold standard"" examination to look for an intracardiac thrombus and an embologenic plaque in the aortic arch, is poorly tolerated. It is rarely performed in patients over 75 years of age. In addition, the length of stay for these patients may increase due to the wait for these exams.

Several studies have validated the non-inferiority of the cardiac scanner compared to the transesophageal cardiac ultrasound for the detection of intracardiac thrombus (left atrium or left ventricle).

In the study by Hur et al. performed in 55 consecutive patients with a probable cardioembolic infarction, 14 thrombi of the left atrium were detected and confirmed by the cardiac scanner, but the patients were young, with a median age of 61 years. In the Berlin prospective HEBRAS study, 475 patients underwent cardiovascular MRI. The results are being analyzed but the cardiac scanner is more sensitive for the detection of thrombus in the left atrium.

A prospective study confirmed that the cardiac scanner is more precise in differentiating the left atrial thrombus from circulatory stasis in patients with stroke In this study, there is no information on the time between the stroke and the completion of the cardiac scanner.

Almost all patients with stroke benefit from an angio-scan of the CT scan of supra-aortic trunks as part of the urgent assessment on Day 1 or Day 2. The investigators propose to perform at the same time a cardiac scanner in order to allow a rapid morphological cardiological assessment, at the level of the left atrium, the left ventricle and the arch of the aorta."

NCT03194282,"Poor balance capacity is one of clinical symptoms of stroke patient. The reason of loss balance capacity is motor impairment, as well as a diminished capacity to voluntarily shift body weight or to with stand external pertubations. Postural movement patterns include three discrete control strategies: hip, knee, and ankle strategy. The ankle rocker is an important factor to maintain balance during standing and the ankle strategy restores the center of mass (CoM) to a position of stability through body movement. As a result, effective control of foot motion and ankle stability may decrease postural sway and the risk of fall in chronic stroke.The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the insole on balance capacity in chronic stroke."

It is usually described for the peripheral muscles that there is a cortical representation contralaterale with a crossed cortico-spinal route: the consequence is a contralaterale motor disorder on the brain damage.

The impact of a stroke on diaphragm movements have been described in 6 studies: however, they were all observational and transversal studies evaluating diaphragm function.

Assessment using diaphragm thickness is another technique described in the literature. Visualization of diaphragm in the zone of apposition allows to assess diaphragm thickness at inspiration and expiration. The impact of a stroke on diaphragm thickening has been reported in only one recent observational study.

It seems that diaphragm would be damaged after a stroke, but unilateral or bilateral dysfonction is yet to be confirmed. Moreover, only a few measurements were performed in these studies, and not a diaphragm function follow-up."

NCT05253989,"Novel approaches are needed for the management of stroke patients, as current practice relies on the presence of a qualified professional, of which there are severe shortages. Rehabilitation technologies provide a unique solution to this problem. Recent technological advances in EMG signal processing mean that researchers are now able to decompose EMG recordings of the residual muscle activity of stroke survivors. This information can be used to detect biomarkers of a patient's functional status, allowing an objective measure of function to be obtained. This information could be used to predict patient recovery and decide on the best course of treatment. Furthermore, this technology can be used to predict attempted patient movements, which could be used to drive a virtual reality interface that gives feedback on movement attempts. This could be delivered through a gaming interface, creating an enjoyable and motivational rehabilitation technology for stroke patients, and providing a treatment option for the most severe patients. Synchronizing patients' attempted movements with electrical stimulation of the desired muscle groups may further enhance neuroplasticity and rehabilitation outcomes. Advances in electronics have made it so electrical stimulation systems are wearable, portable and comfortable, commonplace in rehabilitation clinics and accessible to the general public (https://www.surge.co.uk/).

In order to verify the clinical validity of such an approach, there is a need to conduct a large scale trial (6 months). The purpose of this study will be to assess the clinical validity of a gaming-based intervention driven by EMG activity in promoting long-term functional recovery. The study will also be assessing the capability of an AI algorithm to predict long-term recovery based on biomarkers detected in the early EMG signals. The team wishes to conduct a large scale trial to learn from the past mistakes of rehabilitation technologies, which were insufficiently powered to result in statistically significant outcomes, especially given the heterogeneous nature of the stroke population.

The impact of such an intervention could be revolutionary for stroke patients. It would provide a treatment option for severe stroke patients, where none currently exists. It also ensures that rehabilitation could be commenced within the most time-critical period (the earliest weeks following stroke). Such an intervention would integrate easily into existing care practice and relieve some of the pressure on the NHS. The long-term impact would be to significantly improve the lives of stroke survivors and substantially reduce the burden on the NHS.

Furthermore, the implications of this technology would go beyond stroke rehabilitation, and could be used in any patient with any form of paralysis. In order to test and validate this, the study team are also looking to include a small proportion of spinal cord injury patients in the protocol. The rationale being two-fold: they provide an alternative recruitment pool, with a simpler injury that does not also cause cognitive impairments, meaning they will be easier to collect data from and draw meaningful conclusions, in addition, it will help support that this technology can be useful in different patient groups and provide insight for future research directions. Spinal cord injury was chosen as a second condition, as like stroke it is one of the largest causes of paralysis, but tends to affect a younger patient population, which will allow us to compare the efficacy of this treatment approach in different age groups."
NCT05595941,"Stroke is a major health problem and can cause long-term disability. Among these sequelae, there are balance and mobility disorders, but also a higher rate of anxiety or depression disorders. This impairments impact activity of daily living, and social reintegration. That why the investigators need to explore options for long-term sustainable interventions that which takes into account the patient as a whole. In particular, regular physical activity is recommended, but it must be adaptable to the patient's impairments. Teaching yoga may be an interesting option. Indeed, yoga is a mind-body practice which become increasingly widespread in the world. Recent studies highlight positive effect of yoga for this population. However, accessibility to yoga classes can be limited by many factors: lack of transportation, lack of available health professionals, confinement requirements... Therefore, it seems relevant to evaluate the effectiveness of yoga delivered through tele-rehabilitation.

The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a tele-yoga program adapted to stroke survivors to improve their functional balance.

The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effectiveness of the adapted tele-yoga program in improving functional mobility, anxiety, depression and reintegration into normal life."
NCT01665729,"Negligence or contempt of the etiology and pathogenesis of minor ischaemic stroke in the early diagnosis and effective treatment leads to more than 40-50% of patient with recurrent episodes, and 10% patient died. Therefore, diagnosis and treatment of minor ischaemic stroke according to the etiology and pathogenesis is important.

The 2007 Korean modified TOAST type got some progress, but there exists two major disadvantages: imperfect diagnosis and pathogenesis of perforator artery infarction etiology; lack of typing according to the pathogenesis of large atherosclerotic infarction and taking measures of treatment according to the new types. Recently, domestic professor Gaoshan proposes new approach to diagnose and treat minor ischaemic stroke according to the etiology and pathogenesis of CISS typing, but the pathogenesis of hypoperfusion infarction with severe stenosis of large artery is unclear. Is it low perfusion? Or artery-artery embolization? Or both? How to distinguish the pathogenesis of branch artery disease: by atherosclerosis? Or hyalinosis? Or both? How to check the validity of clinical types? This study take different interventions according to different types and observation of the long term clinical results of intervention( mortality, recurrence rate, disability rate and rate of cerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage), in order to clarify the new types can indeed solve the current problem of minor ischaemic stroke with high mortality, recurrence rate, disability rate and rate of cerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage."
NCT01655264,"The overall goal of the study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a home-based tele-motion-rehabilitation (TMR) program in improving functional status of people who had stroke. We hypothesize that the clinical effectiveness within a mock-up set up in the hospital of the TMR will be greater in comparison to self-training exercise carried out at home in improving outcomes of Range of Motion and functional performance of the weak upper extremity.

Twenty-four subjects who had a stroke, aged between 18 and 80 years, and living at home will participate. Subjects will be 2-72 months post stroke, and no longer receiving rehabilitation as in or out patient. They will have moderate impairment of the affected upper extremity determined by range of motion (ROM). Subjects will be evaluated for motor and cognitive abilities for a total of 5-6 hours by a skilled therapist who will be blind to group's assignment of the subjects. The evaluations will be repeated 3 times, once before the intervention commences, once immediately following the intervention and once four weeks after the intervention.

Subjects will be randomized into the two groups (TMR versus self-training treatment) with matching for level of impairment of the upper extremity by a person who is not part of the study. Each subject will receive twelve 45-60 min sessions over 4 weeks while seated. The control group will receive self-training exercises that are based on conventional therapy using principles of motor control and will include training of upper extremity movements in order to achieve better use of the affected arm in ADL. The experimental group will receive TMR treatment of comparable duration and intensity to those in the conventional treatment group with remote online monitoring by the therapist. Treatment feedback will be given in the form of Knowledge of results (game scores) and Knowledge of performance (feedback of compensatory movements made while using the upper extremity) to enhance motor learning. The software will generate a report which will include the duration and type of exercises performed by the subject.

NCT01500564,"Previous research that utilises single sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have demonstrated functional improvements. However these improvements are usually short-lived, lasting less than one hour before the patient's performance returns to baseline. In these studies, tDCS is typically applied with the goal of adaptively enhancing functional activation of pathologically under-active tissue or suppressing pathologically over-active tissue. Interestingly, a small body of evidence is now emerging to indicate that tDCS can improve learning/memory functions in healthy controls. The goal of this study is to test if the application of tDCS could enhance learning and/or memory for physiotherapy rehabilitation, which may in turn lead to correspondingly greater motor improvement. Patients at a subacute stage (1 to 6 month post stroke) will attend for 10 consecutive daily sessions of tDCS.

This research has important implications; previous studies suggest that such an approach has the potential to facilitate physical rehabilitation post-stroke and establish tDCS as a clinically viable rehabilitative tool. Recovery of motor skills may take many months to acquire and therefore strategies that have the potential to enhance acquisition of skill are of practical and scientific interest."
NCT03642509,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is progressively common, and increases the risk of stroke five-fold. Oral anticoagulation is the mainstay therapy; however, it increases the risk of bleeding.

NCT05437237,"Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) enormously improves the prognosis of patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke, but its effect is highly time-dependent. Direct presentation of patients with an LVO stroke to an EVT-capable hospital reduces onset-to-treatment time by 40-115 minutes and thereby improves clinical outcome. Electroencephalography (EEG) may be a suitable prehospital stroke triage instrument for identifying LVO stroke, as differences have been found between EEG recordings of patients with an LVO stroke and those of suspected acute ischemic stroke patients with a smaller or no vessel occlusion. The investigators expect EEG can be performed in less than five minutes in the prehospital setting using a dry electrode EEG cap. An automatic LVO-detection algorithm will be the key to reliable, simple and fast interpretation of EEG recordings by ambulance paramedics. The primary objective of this study is to develop one or more novel AI-based algorithms (the AI-STROKE algorithms) with optimal diagnostic accuracy for identification of LVO stroke in patients with a suspected acute ischemic stroke in the prehospital setting, based on ambulant EEG data."

Many of them will have severe function deficits and reduced quality of life. The investigators have established a cohort consisting of 800 patients with first time ischemic stroke treated at hospitals in Central Norway. The investigators want to study the incidence and prognostic markers for death, recurrent stroke and severe functional deficits during a period of 10 years after the initial ischemic stroke. The investigators want to focus on the impact of physical functioning, the level of physical activity and use of medication for secondary prevention on the incidence of death, recurrent stroke and severe functional deficits. The investigators are especially interested in the importance of fulfilling the treatment targets for blood pressure and cholesterol and the importance of smoking cessation in stroke survivors.

NCT04430153,"This study was organized to investigate the real upper limb use in persons after stroke. Persons after stroke often have problems moving their affected arm, leading to limitations in performing simple tasks. In previous research in a group of 60 patients post stroke the investigators investigated two things: they observed how patients can move their affected arm, and the investigators asked patients to indicate how they think they can use their affected arm. Surprisingly, the investigators concluded that in patients with a similar, good observed arm use there were two groups: (1) a 'match' group, reporting they can use their arm well, and (2) a 'mismatch' group, reporting they can not use their arm well. This project will further investigate this last group. The investigators will now use sensor technology to investigate the actual daily life arm use during daily life. The investigators hypothesize this daily arm use will be lower in the mismatch group than in the group with good observed and perceived ability."
NCT02279940,"Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia and a major risk for ischemic stroke. Furthermore the risk of stroke is higher in the first month after transient ischemic attack (TIA)/stroke. Rivaroxaban has been approved by Health Canada over period of last two years for prevention of stroke and have been found equally effective as oral Vitamin K antagonist. The foremost benefits of NOAC are reduced intracranial bleeding risk and does not require coagulation monitoring.

Optimal timing of anticoagulation after TIA/stroke in patients with known non-valvular atrial fibrillation is not known. The practice is variable and opinion based. The bias for many stroke physicians and neurologists is to start later (after 1-2weeks) to prevent hemorrhagic transformation thus possibly exposing the patients to an increased risk of recurrence. The product monograph for the drug suggest to wait for variable of 3 to 14 days before starting the NOAC (Waiting period:14 days for dabigatran and rivaroxaban, 7 days for Apixaban after ischemic stroke and three days after TIA for rivaroxaban). The times have been chosen arbitrary.

The investigators aim to study incidence of symptomatic hemorrhage in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who are initiated with new oral anticoagulants early after TIA and stroke."
NCT03249844,"Arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) is a devastating condition, affecting 1.6-5/100,000 children/year. Although their outcome is different, children with stroke do not recover better than adults, with at least 2/3 suffering long term sequels such as developmental (motor, global intellectual, language...) and behavioral disabilities, epilepsy, and low adaptative and academic skills...

Stenotic cerebral arteriopathy is identified as AIS etiology in 60-80% of previously healthy children and the course of this arteriopathy is the strongest predictor of recurrent events. 30-40% of these children have a focal unilateral cerebral arteriopathy (FCA). Childhood FCA is suspected to be an inflammatory vessel wall pathology triggered by varicella and other (viral) infections. As recurrences occur for the great majority in the first 6 months after the index event, aspirin 5 mg/kg/day is recommended for at least 18 months to 2 years.

As there is a rational for using immunomodulatory drugs at the acute stage of FCA, immunotherapies are currently used by neuropaediatricians in AIS, mainly as steroids for children with stenosing arteriopathies. However, due to weak evidences, the literature cannot either encourage or discourage this practice.

The long term course of children with FCA is only approach to date by retrospective studies and controversies about outcome remain (for example, the recurrence risk on antithrombotic treatment varies notably from quasi zero to 25%). And finally, it is shown in childhood stroke, as well as in the global field of longstanding impairment, that parental and medical points of view do not match consistently. Longitudinal studies are needed to deserve this familial approach."

NCT02181062,"Stroke is a cruel disease that disproportionately kills and disables African-Americans, Latinos, Chinese-Americans and Korean-Americans; seniors with high blood pressure are at particularly high risk. There is a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in African Americans, Latinos, and Chinese Americans relative to non-Latino whites. Asian-Americans have up to 1.4 higher relative risk of stroke death compared to U.S. non-Latino whites. A critical need therefore exists for a sustainable and scalable mechanism to disseminate culturally-tailored stroke knowledge/prevention education in community-based settings where large numbers of these high-risk ethnic minority older adult groups are regularly served, such as in federally funded Multipurpose Senior Centers (MPCs) that exist across the nation (16 of which are in Los Angeles alone).

The overall objective of the proposed study is to develop and test the implementation of a training program for case managers at senior centers to implement a stoke knowledge/prevention education program among four high-risk ethnic minority older adult groups--Korean-American, Chinese-American, African-American, Latinos. We propose to develop a culturally-tailored case manager training curriculum, implement the training at 4 community-based sites, and evaluate the training model using a randomized wait-list controlled trial (n=244) testing the hypothesis that training case managers will decrease older adult participants' stroke risk in a sustainable fashion through increasing their preventative behavior (i.e. increasing their physical activity--mean steps/day--at 1 and 3 months).

Findings will inform similar community-academic partnership efforts around stroke and other disease-specific prevention research/interventions; they will also determine next steps in terms of whether this case manager-centric model can be scaled up and deployed in other community-based settings."

NCT01751854,"The information derived from this study will be critical to establishing appropriate rehabilitative interventions post-stroke. In particular, traditional use of pharmacological agents to alter motor function post-stroke is directed primarily at reducing the ""positive"" signs following upper motor neuron lesion, in particular spasticity, or enhanced, velocity-dependent stretch reflex responses to imposed stretch. While pharmacological management of spasticity certainly suppresses clinical and quantitative measures of hypertonia, there is little improvement in functional performance. In contrast, preliminary data on the administration of 5HT agents following neurological injury indicates an increase in motor performance (Pariente 2001) and recovery (Dam 1996), despite an increase in spastic motor activity (Stolp-Smith 1999; see Preliminary Data below). Understanding methods to maximize function following stroke despite potential, short-term increases in spastic motor activity may improve therapeutic intervention strategies. The general objective of this study is therefore to:

quantify the effects of short-term SSRI administration on voluntary and spastic motor behaviors in individuals with chronic spastic hemiparesis,
identify the changes in impairments and functional recovery of walking ability during BWSTT with the presence or absence of SSRIs."

NCT04271891,"Whole body periodic acceleration (WBPA) is a head-to-toe movement. The function WBPA works as adding pulses to the circulation. This motion increases shear stress to the endothelium, which stimulates increased release of endothelial-derived nitric oxide (eNO), prostaglandin E-2, tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) into the circulation, and these substances are cardioprotective and contribute to vasodilatation. The WBPA were not well studied than whole body vibration (WBV), a vertical rocking training machine, and most researches focused on cardioprotective effects. A study revealed the effect of Moderate-Intensity Exercise and Whole-Body Periodic Acceleration on Nitric Oxide release was the same. This instrument is quite safe and was applied to patients with varied diseases in previous study. No sound contraindication was mentioned till now.

NCT04180124,"In daily clinic, the use of treadmills to analyze the gait quality of a patient increases. The advantages of using a treadmill are that a smaller space is needed compared to a 3D lab for motion analysis, more steps can be recorded in shorter time period and patients should not start, stop or rotate during the analyses. One of the systems which can be used to perform motion analysis on a treadmill is the GRAIL. This GRAIL (Gait Real-time Analysis Interactive Lab) consists of an advanced treadmill with force sensors. Patients can walk on this treadmill with an imposed speed (fixed-speed) or at a speed determined by the patient itself (self-paced). Because not everyone is used to walk on a treadmill it is important to know if a person's walking pattern is different when he walks over ground compared to walking on the treadmill. Based on these insights, decisions can be made regarding interventions including treadmill training or this findings can be taking into account during further analysis of walking patterns on a treadmill. For this study stroke patients would be invited for an assessment on the treadmill (1 assessment moment). The movement pattern of these patients would be compared in different conditions:

(Forward and backward) Walking at comfortable walking speed on the GAITRite
Walking at comfortable walking speed on the treadmill in fixed speed mode
Walking at comfortable walking speed +0.2 m/s (faster walking) on the treadmill in fixed speed mode
Walking at comfortable walking speed on the treadmill in self-paced mode
Backward walking at comfortable walking speed on the treadmill in fixed speed mode (only if patients are eligible to do so)

Hypotheses based on this study protocol:

Do stroke patients walk different over ground compared to treadmill walking
Do stroke patients walk different during treadmill walking self-paced compared to fixed speed
Do stroke patients walk different during treadmill walking fixed speed comfortable walking speed compared to fast walking
Is there a correlation between upper extremity impairment and arm swing"
NCT03294187,"Stroke places a major burden on health care and society. It often leads to a hemiparesis. Intensive stroke rehabilitation speeds up recovery. In daily practice, the financial and/or human resources to provide this intensive rehabilitation are often lacking. Applying modern-day tracking and feedback technology to encourage a self-administered, context specific training is expected to offer significant potential to increase intensity of practice. Up until now, there has been no randomized trial examining the effect of such an intervention on daily arm usage.

The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of wearing an activity tracking and multimodal feedback device for six weeks on self-reported daily life use of the paretic arm after stroke, when compared to control group stroke subjects wearing a hardware-wise identical sham device providing no feedback. The secondary aim is to examine compliance to use the device and the quantitative, qualitative and functional improvement of the paretic arm. It is hypothesized that participants in the experimental group show a higher change in self-reported daily life use of the paretic arm when compared to the control group both post intervention and at 6-week follow-up.

NCT03974009,"Background:

Stroke is highly prevalence neurological condition and causing many disabilities worldwide. Impaired Balance, Gait disability and limited Range of motion are the major problems in the chronic stage of stroke. Taping technique increases the sense of proprioception and improves the accurate position of joint by limiting or facilitating the movements. Calcaneal taping technique helps to correct the determinants of gait, improvement of balance and ankle range of motion.

Aim:

The goal of the study is to verify the effect of calcaneal taping technique on balance, gait and range of motion in patients with chronic stroke.

Methods:

This randomized clinical trial study will recruit patients with chronic stroke (≥6 months) on the basis of selection criteria. Patients with age between 40-80 years and grade ≥ 2 of modified asworth scale for ankle joint will be included. Patients with any Cognition problems, balance disorders, any case of fracture and history of surgery in ankle, diabetic foot and neuropathic joints will be excluded from the study. Participants will be selected randomly by criterion based sampling method and will be allocated into two groups (experimental and control group).Experimental group will receive calcaneal taping and conventional therapy whereas control group will receive sham taping and conventional therapy.

NCT04442074,"Carotid diaphragms are a non-atheromatous arterial cause of cerebral infarction, especially in young people (≤65 years old). This anomaly is more common in the African or African-American population, although it is more and more often discovered in young Caucasians. This cause of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), known until the 1970s, was later forgotten until a recent revival of interest, probably in connection with the improvement of imagery but also by the discovery that these lesions have a high rate of recurrence in the absence of interventional care. In a Brazilian study, the carotid diaphragm was reported in 10% of patients under the age of 60.

The carotid diaphragm is a non-atheromatous overgrowth of the intima of the arterial wall. It appears in imagery in the form of an endoluminal web wider than it is tall. Its preferred seat is the carotid bulb. It is a source, by an embologenic mechanism, of cerebral infarction starting from local thrombus developed within large cerebral arteries. In histology, the lesions are different from atherosclerosis and characterized by a thickening of the intima with proliferation of loose and strewed spindle cells mainly involving the intima.

An atheromatous plaque or dissection with detachment of the intima are the two main differential diagnoses of the carotid web. However, the appearance of a diaphragm implanted on a regular wall and the absence of any other localization of atheroma distinguish the lesion of the carotid web from that of a focal atheromatous plate. In addition, the very proximal localization of the carotid web, from the emergence of the internal carotid artery, does not suggest a dissection, the localization of which is usually downstream of the bulb.

The baseline exam to detect a carotid diaphragm is a carotid angiography scan, but the abnormalities are often inconspicuous, making diagnosis difficult. We can be led in case of doubt to perform a conventional arteriography, which remains the ""gold standard"". The latter, dynamic examination compared to the CT scan, shows above all a stasis of blood flow in the recess created by the diaphragm, stasis at the origin of the formation of thrombi. It has been suspected that the maximum risk of infarction is upon waking, at the time of verticalization, with mobilization of the thrombus.

Therapeutically, the discovery of a symptomatic carotid diaphragm (ischemic swallowing accident) justifies radical treatment. The risk of recurrence of a patient on antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) being too high, it is proposed either surgery, or carotid angioplasty with stent placement. No comparative study of the 2 techniques has been carried out.

Besides radiological examinations, ultrasound is another technique for studying the cervical arteries. It is reputed to be of little contribution in the search for a carotid diaphragm, but few publications exist to date even though the cervical Doppler is often the first arterial examination carried out after an ischemic stroke. Two series reported Doppler ultrasound data in the carotid diaphragm. A recent retrospective study evaluated, in multimodal imaging [Doppler, CT scan of the Supra-Aortic Trunks (ASD) and conventional arteriography], 30 patients (60 carotids) with diaphragm or atherosclerosis. The correlation between conventional arteriography and CT angiography was perfect, but the correlation between Doppler and CT angiography for diaphragm diagnosis was moderate. In another series studying 15 diaphragms diagnosed by CT angiography, the retrospective analysis of doppler reports revealed that 40% were considered normal and 60% mentioned nonspecific hyperechoic lesions, but this work remained in the form of a presentation. at a congress. With the improvement of the technique and the resolution of the Doppler ultrasound as well as the knowledge of the particular ultrasound characteristics, it seems to us that this examination could regain a place in the diagnosis of the pathology. The carotid diaphragm is also largely unknown to vascular doctors practicing cervical Doppler ultrasound.

This descriptive study of the diagnostic contribution of the echo-doppler for a carotid diaphragm has for perspective the establishment of a prospective study of the contribution of a combined expertise angiologist-neurologist in the echo-Doppler for patients <60 years hospitalized for an ischemic stroke."
NCT04755959,"Cerebrovascular disease (stroke) is a leading cause of mortality and disability. Common risk assessment tools for stroke are based on the Framingham equation, which relies on traditional cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoking, atrial fibrillation). These risk assessment tools calculate the likelihood for a general vascular ""event"" such as stroke and myocardial infarction in the near decade, but do not assess the risk for an impending event although that would enable taking immediate preventive action (e.g. anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation; control of hypertension). Covert cerebrovascular disease is linked to subtle cognitive and motor deficits and increased risk for stroke. We hypothesize that it is possible to identify subjects with impending stroke based on their internet communication features 0-12 months prior to the actual occurrence of acute clinical stroke. Based on this we have previously developed an internet-based algorithm that accurately identifies people at risk of stroke through cognitive changes manifested in their search queries. The purpose of this study is to validate the model and train a new model by analyzing Google queries of patients hospitalized in the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center with stroke.

NCT03582397,"Mirror box therapy is a treatment option that has shown promise for people with difficulty moving their arm after a brain injury, such as stroke. During mirror box therapy, people place their affected arm inside a box, where they are unable to see it. They then focus their attention on the outside of the box, which has been fitted with a mirror. The mirror reflects the movements of their intact hand and makes it appear that both hands are moving normally. Research has shown that this type of therapy can help people recover some use of the arm.

This study is designed to examine a new type of treatment, which uses a virtual reality headset (Oculus Rift) to recreate this effect in a virtual environment. Up to twenty people who have had a stroke and now have difficulty using an arm (Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity range 10-50) will be asked to come in for four weeks of treatment, during which they will perform a set of movements and games using the virtual reality platform, while focusing on the image of their affected arm. Treatment will include two fifteen minute sessions, three times/week for a period of four weeks. Participants will complete pre-testing, which will provide a baseline measure of performance, and post-testing, to see if the treatment has been well-tolerated and has had any impact on their motor performance.

This research is important because it may demonstrate the usefulness of a new treatment method for people who have suffered a stroke, or generally demonstrate that virtual reality platforms may be useful treatment tools for stroke survivors. It may also provide a relatively low-cost and motivating rehabilitation tool for use in the hospital or home environment outside of therapy hours."

NCT03731351,"Stroke remains the leading cause of disability in the United States. An estimated 40-50% of all ischemic strokes are caused by large-vessel occlusion of a major cerebral artery (LVO). However, in some cases, the occlusion results in mild symptoms, at least initially, and these patients frequently do not receive any treatment. These strokes, however, may result in unfavorable long-term outcomes despite relatively benign initial course. Recent large randomized studies in patients with severe stroke symptoms and associated LVO showed efficacy and safety of endovascular mechanical thrombectomy, but patients with mild symptoms were not specifically addressed.

Based on the investigators' own data and limited evidence in the literature, the investigators propose that early mechanical thrombectomy in patients with LVO associated with mild stroke symptoms (defined as NIHSS ≤ 5) is safe, and results in favorable long-term patient outcomes.

The objective of this prospective pilot study is to assess the safety and outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy in patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke due to a large vessel occlusion in the anterior or posterior circulation under 24 hours with mild symptoms (NIHSS ≤ 5)."
NCT02185885,"STUDY HYPOTHESIS

In cardiac surgery the volume of perioperative cerebral infarctions can be reduced by increasing mean arterial pressure (MAP) during the cardiopulmonary bypass procedure.

BRIEF STUDY SUMMARY

Heart surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) can be complicated by injury to the brain. Previous studies using brain scans have reported small stroke-like lesions in up to 51% of patients after cardiac surgery. However, only 1-6 % of patients have permanent symptoms of severe brain damage.

The majority of brain lesions seem to be caused by particulate matter (emboli) that wedge in blood vessels of the brain thereby compromising flow. In addition, insufficient blood flow to areas of the brain supplied by narrowed, calcified vessels may contribute. MAP during CPB usually stabilizes below the lower limit of cerebral autoregulation, which is accepted since sufficient total blood flow is guaranteed during CPB.

The aim of the PPCI trial is to investigate if increased MAP during CPB can prevent or reduce the extent of brain injury after cardiac surgery. A beneficial effect could result from reduced embolic injury through increased blood flow in collateral vessels and/or by increased blood flow in calcified arteries.

180 patients scheduled for cardiac surgery will be randomly allocated to increased MAP (70-80 mm Hg) or 'usual practice' (typically 45-50 mm Hg) during CPB, whereas CPB blood flow is intended equal and fixed in the two groups. Patients are examined before and 3-6 days after surgery with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans, mental tests and by blood borne markers of brain injury.

If higher MAP during CPB is beneficial, a change of practice can easily be implemented in the clinical routine."
NCT03296852,"The purpose of this research study is to test a new medical device, called SONAS.

NCT05320549,"Physical activity is known to be beneficial for supporting health and wellbeing. A number of schemes and strategies have been developed to improve uptake of physical activity in the United Kingdom (UK) population, including the 'Everybody active, every day' framework. This framework includes recommendations for referral from a healthcare professional for people to become more active. For those with an existing health condition or other risk factors that could lead to health problems, such referrals may be to an 'exercise referral scheme' (ERS). However, there are often limited opportunities for individuals diagnosed with stroke and/or a Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA to engage in rigorously monitored, exercise and behaviour change opportunities once they have been discharged from the National Health Service (NHS). In Winchester, General Practitioners (GPs) refer approximately 10 to 20 stroke/TIA patients to the Winchester City Council led exercise referral scheme each year, despite the local trust (Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; HHFT) diagnosing approx. 1000 cases each year. With limited time and resources for GPs to effectively refer eligible patients to the programme, greater engagement with NHS hospitals may be necessary to increase the referral and uptake of such programmes. Accordingly, the Health Enhancing Lifestyle Programme (HELP) Hampshire Stroke Clinic (www.helphampshire.co.uk) was launched in March 2019 and provides individuals who have experienced a stroke with various community-based, accessible, group-focused exercise opportunities. Referrals primarily come from consultants, physiotherapists and occupational therapists from HHFT.

NCT05113043,"The relationship between the intestinal microecology and stroke has become a research hotspot in neurology field today. Maintaining the balance of the intestinal microbiota are expected to bring new breakthroughs for prevention and treatment of stroke. In recent years, stroke in young adults has an increasing incidence and a considerable socioeconomic impact because of high disability rate and health-care costs. So there is an urgent need to explore the role and mechanism of intestinal microecology imbalance in stroke, especially in the development and prognosis of stroke in young people. This study aims to use multi-omics technologies, including microbial diversity, metagenomics and metabonomics, to reveal the characteristics of intestinal flora in young stroke patients, identify biomarkers for predicting outcome after stroke and early detection of young people at high risk of stroke, and to further explore the role of gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of stroke."
NCT05370105,"The combination of rehabilitation protocols and regenerative therapies offers the outstanding opportunity to promote and enhance the endogenous regenerative and repair processes occurring in tissues damaged or lost due to injury, disease, or age. Still, one of the main hurdles in the clinical approach to regenerative rehabilitation is the lack of easily accessible and sensitive biomarkers for the evaluation of rehabilitation and therapy efficacy. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoscaled vesicles that mediate intercellular communication among organs. EVs were shown to be involved in the onset, progression and resolution of many disorders, being also used as valuable tool in the regenerative medicine field. However, the initial enthusiastic approach to EVs has been hindered in its transfer to clinics because of technological obstacles related to their dimensions and to their limited amount. The present project proposes the application of a Surface Plasmon Resonance imaging (SPRi)-based biosensor for the detection and characterization of blood EVs from stroke patients, before and after rehabilitation. After the successful SPRi detection of EVs of different cellular origin (brain and non-brain cells), the quantification of specific surface molecules related to pathological or regeneration processes will be accomplished. If successful, the project will 1) demonstrate the ability of the SPRi biosensor to reveal differences in the relative amount of specific cell-derived EV subpopulations and in their cargo during disease progression and rehabilitation induced recovery, 2) provide support for using the proposed SPRi-based biosensor for the detection and characterization of circulating EVs in order to evaluate the efficacy of rehabilitation protocols and regenerative therapies, 3) identify new biomarkers for the profiling of stroke patients to personalize the rehabilitation therapies."

Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that PFO closure is associated with a 59% relative risk reduction in the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. As such, the number of PFO closure procedures are expected to increase substantially in the upcoming years. Real world data (RWD) informing on the medical management, the risk of stroke recurrence, incident atrial fibrillation, and other outcomes in stroke patients with PFO, with and without PFO closure, will become crucial for understanding how results from RCTs are translated into clinical practice globally.

NCT02951338,"It is important for people with stroke to exercise in order to improve their overall recovery and general health. However, these individuals are less physically active than people without stroke, and they often do not achieve the recommended frequency, intensity or duration of exercise. Low levels of physical activity leads to people with stroke becoming very unfit, which can result in functional decline and increased difficulty being active. It is important to determine how to encourage people with stroke to be more active in the long-term. The transition time between the end of rehabilitation and return to the community might be an ideal time to address barriers, and to develop positive habits, knowledge and abilities for long-term participation in exercise. We developed the PROPEL program that combines exercise with self-management strategies during rehabilitation to promote physical activity after rehabilitation. Preliminary pilot findings indicate that people who completed PROPEL were more physically active after discharge than those who did not. This study aims to evaluate the effect of PROPEL on long-term participation in exercise after discharge from stroke rehabilitation. This study will take place at 6 different hospitals. Participants will either complete a control intervention (group exercise only) or the PROPEL intervention (group exercise plus self-management). Participants' adherence to exercise for 6 months after the end of the interventions will be evaluated using activity and heart rate monitors and physical activity questionnaires. We expect this study will show that a simple intervention delivered during rehabilitation will increase participation in exercise after rehabilitation. Increased participation in exercise could then lead to improved stroke recovery and overall health, and reduced risk of having another stroke."

NCT04116671,"Objective: The goal of this study is to implement and test a neuro-mechanical gait assist (NMGA) device to correct walking characterized by muscle weakness, incoordination or excessive tone in Veterans with hemiparesis after stroke that adversely affects their ability to walk, exercise, perform activities of daily living, and participate fully in personal, professional and social roles.

Research Plan: A prototype NMGA device will be used to develop a finite state controller (FSC) to coordinate each user's volitional effort with surface muscle stimulation and motorized knee assistance as needed. Brace mounted sensors will be used to develop a gait event detector (GED) which will serve the FSC to advance through the phases of gait or stair climbing. In addition, a rule-base intent detection algorithm will be developed using brace mounted sensors and user interface input to select among various functions including walking, stairs climbing, sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit maneuvers. The FSC controller tuning and intent algorithm development and evaluation will be on pilot subjects with difficulty walking after stroke. Outcome measures during development will provide specifications for a new prototype NMGA design which will be evaluated on pilot subjects to test the hypothesis that the NMGA improves walking speed, distance and energy consumption of walking. These baseline data and device will be used to design a follow-up clinical trial to measure orthotic impact of NMGA on mobility in activities of daily living at home and community.

Methodology: After meeting inclusion criteria, pilot subjects will undergo baseline gait evaluation with EMG activities of knee flexors and extensors, ankle plantar and dorsiflexors and isokinetic knee strength and passive resistance. They will be fitted with a NMGA combining a knee-ankle-foot-orthosis with a motorized knee joint and surface neuromuscular stimulation of plantar- and dorsi- flexors, vasti and rectus femoris. Brace mounted sensor data will be used for gait event detector (GED) algorithm development and evaluation. The GED will serve the FSC to proceed through phases of gait based on supervisory rule-based user intent recognition algorithm detected by brace mounted sensors and user input interface. The FSC will coordinate feed-forward control of tuned stimulation patterns and closed-loop controlled knee power assist as needed to control foot clearance during swing and stability of the knee during stance. Based on data attained during controller development and evaluation, a new prototype NMGA will be design, constructed and evaluated on pilot subjects to test the hypothesis that a NMGA device improves safety and stability, increases walking speed and distance and minimizes user effort.

Clinical Significance: The anticipated outcome is improved gait stability with improved swing knee flexion, thus, increasing the safety and preventing injurious falls of ambulatory individuals with hemiplegia due to stroke found in large and ever-increasing numbers in the aging Veteran population. Correcting gait should lead to improved quality of life and participation."
NCT00061373,"Ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks the flow of blood to the brain and damages brain cells. The clot, or thrombus, is made up of platelets and fibrin. The medicine alteplase, also known as tPA , is the standard drug used to treat patients with acute ischemic stroke. tPA attacks the fibrin portion of the blood clot. While intravenous (iv) tPA alone is effective in treating the fibrin part of the clot approximately 30% of the time, adding other commercially available drugs such eptifibatide to treat other clot components may improve the effectiveness of iv tPA therapy.

This is a clinical trial to determine an acceptable dose of eptifibatide in combination with aspirin, the low molecular weight heparin tinzaparin, and standard iv tPA therapy for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Use of clinical and imaging based selection criteria are hypothesized to contribute to treatment safety by selecting patients at lower risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. Also,selection and evaluation of patients by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) criteria will result in a different risk to benefit ratio than selecting patients without MRI criteria and will lead to a different acceptable dose."
NCT04219696,"Falls in daily life are one of the most significant complications for people with stroke. Fall rates are particularly high soon after discharge from stroke rehabilitation. A new type of balance training, called reactive balance training (RBT), can reduce fall rates after discharge from stroke rehabilitation. In our previous study, RBT was implemented as part of routine care, and as a result, the dose of training was different for each participant; participants completed between one and twelve 30-minute sessions of RBT. Previous research in healthy older adults suggests that a single session of RBT is enough to lead to lasting changes in reactive balance control and reduce fall rates in daily life. It is not clear if the same is true for people with stroke, who have more severe impairments and might need a higher dose of training to achieve the same benefits.

The overall goal of this work is to determine the optimal dose of reactive balance training for people with stroke who are attending rehabilitation. This pilot study will determine the feasibility of a clinical trial to address this larger goal. People with sub-acute stroke will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1 session, 3 sessions, or 6 sessions of RBT. Each session will be 45 minutes long, and will occur as part of participants' routine out-patient rehabilitation. We will use our experiences with this pilot study to help design a larger study. Specifically, we will use this pilot study to answer the following questions: 1) what is the optimal sample size; 2) how long will it take to reach this sample size; 3) what outcome measures should be used; 4) how feasible is it to prescribe a specific dose of RBT to people with sub-acute stroke; and 5) what two intervention groups should be included in the larger trial?"
NCT03170791,"This study will find out whether electrical stimulation of a nerve called the ""vagus"" nerve is acceptable for patients undergoing physiotherapy for arm weakness after a stroke. 20 patients will be recruited if they had a stroke between 4 and 48 months previously and have been left with reduced function in the affected arm. Patients will receive 3 sessions of physiotherapy per week for 6 weeks. Each session will last 1 hour during which the patient will be asked to perform specific movements e.g. shuffling cards, reaching for a shelf. With each arm movement the therapist will turn on a stimulator which is worn clipped to the patients ear. This will deliver a short burst of electricity creating a mild tingling sensation.

At the end of the session, the stimulator will be removed and the patient will be asked to rate the level of any discomfort or fatigue they experienced as well as any other side effects. The therapist will also record whether the stimulator device interfered with the therapy in any way. A heart tracing will be performed at each visit to check the heart rhythm. At the start and end of the 6 week course of physiotherapy, patients arm weakness and level of arm function will be assessed, as well as their general levels of fatigue, mood and quality of life. These will be reassessed at 1 month and 6 months after the course of physiotherapy has ended. The investigators will also interview patients to establish how they found the treatment itself. If the vagal nerve stimulation combined with physiotherapy is acceptable to patients and therapists and there are no safety concerns, the investigators will plan a larger trial of this treatment in stroke patients."

Thrombolysis with the clot-busting drug alteplase is effective for acute ischaemic stroke, provided that it is given within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Patients with wake-up stroke are currently ineligible for clot-busting therapy. Previous studies indicate that many wake-up strokes occur just before awakening.

In this study, patients with wake-up stroke will be randomized to thrombolysis with tenecteplase and best standard treatment or to best standard treatment without thrombolysis. Tenecteplase has several potential advantages over alteplase, including very rapid action and that it can be given as a single injection. Prior to thrombolysis, a brain scan must be done to exclude bleeding or significant brain damage as a result from the stroke. We will use a CT scan to inform this decision. CT is used as a routine examination in all stroke patients. Other studies testing clot-busting treatment in wake-up stroke are using alteplase and more complex brain scans, which are not routinely available in the emergency situation in all hospitals."

NCT05004389,"Prediction of walking recovery after stroke can inform patient-centered care and support discharge planning. The accuracy of current prediction models is limited, however, due to small study designs and narrow predictors assessed. The investigators propose a comprehensive evaluation of a novel combination of biomarkers to improve prediction of walking recovery and guide rehabilitation efforts after stroke. These include acute structural brain network disruption (utilizing MRI); blood biomarker levels (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor and vascular endothelial growth factor); and clinical assessments of strength and mobility. The overall study objectives are to assess protocol feasibility and investigate relationships between select biomarkers and walking recovery to provide strong justification for a larger study on predictors of independent walking after stroke. The proposed objectives will be pursued through the following specific aims: 1) Assess feasibility of a larger study and develop methods for telehealth data collection; 2) Establish baseline levels of biomarkers and average change over time; and 3) Elucidate relationships between baseline levels of biomarkers and walking gains across time in persons after stroke. A longitudinal, observational study design will be utilized for this study. Thirty-five persons with acute (≤7 days) stroke will be recruited from the local medical center. Select inclusion criteria include presence of new lower limb weakness and assistance for walking; select exclusion criteria include cerebellar stroke or other neurological disorders such as Parkinson's Disease. Subjects will undergo clinical evaluation at week 1, 4, 9, 12, and 26 weeks post-stroke. MRI scans will occur within 12 days post-stroke and at 12 weeks post-stroke, and blood draws within 1 week, 1 to 2 weeks and at 12 weeks post-stroke. To assess feasibility the investigators will examine study processes, recruitment, resources, study management, and scientific assessment. To examine the role of acute clinical, neuroimaging, and physiological measures in predicting walking recovery, the investigators will examine relationships between these measures and walking outcome at 12-weeks post-stroke. The proposed research is expected to provide strong scientific support for future clinical trials designed to target therapies based on predicted functional potential. Such knowledge has the potential of enhancing mobility gains and patient independence following stroke."

NCT03784534,"As with other real=world connected systems, studying the network structure of multiple interactions in the brain (holism versus reductionism) has profound implications in the comprehension of emergent complex phenomena like, for example, the capability to functionally reorganize after cerebrovascular ""attacks"" or stroke. This dynamic skill, which is known in neuroscience as brain plasticity, is not only interesting from a network perspective, but it also plays a crucial role in determining the motor/cognitive recovery of patients who survive a stroke.

Network analysis of functional connectivity (FC) patterns estimated from neuroimaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has allowed a major breakthrough in the understanding of physiopathology of stroke from a system perspective. Recent evidence from cross=sectional studies1,2 highlights that stroke lesions generally induce i) critical deviation from optimal (i.e. small=world) network topologies supporting both segregated and integrated information processing, ii) altered inter=hemispheric connectivity and modularity, iii) and abnormal region centrality in the ipsilesional hemisphere as well as in the contralesional hemisphere. While these findings provide new descriptors on how stroke lesions affect the functional brain network organization and how this correlates with the resulting behavioral impairment (e.g. hemiplegia, aphasia), they only represent a static picture of the brain plasticity, which is instead intrinsically dynamic, and partially inform on the chances of single patients to recover their motor/cognitive functions. These aspects dramatically limit the investigator's ability to fully understand the brain organizational mechanisms after stroke and to probe the predictive power of possible network=based neuromarkers of recovery. The ATTACK project aims to overcome these technological and methodological barriers by implementing the following three=fold strategy:

acquiring a longitudinal dataset of brain and behavioral data in stroke patients and healthy controls,
developing new analytic tools to characterize and generate temporally dynamic brain networks,
building network=based models of functional recovery after stroke, accounting for individual patients."

The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the viability, safety and efficacy of hemodialysis in patients with acute ischemic stroke, proposing that it may have a) a potential neuroprotective effect by reducing the excitotoxic levels of glutamate and proinflammatory cytokines in blood and b) fewer technical problems than peritoneal dialysis to apply in usual clinical practice."
NCT03728738,"Placing the head of bed (HOB) at 0-degrees has been shown in small studies to improve blood flow to the brain in patients with ischemic stroke caused by large artery occlusions, thereby reducing stroke symptom worsening. This simple yet potentially impactful intervention has yet to be tested in a large clinical trial in hyperacute large artery ischemic stroke patients, but may provide nurses with a powerful contribution to acute stroke care that is capable of preventing worsening of stroke symptoms and promoting stabilization. Because stroke is the leading cause of preventable long-term disability in adults, this study may show that simple methods such as 0-degree HOB positioning should be considered one of the very first actions taken in the emergent management of acute ischemic stroke patients."

NCT01079728,"Stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) constitutes a clinically relevant complication of stroke, because it increases the mortality and has a negative impact on the neurological prognosis of the patient.

An early identification of patients at risk for SAP allowing an early initiation of antiinfective therapy may improve the prognosis. To date, no reliable prediction models or clinical scores for stroke-associated pneumonia exist. Recently, it was shown that parameters indicating an impaired immune function are associated with the subsequent occurrence of SAP and could therefore be used as predictors for SAP.

This study will develop and prospectively validate a prognostic score to predict SAP based on clinical parameters. Furthermore, the study examines the prognostic properties of selected immune and infectious parameters for the prediction and diagnosis of SAP. The study will further address the question whether these infectious and immune parameters predict the 3-month-outcome. In a subgroup of patients, MRI parameters on stroke size and localization will be assessed to investigate whether these parameters might allow prediction of SAP or the 3-month-outcome."

This may reduce a patient's quality of life.

Many innovative therapy techniques have been developed to help the restoration of lost functions and to aid in prevention and treatment of depression. Music and art therapy has been used in rehabilitation settings to stimulate brain functions involved in movement, cognition, speech, emotions, and sensory perceptions. However many research studies on the use of music and art therapy in rehabilitation of acquired brain injury have suffered from small sample size, making it difficult to achieve statistically significant results.

In addition, stroke patients who have higher visual dependence may not have the symptom of dizziness. Therefore, it is unclear whether visual adaption training has similar effects on stroke patients. Visual dependence is considered as a sensory reweighting deficit and therefore visual dependence could be improved through multisensory balance training which comprises of visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive manipulation.

NCT01498705,"Approximately 12% of strokes in the United States are hemorrhagic.1 Hemorrhagic stroke can lead to multiple complications including fever that is not infectious. Identifying the cause of fever can help physicians choose the best care for the patient to try and prevent further damage to the already injured brain. Bacterial infection is one possible cause of fever in the stroke patient; however an incorrect diagnosis of infection can lead to unnecessary antibiotic use. Better screening tools for infection are being developed to help fight the problem of antibiotic resistance and unnecessary antibiotic use. Unnecessary use of antibiotics in patients increases the risk of adverse events and overall healthcare costs. Procalcitonin (PCT) is one such screening tool which has been used previously to help tell apart bacterial and nonbacterial causes of infection in other disease states; however, PCT has not been studied in hemorrhagic stroke patients. The purpose of this study is to understand the progress of PCT in hemorrhagic stroke patients in order to see whether PCT can be a useful marker for infection in these patients."

The UE subscale of Fugl-Meyer assessment (UE-FMA) and Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) as primary outcome measures were assessed at beginning of the intervention, after 3-week of treatment, and one-month follow-up. No significant differences in the primary outcome measures at post-treatment and one-month follow-up were found among the tDCS combined with NMES group (n=9), tDCS combined with sham NMES group (n=9), and the sham tDCS combined with sham NMES group (n=8). However, significant changes in UE-FMA (from baseline to post-treatment, p= .02) and ARAT (from baseline to post-treatment, p= .04) score were found for the tDCS combined with NMES group. This preliminary study reveals that the tDCS combined with NMES appears to be beneficial to UE motor recovery after stroke but is not superior to the tDCS alone."

NCT01558232,"The objective of this clinical study is to examine acute changes in stability, force allocation, work, and mobility from using a wearable, portable, battery-operated robotic orthosis (the Tibion Bionic Leg) in subacute post-stroke persons undergoing lower extremity physical therapy."
NCT01560520,"Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in Europe and United States and the second leading cause of death worldwide and affects more than 10,000 Danes each year.

Studies in a late and stationary phase after stroke have shown that physical rehabilitation is of great importance for survival and physical ability of these patients, however many studies show that patients lie or sit next to their bed under hospitalization for more than 88.5 % of the daily hours. Physical activity in stroke patients has never previously been measured immediately after debut of symptoms; furthermore there is no knowledge about the optimal dose of physical rehabilitation for these patients.

Accelerometers, small measuring devices, are a relatively new way to measure physical activity precisely, and hence it is possible to obtain an objective measure of how active stroke patients are in the first week after admission. The accelerometers measure a variable voltage, depending on the range and intensity of movement. They can measure movement dependent of the placement of the accelerometer, for instance over the hip, arm or leg. Studies confirm their reliability, even in patients with abnormal gait, such as stroke patients.

Another approach of studying the effects of physical activity and rehabilitation is through the examination of biomarkers. Studies have shown that biomarkers released during physical activity can inhibit biomarkers released after tissue injury in the brain, as seen after stroke. These brain biomarkers cause further damage and studies show that the higher the levels, the higher the damage. It is therefore obvious to examine whether physical activity rehabilitation can down regulate this destructive process in patients with stroke.

Clarification of physical activity in stroke patients immediately after debut of symptoms and examination of both the biochemical aspects of physical rehabilitation as well as the optimal dose of physical rehabilitation is of great importance for many patients, their relatives as well as of a great socioeconomic importance.

The purpose of the project is to describe the amount and pattern of physical activity in stroke patients in the first week after admission. The investigators hypothesis is that patients are inactive for most of the time during hospitalization, activity being correlated with severity of stroke, but not with age, BMI and sex."
NCT03977506,"Precise recommendations concerning the methods of evaluation for the resumption of the driving after a not evolutionary stroke were recommended recently by the High Authority of Health. These describe among others elements to be estimated during the test on the road, in the presence of the driving instructor who remains Gold standard.

However, no standardized assessment grid serving as decision-making tool is at present validated.

Actually the test made by the unit of evaluation of the automobile resumption of the university hospital on the road, in a car of apprenticeship with double pedals and in the presence of a professional binomial (driving instructor and occupational therapist) then validated by the opinion of the doctor of the service. The current standard is thus very subjective and lack of sensibility.

It is necessary to study the metrological properties of both available assessment grids (that established from the recommendations of the HAS and TRIP), none of them reached a level of validation enough in this population.

The TRIP is this day validated only at the elderly people. The hypothesis of the search is an insufficiency of TRIP to estimate the patients presenting aftereffects of cerebrovascular accident.

The main objective of this work is to validate the new assessment grid after a study of its metrological properties in the situation of the driving on the road."
NCT01570920,Chronic stroke patients (>6 months) fulfilling including criteria were trained during 3 months. The physical training program was based on walking.
NCT01573585,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether FAST (Fast muscle Activation and Stepping Training) exercises will improve walking balance in individuals after stroke to a greater extent than usual care.

Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis is that improvements in walking balance will be larger following 12 sessions of FAST exercise retraining compared to usual care in persons in the sub-acute phase after stroke."
NCT01574495,"This is a sub-project of a larger NIDRR Grant. One promising form of robotic training that leverages the power of neuro-plasticity is error augmentation. In this paradigm the computer singles out and magnifies a stroke survivor's movement errors from a desired trajectory, thus forcing the subjects to strengthen their control. Using the VRROOM, a state-of-the-art system which uses haptics (robotic forces) and graphics (visual display) interfaces, a subject's desired trajectory can be determined and the movement errors can be amplified in real-time with dramatic results. This project evaluates a practical approach of error augmentation, using therapist-driven trajectories. The investigators intend to determine clinical efficacy of several types of therapist-assisted error augmentation on retraining the nervous system in functional activities. The investigators will test two experimental treatments in a crossover design. The investigators hypothesize that combined haptic and visual error augmentation will lead to the best functional recovery."

NCT01574599,The purpose of this study is to assess whether a novel therapy approach (repetitive facilitative exercise (RFE)) is more effective than conventional rehabilitation in facilitating the recovery of upper extremity function following stroke.
NCT01582620,"The purpose is to study the clinical, technological and organizational impacts of a telestroke service between Nordlandssykehuset, Bodø, and two small rural hospitals in Lofoten and Vesterålen. The stroke specialist in Bodø will examine the patient in cooperation with the doctor at the local hospital through video- and sound communication. Radiology images are transmitted using the RIS/PACS system.

Telestroke consultations may be useful to assess whether the patient needs thrombolysis medication, and also whether there is a need for more advanced specialist neurological or neurosurgical treatment, supporting quick triaging and transfer to the appropriate unit.

The study design is a multi-method approach using before-and-after hospital information data as well as registration forms monitoring patient outcome and pathways. The research questions will be approached from medical, organisational and technological perspectives.

A telestroke service in North Norway is expected to face other challenges than those reported internationally: In Nordlandssykehuset, as in Helse Nord in general, the number of cases is low, clinicians have high turnover, technical support is not available 24/7 and severe weather conditions and long distances might add to the transport time.

Primary hypothesis: The use of telestroke leads to faster and more accurate diagnosis and proper treatment

Secondary hypothesis: Telestroke leads to improved overall patient treatment"
NCT01575366,"Aim 1. Determine whether higher-velocity finger tracking training improves hand function more than slower velocity training. Working hypotheses: The higher-velocity training will have significantly greater functional improvement compared to the lower-velocity training, as measured by standardized upper extremity functional tests (Jebsen Taylor test, Box & Block Test, and Finger extension force test)

Aim 2. Ascertain whether higher-velocity finger tracking training differentially induces cortical reorganization as compared to lower-velocity finger tracking training.

Working hypotheses: The higher-velocity training will have significantly greater cortical reorganization compared to the lower-velocity training, as measured by:

TMS - increased amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEP) from paretic extensor digitorum muscle in response to paired-pulse TMS to ipsilesional primary motor area (M1).
fMRI - increased volume of activation, signal intensity, and laterality of ipsilesional M1.

Aim 3. Explore whether the functional improvements correlate with the cortical reorganization. Working hypotheses: The functional improvements will correlate with the cortical reorganization."
NCT03171272,"The most commonly observed sequel after stroke is muscle weakness, which can also be identified in respiratory muscles, in the acute and chronic phases, and may compromise the lung function of these individuals. Studies have shown that lower Pimax values are found in non-community ambulators, and gait velocity has been reported as an important indicator of functionality after stroke, with higher gait velocity values associated with greater community participation and better quality of life.

This study will test the hypothesis that training of the inspiratory muscles is effective in improving strength and endurance of the inspiratory muscles and functionality, including speed of gait, functional gait perfomarnce, activities of daily living and quality of life with stroke subjects.

For this clinical trial, people after stroke will be randomly allocated into either experimental or control/sham groups. The experimental group will undertake training of the inspiratory muscles with the Power Breath Medical Classic device regulated at 50% of the subjects' maximal inspiratory pressure values, five times/week over six weeks, twice a day for 15 minutes, totaling 30 minutes/day. The control group will undertake the same protocol, but the participants will receive the devices with a minimal load, wich corresponds to 1cmH2O. Both groups will participate in the rehabilitation program for 6 weeks. At baseline and post intervention, after the cessation of the interventions, researchers blinded to group allocations will collect the following outcome measures: maximal respiratory pressures, respiratory muscle endurance, functional gait performance, activities of daily living and quality of life. After 12 weeks will collect again maximal inspiratory pressures and functional gait performance."
NCT01584180,"Mild hypothermia improves outcome in patients with global cerebral ischemia after cardiac arrest. Hypothermia seems promising also in other acute hypoxic-ischemic or in brain swelling associated cerebrovascular disease. The narrow-time-frame is a major issue (""time is brain""). To provide immediate cooling without delay, easy to use, mobile and effective methods are needed. Cold infusions (4 °C) are an accepted standard worldwide. EMCOOLS Brain.Pad (Emergency Medical Cooling Systems AG, Wien, Austria) is a new non-invasive surface cooling system. A comparison of these two induction methods has never been done before. Neither was the effect of the EMCOOLS Brain.Pad on brain-temperature measured. For the first time iCOOL 3 compares feasibility, safety and efficacy of the two methods."
NCT01600391,"Given that visual information comprises one of the most important and salient sources of information used during walking, that visual cues have been shown to be more effective than auditory cues in triggering gait adjustments and that stroke survivors have been reported to become more dependent on visual cues, the investigators hypothesize that visual cues would be more effective in triggering gait recovery and adaptability following stroke than interventions not including visual cues.

The investigators will integrate visual cues with walking and turning practice, and contrast this intervention to routine overground walking practice. Stroke participants recruited from NHS stroke rehabilitation clinics in the West Midlands, will be randomized to one of three gait rehabilitation groups. Each group will receive the same frequency and duration of treatment delivered by qualified physiotherapists. Overground visual cue training (OVCT) and usual care (UC) groups will be treated in participating NHS sites. Treadmill training with visual cues (TVCT) will take place at the University of Birmingham."

Forty patients with subacute ischemic stroke will randomly assigned to one of three groups: Anodal, Cathodal and Sham. Each group will receive tDCS at an intensity of 2mA for 25 minutes daily for 6 consecutive days over the affected (Anodal, Sham) or unaffected (Cathodal) motor cortex. Patients will be assessed with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), the Barthel index (BI) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle strength scale at baseline, after end of the 6th tDCS session, and then 1, 2 and 3 months later. Motor cortical excitability will be measured at baseline and after the 6th session in both hemispheres."
NCT01618123,"It is recognized that endothelial dysfunction is a major factor contributing to the atherogenic process. Abnormal function of the endothelium is detectable prior to obvious intimal lesions in patients with risk factors for atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction is a systemic disorder and a key variable in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and its complications. Measurement of peripheral vasodilator response with fingertip peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) technology (EndoPAT; Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel) is emerging as a useful method for assessing vascular function. EndoPAT may be a potential valid test increasing the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for detection of subjects to chest pain unit (CPU) with chest pain but no obvious coronary artery disease (CAD). This is a relatively fast non-invasive bedside test, relatively low-cost and has no side effects. Therefore, the primary objective of the study is to test the hypothesis that abnormal endothelial function as assessed by EndoPAT testing will increase the prediction of the short (in-hospital) and long-term (1-year) outcome of patients presenting to the chest pain unit."
NCT01617343,"Spatial neglect represents one of the major cognitive disorders following stroke. Patients patients fail to be aware of objects or people to their left and orientate instead to their right side. Enduring neglect has been found to be a poor prognostic indicator for functional independence following stroke. Despite some promising experimental accounts there are no established treatments for this condition.

The aim of this study is to test whether a combined treatment with hemifield eye patching (HEP) and optokinetic stimulation (OKS) can permanently reduce neglect behaviour and improve functional outcome in patients with hemispatial neglect following stroke.

The investigators hypothesise that the treatment with HEP and OKS will lead to a greater reduction of neglect scoring in the neglect test battery as well as a greater improvement in functional independence scores as compared to the spontaneous clinical course of the usual-care control group."

This pilot study will examine the effect of renal nerve denervation in patients with treatment resistant hypertension after ischemic stroke or DWI/DTI-verified stroke. With 24 hours blood pressure measurements the effect after renal nerve denervation is examined 1,3,6 and 12 months after the procedure."
NCT01622205,"Stroke is a generic term for cerebral infarction and cerebral haemorrhage and accounts for more patient days than any other single condition in Swedish health care. The Swedish guidelines for stroke treatment, issued by the national board for health and welfare, recommend early supported discharge for people with mild to moderate stroke. This is based on studies in which mean hospitalization was 18 days. The average length of stay in Sweden is 12 days. Policy makers would, however, like to shorten length of stay even further, and many patients are anxious to get home. Where and how to get support at home after discharge varies.

This study is a randomized controlled trial in which half of the subjects are randomly allocated to very early supported discharge and the other half receives usual treatment. The investigators believe that patients discharged very early with support will experience less anxiety compared with controls. The investigators believe that early supported discharge is safe and that there is no difference between groups in bodily function. In order to test differences between the groups, the study requires approximately 110 subjects.

Everyone who comes to the stroke unit at the hospital with a mild to moderate stroke can be recruited to the study. The intervention is having a team from the stroke unit visiting the patient's home and train him/her according to the individualized goals. The controls are discharged according to routine with support from primary care if needed. Assessments are made by therapists who are not involved in the training upon returning home, at 1 month, 3 to 12 months. The assessments include anxiety, motor activity, gait and balance, and ADL. Interviews will be done to highlight the subject's own experience.

It is important to evaluate new methods and organizational changes prior to their implementation in health care. The investigators hope to show that very early supported discharge with rehabilitation is safe and provides confidence and less anxiety. Then it is possible to introduce a method that simultaneously improves patient outcome and increases availability of hospital beds."
NCT01624402,"Older adults who are stroke survivors can experience many challenges, including depression, cognitive dysfunction, and physical disability. Family members and other caregivers may struggle with helping stroke survivors adjust to life after stroke. This research study involves testing a modified form of problem-solving therapy called Ecosystem Focused Therapy (EFT) to help treat depression in older adult stroke survivors. EFT teaches problem-solving skills to patients to help them cope with problems related to stroke and depression, alters their physical environment to accommodate new needs resulting from stroke, and helps the family or caregiver to assist in the patient's adaptation. In addition this study will compare EFT to an education intervention to see which is more effective in treating depressed stroke survivors."

NCT04013750,"The investigators aimed To analyze effect of modified constraint induced movement therapy on upper extremity functions and quality of life of subacute and chronic phase stroke patients with right/left hemisphere damage. A total of 40 patients (20 patients with right hemiplegia and 20 patients with left hemiplegia) were enrolled in our prospective, randomized and controlled trial. Patients were randomized in to three groups. The first group consists of 10 right hemiplegia patients and the second group consists of 10 left hemiplegia patients.

NCT05241457,"The Ekso (Ekso Bionics) is a wearable exoskeleton that provides robotic support and walking assistance for patients with lower extremity paralysis. Research suggests that exoskeleton-assisted gait training is as effective as conventional gait training at improving walking outcomes and balance during both the chronic and subacute period following stroke (Goffredo et al., 2019; Molteni et al., 2017; Molteni et al., 2021; Nam et al., 2019; Rojek, 2019).

Exoskeleton-assisted gait training during acute inpatient rehabilitation provides a means for patients to actively participate in gait training during the early and most severe stages of stroke recovery. Most acute inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) report a feasibility of 5-8 Ekso sessions during inpatient stays and demonstrate significant improvement from baseline (Nolan et al., 2020; Swank, 2020). Nolan et al. (2020) demonstrated that stroke patients receiving Ekso ambulated 1640 feet more than patients undergoing more conventional gait training techniques during inpatient rehabilitation, suggesting that the exoskeleton may offer additional benefit during this phase of recovery. Despite promising evidence, there have been no randomized controlled trials within the IRF setting.

Because Ekso-gait training increases the number of steps patients can take, during acute inpatient physical therapy (PT), the investigators hypothesize that patients who participate in Ekso-gait training will demonstrate quicker improvements in balance, gait speed, endurance and independence in functional ambulation during their stay in the IRF.

In this study, eligible patients admitted to Sunnyview Rehabilitation Hospital (SRH) for rehabilitation following stroke will be randomized to receive conventional or Ekso-gait training therapy. Meaningful clinical benchmarks for balance and walking will be assessed using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) (Alghadir, 2018; Moore, 2018), the 10 Meter Walk Test (10MWT) (Bowden, 2008; Moore, 2018), the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) (Kubo et al., 2020; Moore, 2018), and Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) (Mehrholz, 2007). Achieving these benchmark scores are associated with several positive outcomes, including increased ability to ambulate in the community and reduced risk of falling (Alghadir, 2018; Bowden, 2008; Kubo et al., 2020). The investigators also hypothesize that patients in the Ekso cohort will report greater value/usefulness when compared to patients receiving standard care."
NCT03605381,"Information regarding the likely progress of post-stroke symptoms is vitally important to stroke survivors to allow them to plan for the future and to adjust to life after stroke. Moreover, the prevalence of morbidity secondary to stroke is of central importance to Health Professionals to understand the prognosis of the disease in the patients under their care. Additionally, it will also allow commissioners of care, planners and third sector organisations to adapt to and answer the needs of a post-stroke population.

Currently, the data collected by national audit programmes are concentrated on what can be termed 'process or process of care' data. The utility of these data are in the ability to audit the care received by stroke survivors on stroke units against evidenced standards for care, thus ensuring evidence based practice. Nevertheless, process of care is only one form of measuring stroke unit care and the audit programmes collect some limited functional status data, data relating to risk-factor co-morbidities and treatment received data. Therefore, the scope of this study is to build on the minimum data set currently collected and to collect post-stroke data in domains not currently collected.

The International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) takes important steps to collect data outside of process of care data such as a Patient Reported outcome data in their minimum outcome data set for stroke [currently under review].. Nevertheless, the ICHOM doesn't currently advocate the specific collection of data relating to cognitive impairment or emotional problems secondary to stroke. It is in these important aspects that this study will augment the data set currently advocated by ICHOM to collect data in the areas of cognitive impairment and emotional problems secondary to stroke.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to quantify the prevalence of morbidity at six months post-stroke."

NCT05158543,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is defined as ""rapidly developing clinical signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function, with symptoms lasting 24 hours or longer or leading to death, with no apparent cause other than of vascular origin"". By applying this definition, transient ischemic attack (TIA), which is defined to last less than 24 hours, and patients with stroke symptoms caused by subdural hemorrhage, tumors, poisoning, or trauma, are excluded.Task-oriented training (TOT) involves active training of motor tasks performed within a clear functional context that includes complex whole task or pre-task movements of the whole limb or a limb segment. A high number of repetitions performed within a single session characterizes this training. According to the literature, TOT results in neuroplastic changes and is critical for improving motor and functional recovery. Task-specific training is based fundamentally on the concept that repeated practice results in learning a specific task. There is increasing evidence of neural plastic changes associated with repeated training, and several aspects of rehabilitation entail repetition of movement. Repeated motor practice has been demonstrated to decrease muscle weakness and spasticity and form the physiological foundation of motor learning. Repeated practice of challenging movement tasks results in larger brain representations of the practiced movement."

NCT01787123,"This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-center clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of administrating intravenous Cerebrolysin™ (EVER NEURO Pharma, Austria), a preparation of low-molecular weight neurotrophic peptides and free amino acids, in improving the functional outcome of patients suffering from aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage ( SAH).

Cerebrolysin™ is a porcine-derived intravenous formulation composed of multiple lipid-soluble active agents that can cross the blood-brain barrier. It is a registered medication in several countries indicated for stroke and Alzheimer's disease. It contains several low molecular weight neuropeptides and free amino acids that possess neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties. It has been proven to arrest or mitigate several crucial steps along the ischemic cascade in preclinical studies. Cerebrolysin™ has been extensively investigated in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, brain trauma and ischemic stroke with promising clinical results. It's use in SAH patients has never been investigated and it is believed that it may play a role in improving clinical outcomes.

Consecutive patients aged 18 to 70 years-old diagnosed to have spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to a ruptured intracranial aneurysm will be randomly allocated into one of two study arms: (1) to receive intravenous Cerebrolysin™ in additional to standard of care (intervention group) or (2) to receive usual standard of care alone (control group). Permuted-block randomization will be carried out once the eligibility criteria have been fulfilled using a computer system with an allocation list of random order. Instructions on study arm allocation will be contained in sealed envelopes labeled with sequential study numbers. Patients presenting beyond 96 hours after onset of symptoms or if recruitment and randomization cannot be performed within this time period will be excluded. The reason being that post-SAH arterial vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia usually occurs four days after aneurysm rupture and lasts for two weeks i.e. 14 days. Should this complication arise before Cerebrolysin™ is administered there would be significant confounding of trial outcome measures . The timing of intervention is in keeping with several landmark clinical studies that have dealt with neuroprotective agents in subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Patients in the intervention group will receive in a daily total dose of 30ml of intravenous Cerebrolysin™. The study medication will be administered in three separate 10ml doses (every eight hours) diluted in 0.9% NaCl saline to a total volume of 100 ml as an intravenous infusion over a time period of 15 minutes. An identical amount of 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) saline (100 ml) will be used as placebo for patients allocated to the control study group. The total duration of study medication or placebo administration will be 14 days.

Cerebrolysin™ is a clear yellow solution. Since it is susceptible to photo-degeneration the preparation after dilution with 0.9% NaCl saline requires masking with a opaque plastic wrap as well as special photo-protective infusion sets. The dilution of the Cerebrolysin™ solution will be performed by ward nursing staff . Subjects in both trial groups will receive identically wrapped preparations so that both the functional outcomes assessor and patient are blind to the study arm allocation.

In addition to general demographic data, clinical data including the admission Glasgow Coma Score, severity grading of SAH, hospital stay as well as the extended Glasgow Outcome Score and modified Rankin Score upon discharge, at three months and six months will be prospectively collected. The functional outcomes assessor will be an occupational therapist unaware of the subject's trial group allocation.

Hypothesis: compared to patients receiving standard care for the management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage alone (control), the additional administration of intravenous Cerebrolysin™ (intervention) within the acute phase of stroke is safe and improves functional outcome at six months after stroke."

NCT01849887,"Stroke is a major cause of adult disability. Currently approved reperfusion therapies are provided to only a small percentage of patients in the U.S. New therapies are needed that improve outcome and that can be accessed by a majority of patients. Animal studies suggest that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, administered intravenously days after a stroke, safely improve long-term behavioral outcome. A large human experience suggests the safety of allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. The current study aims to assess the safety of this therapy in patients with recent ischemic stroke."
NCT01882556,"Patients who survive a stroke are often left with an arm that cannot be used. One reason for this is that the muscles affected by the stroke become overactive. This is known as spasticity. Such unwanted muscle overactivity, if left untreated or poorly managed, can lead to limb deformities. For example, the wrist and fingers in the arm affected by spasticity become stiff and curl into a fist and the hand cannot be used for any functional purpose. Palm hygiene can become difficult and patients find this deformity unsightly and painful. Botulinum toxin (BT) has been shown to reduce muscle overactivity and is licensed for this purpose. In current practice this treatment is often used as a last line of defence. Although BT can reduce the muscle overactivity, when injected using current protocols, it seems to have little impact on the recovery of function and/or treating the limb deformities and pain. If BT can be given in the early stages of a stroke, i.e. as soon as the muscle overactivity is observed, then we will be able to treat spasticity and may prevent the limb deformities and pain from developing. We may also be able to assist the recovery of arm movement in some of the patients who would otherwise not have regained this. In addition to benefiting the patient, the prevention of secondary complications by early treatment may reduce the costs of long term care to the NHS . We hope to discover if our plan of providing early treatment with BT is more effective than the current approach. If we demonstrate that the treatment is effective we will be able to introduce this new method almost immediately within the NHS through our collaboration with doctors and therapists who are actively treating patients with this condition."

NCT01891565,"The amount of active therapy provided to patients on an inpatient stroke rehabilitation unit has been reported as often insufficient. Observational studies have found that in the first 14 days post stroke, patients receive very little therapy and have very low activity levels. More opportunity to practice may, however, improve short-term outcomes such as the level of mobility, endurance, use of the affected arm and leg, and length of stay. The Stroke Inpatient Rehabilitation Reinforcement of ACTivity (SIRRACT) trial will utilize sensors that reveal the type, quantity, and aspects of quality of patient activities outside of the confines of research laboratories. SIRRACT will deploy inexpensive Personal Activity Monitors (PAMs), comprised of triaxial accelerometers worn on the thighs.

The objectives of the study are:

i. To assess the impact of feedback from Personal Activity Monitors (PAM)s on amount of active practice, walking speed and distance in stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation.

ii. To assess the impact of feedback from PAMs on physical, psycho-emotional, cognitive and ecosocial Health-Related Quality of Life of stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation.

iii. To assess the acceptability of thigh-strapped accelerometer use among stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation.

iv. To assess the reliability and validity of thigh-strapped accelerometer use among stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation.

Hypotheses In moderate to severely disabled subjects who are receiving in-patient rehabilitation, daily feedback from PAMs about purposeful activity will increase the amount of active practice by >30%, a higher proportion of subjects who reach the level of independence for walking, and increase walking speed by 25%, leading to higher mean walking speeds and distances at the time of discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Daily feedback from PAMs on increase in walking speed and distances will improve physical, psychological, cognitive and ecosocial domains of Health-related quality of life."
NCT01924325,"Nondisabling cerebrovascular events represent the largest group of cerebrovascular disease with a high risk of recurrent stroke. A recent trial indicated that clopidogrel and aspirin treatment reduced the risk of recurrent stroke and was not associated with increased hemorrhage events, compared with aspirin monotherapy. Apixaban, a new oral anticoagulant, is proved to be as effective as traditional anticoagulants with less risk of bleeding events.

To estimate whether apixaban is beneficial for acute TIA or minor stroke, a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, controlled clinical trial has been designed.

Although there is a risk assessment model for hemorrhagic transformation after thrombolysis, there is no evidence of clinical application in the population of Guangdong Province. .

Purpose: To verify the clinical application effect of the existing risk assessment model for hemorrhage transformation after thrombolysis in the local population; to improve the existing prediction model and verify the predictive value of HT after intravenous thrombolysis.

Methods: (1) Continuously collect AIS patients who received intravenous thrombolysis in our hospital from January 2014 to December 2020 to verify the clinical application effects of three existing models (HAT, SIT-sICH, THRIVE) on bleeding transformation. Collect baseline and bleeding transformation information within 7 days after thrombolysis, and use ROC curve, calibration curve, sensitivity and specificity to evaluate the prediction effect. A logistic regression model was used to construct an improved HT prediction model based on the AIC principle; (2) Continuous collection of AIS patients who received intravenous thrombolysis in two local hospitals from January 2021 to December 2022 for internal and external verification.

Expected results: (1) Evaluate the clinical application value of the existing prediction model in local AIS patients with intravenous thrombolysis; (2) Develop a modified risk assessment model suitable for hemorrhage transformation after intravenous thrombolysis in AIS patients in Guangdong area, and evaluate the risk early Provide guarantee for clinical diagnosis and treatment."

NCT04578288,"Optimal blood pressure management during endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke is not well established. Several retrospective data indicate, that there is a U-shaped relationship of admission blood pressure and functional outcome, where either very high or very low blood pressure are disadvantageous for the patient. Low blood pressure might lead to hypoperfusion in ischemic areas (i.e. penumbra) and to larger infarction sizes, while on the other hand, maladaptive high blood pressure might lead to edema and hemorrhage. Retrospective data investigating intraprocedural blood pressure and its influence on outcome is limited. Some studies indicate that hypotensive blood pressure drops from the level of the admission blood pressure lead to a worse outcome. Intraprocedural hypotensive drops are common during endovascular thrombectomy due to application of necessary sedative drugs for agitated stroke patients. We aim to investigate whether individualized blood pressure management with patient-specific blood pressure targets situated at the level during presentation might be associated with better functional outcome compared with general blood pressure targets for patients during thrombectomy. For this purpose, we plan to perform this single center, parallel-group, open-label randomized controlled trial with blinded endpoint evaluation (PROBE)."

NCT02017756,"Stroke is the first and the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and China, respectively. Disruption of cerebrovascular vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque is the major etiology of ischemic stroke. Therefore, early detection and treatment of vulnerable plaques occurring at the feeding arteries to brain (cerebral arteries) will be helpful for prevention of stroke.

Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease that usually affects multiple vascular beds. Previous studies have shown that these high risk lesions in different segments of cerebral arteries (intracranial and extracranial arteries) might be racially specific. It is reported that, in stroke patients, intracranial vulnerable plaques are prevalent in Asian populations whereas atherosclerosis more frequently involves extracranial carotid arteries in American subjects. However, these findings are based on angiographic imaging approaches via measuring arterial luminal stenosis. Because the atherosclerotic plaque often appears as outward expansion, namely positive remodeling during progression, measuring luminal stenosis will underestimate the disease severity. Hence, directly viewing the plaque in the vessel wall is strongly suggested in order to objectively evaluate the cerebrovascular vulnerable plaque.

High resolution, black-blood magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has been widely used to accurately characterize carotid vulnerable plaque in the last two decades. The aim of using MR black-blood techniques is to suppress the blood signal (black) to enhance the signal contrast between the vessel wall and blood in the arterial lumen. Excellent agreement has been achieved between MR imaging and histology in identification of plaque components, such as intraplaque hemorrhage and lipid core. For assessing carotid plaque, MR imaging is superior to computed tomography and ultrasound imaging techniques due to its advantages including noninvasive imaging, lack of ionizing radiation, excellent soft tissue resolution, and multi-parametric image acquisition.

The Investigators hypothesize that there are specific characteristics in carotid vulnerable plaques in Chinese patients with ischemic cerebrovascular events such as ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). This study seeks to investigate the characteristics of vulnerable plaque in carotid arteries using high resolution, black-blood MR imaging in patients with recent TIA or ischemic stroke.

This is a cross-sectional, multicenter study. A total of 1000 patients will be recruited from more than 10 different hospitals across China within 3 years. All patients will undergo MR imaging for brain and carotid arteries within two weeks after symptom onset. The prevalence of carotid vulnerable plaque and its correlations with brain ischemic lesions, traditional risk factors, and regional distribution of China will be determined."
NCT02016547,"Intravenous (IV) Alteplase (rt-PA) is the gold standard for brain infarction within 4 h 30 of symptoms onset. Efficacy of this therapy is limited in the setting of large artery occlusions. For middle cerebral artery occlusions (MCA)or internal carotid artery occlusions (ICA), recanalization rates will drop as low as 10%. This element is critical as prognosis is linked to recanalization. Arterial re-occlusions are frequent and may reach 30%, which limits IV thrombolysis efficacy.With the endovascular approach, recanalization rates may reach 90% with last generation devices. A recent meta-analysis has shown that the best candidates for thrombectomy are MCA occlusions. In the coronary literature, endovascular therapy efficacy is increased in association with antiplatelets such as abciximab. The aim of the study was to assess the feasibility of thrombectomy associated with abciximab on revascularisation (TICI score), as well as safety (symptomatic intracranial bleeding), in order to design a clinical trial versus the gold standard for acute ischemic stroke revascularization strategies using IV rt-PA.This is a controlled, pilot study, evaluating feasibility and safety of thrombectomy with abciximab versus IV rt-PA in acute ischemic stroke patients within 4h30 of symptoms onset."

NCT02032225,"Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an archetypal small vessel disease of the brain caused by dominant mutations in the NOTCH3 receptor. Cardinal vascular lesions include deposition of granular osmiophilic material (GOM) within the basal lamina of smooth muscle cells, progressive smooth muscle cell loss, and fibrosis of the media. Pathogenic mutations alter the number of cysteine residues in the extracellular domain of NOTCH3 (Notch3 ECD), leading to its abnormal accumulation in the GOM deposits. Vascular smooth muscle cell has been identified as the primary target cell in this disease. Pathophysiological processes leading from NOTCH3 mutations to smooth muscle cell loss remain poorly understood.

The investigators propose to study these mechanisms by reprogramming skin cells to become stem cells and then differentiating them to vascular smooth muscle cells.

The hypothesis of this study is that the differentiated smooth muscle cells will display the characteristic features of CADASIL, ie, Notch3 ECD accumulation and GOM deposits."

NCT03987633,"Health inequality and genetic disparity are a significant issue in the United Kingdom (UK).

This study focuses on diseases that are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in the UK, and specifically examines the extent and basis of treatment failure in different patient populations.

The vast majority of drug registration clinical trials have under-representation of ethnic minority populations. In addition, the wider Caucasian populations have reasonably different clinical characteristics to the population that participated in the drug licencing clinical trials. A consequence of this is that drugs are licensed for use in real-world general patient populations where the clinical trial results are simply not statistically significant to specifically demonstrate efficacy or safety in populations that were either absent or under-represented in the drug registration clinical trials. When these facts are considered alongside data that supports significant under-reporting of adverse events in the real-world setting within the UK (and globally, e.g the USA and Europe), it highlights that pharmacovigilance systems are unable to capture drug effectiveness and safety data in a manner that can reasonably assure appropriate prescribing in the wider patient populations.

This large real-world research study aims to identify whether commonly prescribed drugs are effective in treating illnesses that cause significant poor health and death in the different patient populations that represent the UK.

The goal of this study is to generate large quantitative data-sets that may inform clinical practice to reduce the existing health inequality and genetic disparity in the UK."

In a randomized controlled clinical trial, 10 sub-acute stroke patients will receive four weeks of robotic therapy sessions, integrated seamlessly into their daily rehabilitation program, while 10 other patients will receive conventional therapy. The investigators will assess baseline performance in an initial clinical and robotic assessment, with another assessment at the end of the four-week period, and in follow-ups four weeks and six months later. The contents of the patient-tailored robotic therapy sessions will match those of the conventional therapy as closely as possible. This study will demonstrate the feasibility of including robotic therapy of hand function into the daily rehabilitation program, and investigate the acceptance from patients and therapists. The investigators expect increased training intensity during the robotic therapy session compared to conventional sessions with similar contents, as well as novel insights into the recovery process of both the motor and the sensory system during the four weeks of therapy, through advanced robotic assessments integrated into the training sessions. This project is a first step towards making such robotic therapy available to patients as integration into the conventional individual therapy program (e.g. for self-training), and towards transferring this technology to the home environment."

Stroke is a prevalent and debilitating illness that affects people all around the world. Stroke is the second or third largest cause of mortality in adults, as well as one of the primary causes of adult disability. Because the majority of stroke patients survive the initial illness, the long-term impacts on patients and their families have the greatest influence on health. Kinesiotaping is a revolutionary rehabilitation procedure. It's most typically used to treat sports injuries, however, it is progressively becoming effective in overcoming other abnormalities. Kinesio Tex tape brand is a flexible, thin, porous cotton fabric with an adhesive backing manufactured by Dr. Kenzo Kase. It provides cutaneous stimulation which facilitates or limit movement, aids in the reduction of edema, reduces pain and correct joint positions for easing muscle spasms."

NCT02148939,"Many patients suffer from acute and chronic pain. The incidence of chronic pain correlates with increased age. Most of patients rely on analgesic medication to control the pain. Dipyrone is an extensively used drug in Western and Eastern Europe as well as Central and South America, largely due to its favorable analgesic and antipyretic effects in conjunction with a low incidence of gastrointestinal complications when compared to other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Aspirin is the backbone of antiplatelet therapy in patients after ischemic stroke. However, it is known that there are substantial inter-individual response variabilities to antiplatelet medication. Furthermore, patients with impaired response to aspirin have a significant higher risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events. The investigators have recently shown that co-medication with aspirin and dipyrone in patients with coronary artery disease lead to insufficient antiplatelet effects of aspirin.

The incidence of chronic pain is very high in patients with ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study the investigators aim to examine, if co-medication of aspirin and dipyrone interaction also occurs in patients after ischemic stroke."

NCT02284087,"Introduction The motor impairment of the upper extremity is the most common sequelae after ischemic stroke. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a promising non- invasive technique in the rehabilitation of motor deficits. However, its effect in post-stroke motor deficits remains moderate our days. To potentiate the effect of TMS, techniques called Paired Associative Stimulations (PAS) involving the integration of afferent sensory inputs at the level of the ipsilesional primary motor cortex were developed in healthy subjects. PAS techniques have shown a gain of corticospinal excitability by such phenomenon known as long Term Potentiation (LTP) and a gain of motor performance. The investigators would like to propose to evaluate two types of these techniques with a volley of visual afferents (visuomotor stimulation, V_PAS) or of cerebellar afferents (CER_PAS), because these two structures convey important information in the execution of the movement.

Design Multicenter, randomized, study, 60 patients in 3 parallel groups (V_PAS, CER_PAS, control group with sham and sham V_PAS CER_PAS), 5 days of treatment, clinical assessment, electrophysiological and MRI before, immediately post- and second post-assessments (4 weeks).

A group of 24 healthy subjects will undergo a parallel physiopathological study on the underlying mechanisms of cerebellar PAS

Objectives Main objective: To determine whether (and how) Paired Associative Stimulation technique (PAS) induces cerebral reorganization in the primary motor cortex compared to the control group.

Aim 2: Determine whether (and which) type of PAS is capable of inducing changes in motor performance of the upper limb paresis and duration Aim 3: Determine whether (and which) type of PAS is capable of inducing changes in excitability of the corticospinal tract and duration Aim 4: Determine how PAS techniques modify the functional connectivity during movement Aim 5: Determine if connectivity changes during induced movement correlate with clinical improvements Aim 6: Determine whether patients who benefit of a type of PAS have specific anatomical lesion characteristics (volume, afferent and efferent white matter fasciculi integrity)"

NCT02184936,"Treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is aimed at salvaging viable but ischemic brain by opening the occluded artery and restoring anterograde perfusion as quickly as possible. Time saved while making critical decisions correctly is vital in AIS management. Conventional angiography is invasive, resource intensive and not feasible as a fast diagnostic tool. Perfusion CT and MRI are both susceptible to patient motion, need trained personnel to process and take at least 10-30 min to acquire and interpret. The investigators have developed a new imaging tool, multi-phase CT Angiography (CTA), which generates multiple time resolved images of backfilling arteries beyond a blocked artery filled by collaterals.

Investigators seek to determine: i) if patients with AIS will have a differential clinical response to early recanalization based on collateral status assessed on multi-phase CTA, ii) if the extent to which collateral assessment on multi-phase CTA resembles perfusion CT in predicting which patients will have good clinical outcome with early recanalization, iii) Identify determinants of variability in native collateral status in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Investigators hypothesize that patients with good and intermediate collaterals on multi-phase CTA achieve good clinical outcome with early recanalization (within 4 hours of baseline imaging); patients with poor collaterals do not do well even with early recanalization.

Prove-IT is a prospective multi-center hospital-based cohort study of 500 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke presenting within 12 hours of stroke symptom onset with evidence of intracranial occlusion on routine CTA over 3 years. Calgary and seven other comprehensive stroke centers will recruit patients into this study. Primary outcome is defined as a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 0 to 2 at 24 hours or an 8-point drop in NIHSS score from baseline to 24 hours. Secondary outcomes are a) 90-day modified Rankin Score (mRS) 0-2 or equal to the pre-stroke mRS; b) percent neurologic improvement comparing NIHSS at baseline to 24 hours; c) 90-day NIHSS score 0-2; d) infarct volume on 24 hour imaging and e) parenchymal intracerebral hemorrhage type 1 and 2 (ECASS II criteria) at 24 hrs.

NCT02189928,"Cerebral infarction is the most common form of stroke (80% of strokes). Stroke is the first cause of acquired disability, and the 2nd cause of dementia and death. The only approved treatment in the first 4.5 hour is intravenous rt-PA thrombolysis (Actilyse ®) whose objective is recanalization of occluded artery and reperfusion of the brain parenchyma. Few patients are treated (1-5%) and they keep disability in 50-60% of cases. This handicap is mainly correlated to the final infarct size. The objective of neuroprotective treatments is to reduce the final size of the cerebral infarction.

The per-conditioning remote ischemic (Per-CID) showed a neuroprotective effect in cerebral ischemia by reducing the final size of cerebral infarction animal models. The per-CID corresponds, in cases of cerebral ischemia, to iterative ischemia realization of a member with a cuff. In humans, the per-CID has shown a cardioprotective effect in a randomized control trial involving 250 patients within 6 first hours of myocardial infarction and candidate for primary angioplasty."

NCT02296268,"Stroke is a leading cause of chronic disability here in Nova Scotia and globally. Aerobic exercise is known to improve health by increasing energy levels, physical mobility, balance, bone health, cardiovascular risk reduction, mental well-being, cognition, sleep, and quality of life. Nonetheless, people remain woefully inactive after stroke, regardless if they are in hospital or at home. The current investigative team and others have shown that even during physiotherapy, exercise intensity is not adequate to increase physical fitness. Consequently, patients are often deprived of a treatment that could improve their recovery. Why does this gap between evidence and clinical practice persist? Through a national survey the current team found that an important contributing factor is lack of appropriate screening (especially stress tests) to ensure that patients are safe to engage in aerobic exercise. This project is designed to close this evidence-practice gap by establishing a state-of-the-art aerobic exercise screening and prescription clinic at the Nova Scotia Rehabilitation Centre (NSRC). The intent is to compare outcomes of stroke rehabilitation participants before and after the clinic is underway and determine if the clinic has a positive effect on the confidence of NSRC physiotherapists to use aerobic exercise safely and effectively in stroke rehabilitation."

NCT05055960,"Stroke is a common condition which results in significant disability for patients. There are different causes of stroke, but around one quarter are as a result of clots or other material from the heart lodging in blood vessels in the brain, stopping the blood supply to that area. Atrial fibrillation is a common cause of blood clots which go to the brain and can be easily treated with blood thinning medications, which significantly reduce the risk of further strokes. However, at the moment, atrial fibrillation is difficult to identify, and heart monitoring can be needed for up to one year. This significantly delays starting blood thinning medications and leaves patients at risk of stroke during this time. Therefore, better ways of picking up strokes caused by atrial fibrillation are needed. One such method may be to use brain scans which are routinely taken at the time a patient presents with an acute stroke. By using mathematical models to work out the source of stroke, we may be able to determine which strokes are caused by atrial fibrillation at the time the patient presents with their stroke. This would reduce the number of investigations patients under-go, saving money for the NHS, and reducing the number of tests patients have. Therefore, the aim of this project is to create an anonymised database of brain scans from patients who have presented to hospital with a stroke to develop and test these recently developed models to see if they can accurately identify which strokes are caused by atrial fibrillation, and which ones are not. This project has the potential to improve patient outcomes by reducing treatment delays and improving the accuracy of the diagnosis of the stroke source."
NCT05157347,"Stroke is reported as one of leading causes of adult disability. Recent advances in in revascularization therapy have had a significant impact on clinical and functional outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke. However, revascularization therapy can only be applied to a limited population of patients. Many stroke survivors are still suffering from significant motor impairments and gait disturbance. The recovery of the ambulatory function in stroke patients is one of the most important goals of their rehabilitation and a critical factor influencing the patient's home and social activities.

One of the most frequently occurring disabilities in stroke patients is the ambulatory impairment. Ambulation is a key factor in performing the activities of daily living. About 80% of stroke patients showed the ambulatory impairment in acute stroke phase, and many stroke patients were not fully regain the ambulatory function although the ambulatory function was rapidly restored within 6 months after onset. Because the ambulatory function is the most important relating factor on activities of daily living and quality of life, one of the most important goals of stroke rehabilitation can be the achievement of independent gait. The conventional gait rehabilitation has been performed as a 1:1 training session between the therapist and a stroke patient. This gait rehabilitation can make a significant burden on the therapist and restriction of the rehabilitation time. The limited number of rehabilitation facilities and therapists for the number of stroke patients requiring rehabilitation means that many stroke patients might receive not enough gait rehabilitation.

To overcome these issues, a lot of studies have been conducted to develop rehabilitation robots for effective gait training. Nonetheless, in previous studies regarding robot-assisted gait rehabilitation, the stroke patients varied in terms of their baseline gait ability, functional level, and onset of stroke. In addition, robots for gait rehabilitation robots were various such as exoskeletal, end effector and overground gait types with varied frequency, duration and intensity of the gait rehabilitation training. Such heterogeneity inevitably limited the quality of the studies as well as the application in clinical practice. For an adequate robot-assisted gait rehabilitation in clinical practice, the functional level and the phase of stroke patients should be taken into consideration. In addition, for the gait rehabilitation robots to be applied effectively, it also should be considered to have a defined indication as well as a protocol including frequency, duration and intensity of robot-assisted gait rehabilitation.

A robot could have efficiency in assisting patients to practice correct and repetitive movements with the adequate quantity and intensity of training. The robot-assisted gait rehabilitation using a treadmill-based robot for location control has increased in stroke rehabilitation. However, the conditions of treadmill gait differ from those of actual overground gait so that the increase in gait ability after treadmill-based training might not directly translate into the improvement of overground gait. In addition, a drawback of such gait training using a robot for location control could be the difficulty in adapting the robotic movements to the patient's efforts to move the muscles and to the passive characteristics of the musculoskeletal system. On the contrary, overground gait training has been reported to improve the gait speed and endurance to a greater degree than treadmill gait training in stroke patients.

Recently, overground gait training using an exoskeletal wearable robot has been proposed to promote the activation of the nervous system by inducing an active participation from the patient who performed active balance control, weight shift, and muscle activation. In the previous study, the effect of gait training using an exoskeletal robot was reported in patients with incomplete paraplegia caused by spinal cord injury. Nevertheless, lack of studies have reported on the effect of gait training using an exoskeletal wearable robot in subacute stroke patients."

NCT03588832,"A high number of patient with stroke develops spasticity of the upper extremity, this clinical sign of damage of 1 motoneuro (MN), causes postures and patterns of abnormal movement, due to the hyperexcitability of the MN and the rheological alterations that occur in the affected muscles. These alterations limit the use of upper extremity, restricting its use in functional activities and affecting the quality of life and social participation of the users. During the last few years the classification of the Hefter patterns for spasticity of the upper limb was created, with the end of having a common language and orienting the current therapeutic strategies oriented towards the arm.

Objective: To determine the prevalence of patterns and their impact on the quality of life of patients after a stroke.

Material and method: Descriptive design of cross section, the sample will be composed of 600 people who attend integral rehabilitation center of regions V, VIII, IX and X in Chile, that meet the inclusion criteria and sign the informed consent. The study will include a measurement made by a trained professional from each participating center using a registration form, the FIM scale and the Barthel index, to assess quality of life.

Results: It will be analyzed with the SPSS software through descriptive and inferential statistics considering the nature of the variables, all the analyzes will consider as statistically significant the results with p values less than or equal to 0.05. Depending on the interval or ordinal level of the measurements, the coefficients r of Pearson and rho of Spearman will be used to calculate the correlations.

Applicability: The results will determine the prevalence in this geographical sector, disseminate this classification and promote the use of a common language among professionals to enhance their daily work. In addition, it will allow to determine how the affectation of the upper extremity through the identification of a certain pattern alters the quality of life of the patient.

NCT04465019,"Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of disability in the United States. The EKSO GT Bionics® (EKSO®) is a robotic exoskeleton approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for rehabilitation following a cerebrovascular accident (CVA or stroke) and recently received approval for use in patients with TBI. The aim of the study was to examine if the use of exoskeleton rehabilitation in patients with TBI will produce beneficial outcomes. Methods: This retrospective chart-review reports the use of the (EKSO®) robotic device in the rehabilitation of patients with TBI compared to patients with CVA. The investigators utilized data from a single, private rehabilitation hospital for patients that received post-CVA or post-TBI robotic exoskeleton intervention. All patients that used the exoskeleton were discharged from the hospital between 01/01/2017 to 04/30/2020. Ninety-four percent (94%) of patients in the CVA groups and 100% of patients in the TBI group were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Gains in total Functional Independence Measure (FIM), walking and cognition, and length of stay in the rehabilitation facility were measured. Results: Patients in the TBI group (n=11) were significantly younger than the patients in the CVA group (n=66; p< 0.05). Both groups spent a similar amount of time active, number of steps taken, and the number of sessions in the exoskeleton. Both groups also started with similar admission FIM scores. The FIM gain in the TBI group was similar to that of the CVA group (37.5 and 32.0 respectively). The length of stay between groups was not different either. Conclusions: The use of exoskeleton rehabilitation in patients with TBI appear to produce similar outcomes as for patients with CVA, prompting further attention of this intervention for this type of injury."

NCT04440215,"Stroke impacts nearly 400,000 Canadians annually. Three quarters of stroke survivors will live with minor to severe impairments or disabilities; which require rehabilitation care. Strong evidence supports beginning rehabilitation as soon as the patient's medical status has stabilized and continuing following discharge from acute care. Access to optimal services is hampered, however, by travel distances to access rehabilitation, the lack of opportunities for structured and formal interprofessional communication among service providers, and failures to engage the patient and family members in a structured decision making process. Moreover, adherence to rehabilitation treatments has been shown to be suboptimal. Many patients refuse their outpatient rehabilitation treatments outright or decrease the duration and/or frequency of their treatments over time.

The aim of this proposed mixed methods pragmatic clinical trial is to evaluate an intervention that provides patients who have experienced stroke the opportunity to return home safely after their acute hospital stay, to encourage patient (and family) engagement in their rehabilitation care, and to overcome challenges of access to patient-centered interprofessional rehabilitation care.

The proposed intervention will entail 220 patients (and family) to receive rehabilitation care through remote, live treatment sessions with an interdisciplinary group of clinicians (called telerehabilitation) versus standard of care (n = 110 patients). Five rehabilitation teams will be trained to develop rehabilitation treatment plans that engage the patient and family, while taking advantage of a telerehabilitation platform to engage the patient/family. Grounded in findings gathered through a Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) funded pilot study, the primary study objective is to evaluate process, clinical outcomes and costs of telerehabilitation in comparison with usual care. Through qualitative interviews with patients and family as well as clinicians, a second objective of this pragmatic, controlled trial is to explore and describe contextual factors (both personal and environmental) that will help the delivery of care, and improve patient's outcomes while fully using technology to deliver stroke rehabilitation care.

This study represents a unique, highly relevant opportunity to minimize both knowledge and practice gaps, while producing robust, indepth data on the factors related to the effectiveness of telerehabilitation."
NCT04443127,"Stroke is the second leading global cause of mortality counting for 6.5 million deaths per annum. The global prevalence of stroke is increasing with an estimated prevalence of 33 million per year, affecting 1 out of 6 individuals during their lifetime. The international data suggests the overall economic burden in Asia is projected to be increased to 1.3 Billion by 2050. Therefore, the appropriate and timely stroke intervention is required to save healthcare costs and reduce the burden of the disease. Studies have reported the effectiveness of VR intervention not only in cognitive abilities but it has found to be simultaneously effective in improving other domains as attention and coordination with motor retraining. VR combined with a newly developed concept of motor priming has shown encouraging results in improving motor control and task execution in stroke patients. Further studies are needed to analyze the impact of motor priming with VR in stroke patients on varied neurological domains; hence the present study aims to investigate the impact of VR based motor priming on sensorimotor, functional and cognitive outcomes among sub-acute stroke patients rehabilitation."

NCT04378946,"Deficits in upper limb (UL) functional recovery persist in a large proportion of stroke survivors. Understanding how to obtain the best possible UL recovery is a major scientific, clinical and patient priority. We propose that UL motor recovery may be improved by training that focuses on remediating an individual's specific motor impairment. Our approach is based on evidence that deficits in the control of muscle activation thresholds (spatial thresholds) of the elbow in stroke underlie impairments such as disordered movement and spasticity. Our novel training program focuses on improving the individual's active elbow control range using error augmentation (EA) feedback. Since training intensity and lesion load are key factors in motor recovery that lack guidelines, we will also investigate effects of exercise dose and corticospinal tract (CST) injury on UL recovery.

In this multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial (RCT), patients with stroke will participate in an individualized intensive technology-assisted reaching training program, based on error augmentation (EA), in order to improve voluntary elbow function. They will practice robot-assisted reaching in a virtual reality (VR) game setting. We will identify if intensive training with feedback aimed at expanding the range of spatial threshold (ST) control at the elbow (experimental group) is better than intensive training with general feedback about task success (control group). We will also determine the patient-specific optimal therapy dose by comparing kinematic and clinical outcomes after 3, 6 and 9 weeks of intensive training, and again at 4 weeks after training to determine carry-over effects. We will quantify the severity of the participant's motor deficit, as the amount of cortico spinal tract (CST) injury due to the stroke (%CST injury) and relate training gains to their %CST injury. Results of this pragmatic trial will provide essential information for optimizing individualized post-stroke training programs and help determine optimal patient-specific training dosing to improve motor recovery in people with different levels of stroke severity.

This type of research involving personalized, impairment-based feedback and dose-effective training has the potential to significantly improve rehabilitation for a greater number of post-stroke individuals and improve the health and quality of life of Canadians."

NCT01417117,"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) occurs when small arteries in the brain rupture due to weakening by age, high blood pressure, and/or elevated cholesterol. In addition to artery rupture, recent data suggests that patients with ICH are also at risk for developing occlusion of arteries during the acute phase, called ischemic strokes. Data suggests these ischemic strokes can negatively impact patient outcomes. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is a sequence on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that is a sensitive marker for ischemic strokes in the brain. In this proposal, our primary aim is examine prospectively the effect DWI abnormalities have on functional outcomes in patients with ICH.

NCT04335422,"Stroke is a main cause of disability worldwide. It is characterized by motor and cognitive impairments leading to activity limitations and participation restrictions. Despite improvement in mortality and morbidity following stroke, stroke survivors need access to effective rehabilitation services. Management approach for stroke survivors is classical physical and rehabilitation medicine (PRM) interventions. Nowadays, with the advancement of technology, robotic rehabilitation systems have taken its place among the classical physical and rehabilitation medicine applications. Robotic systems for upper and lower extremity help to improve neuroplasticity by repetitive task-specific activities. Upper extremity robotic systems can be either exoskeleton or end-effector according to their mechanical designs. Exoskeleton robotic systems attach to both proximal and distal segments of the upper extremity (shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, fingers) and provide antigravity weight support allowing actuated axes of movements of the upper extremity joints. The system allows the reinforcement and facilitation of movements by means of visual feedback with a 3-dimensional virtual environment in which the patient is asked to perform various tasks by playing computer games. It is reported that robotic therapy can be used complementary to other rehabilitation methods. The neurophysiological effects of robotic therapy were shown to act in the brain, particularly on the primary motor cortex, putamen and capsula interna. The effect on motor recovery was associated with common, synchronous activity involving the corticospinal system. It has been reported by a recent Cochrane review that robot-assisted arm training improves arm function, arm muscle strength and activities of daily living in stroke survivors. A few studies have also reported positive effects on cognitive abilities. However, there are no controlled studies in the literature investigating the effects of robot-assisted upper limb training on cognitive functions following stroke. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of robot-assisted upper extremity training, applied in addition to the classical PRM program, on cognitive and physical functions after stroke. Primary aim is to investigate the effects on cognitive functions whereas secondary aim is to investigate the effects on upper extremity motor functions and activities of daily living. The investigators hypothesized that adjunctive robotic upper extremity training in addition to classical PRM program would result in better cognitive and physical outcomes compared with the classical PRM program only."

NCT04289766,"Stroke is the second leading cause of death, accounting for 11.13 % of total deaths, and the main cause of disability worldwide. The major type of stroke is ischemic, which occurs in about 87% of all stroke cases Stroke has different risk factors, which can be grouped into modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. Major risk factors for stroke include age, history of cerebrovascular event, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, metabolic syndrome, diet, nutrition, and genetic risk factors. Many new technique used for rehabilitation after stroke includes Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy for Arm or Leg Paralysis, Mirror Therapy for Hand Recovery, Harness the Relentless Force etc. Segmental muscle vibration (SMV) is also a new technique and effective to decrease the hyper-toned muscles spasticity but still less work done on it.

NCT02188628,"Locally, stroke remains the 4th cause of death, causing 8.4% of deaths annually in Singapore, and a leading cause of neurological disability worldwide. Nearly 40% of the stroke survivors will require specialized rehabilitation. In recent years, robot-aided therapy has been proposed as a means of complementing traditional therapy to alleviate the burden on therapists and on the healthcare system. For shoulder/elbow rehabilitation, dozens of robots have been proposed in the literature but only half a dozen have been commercialized and typically none are seen in local clinics, due to exceedingly high costs. A novel, compact, inexpensive robotic interface, named 'H-Man', was recently designed and developed at NTU for experiments in motor control neuroscience. The H-man can generate computer-controlled force fields to assist or resist a subject's motion and is potentially an optimal trade-off between clinical efficacy and robotic complexity. A first prototype of the H-Man is available at NTU.The primary aim of this proposed project is to assess to what extent the investigators H-Man is suitable for rehabilitation purposes using a feasibility pilot clinical trial design involving stroke survivors. The investigators believe that H-Man can be used for neuro-rehabilitation of stroke patients with hemiparetic weakness, motor incoordination and motor ataxia of the upper limbs.In close cooperation between clinicians at the TTSH and NTU engineers, a portable version of the H-Man will be developed which will be tested in a 12 subject Pilot study, refined and then used in a 44 subject Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) study. At the same time, the feasibility of H-Man integration for a pared down home use model will be assessed in 4 subjects.

The investigators primary hypothesis is that sub-acute/chronic patients will exhibit clinically significant decreases of impairment when training with the H-Man combined with standard arm therapy on robot-measured scales and standardized clinical scales, at the level of elbow/shoulder after 18 sessions of training on the H-Man."

NCT04264195,"Each year more than 17 million people in the world are experiencing a stroke. Stroke is a major cause of mortality and one of the prevalent causes of serious disablement.

Stroke sufferers often will have restricted participation in various domains e.g. not being able to fulfill the job requirements. That is why they are losing social contacts and are at risk for social deprivation.

They also show limitations in common daily activities, which implies that they often need help or must use assistive devices because of muscle weakness, spasticity and impaired control over one of the hands, which are very common after stroke. Functional hand recovery will be only minimal at 6 months after stroke in most of the patients. Therefore, patients mainly rely on their unaffected hand to perform daily activities and refrain from using the impaired hand. However, it is known that also after a stroke new connection could be made in the brain when training tasks strenuously. This mechanism is applied in our program by constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT). In CIMT using the unaffected hand is hindered by a mitten, so that patients are forced to perform tasks predominantly with the paretic hand.

The original CIMT protocol includes three main elements:

Constraining of the non-paretic hand to force the use of paretic hand.
Repetitive task-oriented training of the paretic hand.
Adherence-enhancing behavioral methods, to promote the use of this technique in the daily environment.

Although CIMT trials are showing variations in the kind of tasks, the duration of practice per day and the intensity, they all published significant effects of CIMT compared to traditional therapy.

Currently CIMT is worldwide considered the most effective rehabilitation treatment for improving the functioning of the paretic hand in stroke, but this treatment is not applied in Bangladesh. To overcome this,the investigators have made a protocol for CIMT application with the purpose to study the effects in stroke patients in the Bangladesh situation.

Method

Beside the CIMT program the investigators also developed a method for getting maximal social interaction in groups of stroke patients. That may help them to exercise on their own with support of their peers. The investigators call that a 'peer group regulated training' and stroke patients got that training in addition to the usual individually focused rehabilitation. This extra training includes the following elements:

Stroke patients perform repetitive tasks in a group together (groups 6-8 persons, max 15).
One of them is assigned as a 'leader', who announces the next task while the therapist is there mainly for helping and correcting patients.
Tasks are fine-tuned to the Bangladesh' situation regarding gender-specific clothing, manipulation of objects and tasks that needs cognitive solutions.
Within the training there are socializing tasks like singing, sharing of experiences, complimenting and encouraging each other.
Patients were asked to perform the tasks by themselves at home as well, and to report about that.

This method was applied in two separate groups. The group that is indicated as the control group mainly performed the exercise tasks bilaterally, as in as usual therapy sessions. The experimental group performed the tasks with forced use of the paretic hand, wearing a mitten at the non-paretic hand.

The investigators will be compared the performances of the two study groups at the start of the group therapy, at the finish one month later, and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months afterwards.

The hypothesis is that the applied adherence-enhancing behavioral method will have dominant effects, and that the methods: 'bilaterally' versus 'forced use of paretic arm/hand' (CIMT) will show equal improvements in the short and longer term."

NCT04617366,"Stroke patients do not respond well to the traditional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) strategy based on the competitive model. The studies found that the contralesional motion cortex has a compensatory effect on the realization of the motor function of the affected side-the compensatory model, and the degree of compensation will change as the function changes. The optimal neural regulation strategies under different models are opposite, so it is important to accurately evaluate which of the two models plays the leading role. And functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) may accurately and quickly assess cortical function in order to determine the degree of participation of the contralesional motion cortex. We propose that the dynamic individualized strategy which adjust the rTMS parameters promptly based on the results of fNIRS will be better than the traditional stimulation strategy. This project will apply a blinded-assessment randomized controlled trial. The test group selects either the high-frequency rTMS to the contralesional dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) or the low-frequency rTMS to the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1) based on the lateralization index of the PMd measured by fNIRS. And the control group will always be given low-frequency rTMS to contralesional M1. The difference in the improvement of upper limb function between the two groups of patients was compared."

The change of the signal on SWI bases on the change of local oxygenated hemoglobin content in the blood and deaeration hemoglobin content ratio, which can be used to indirectly reflect the hypoxia group oxygen intake fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic rate. When the intracranial vascular occlusion, corresponding responsibility vascular blood flow area of brain tissue will occur hypoperfusion, brain tissue will improve the compensation in accordance with its own OEF, causing ischemia area inside the venous drainage of deaeration hemoglobin content ratio increases and the hypointensity on SWI ,which display the asymmetric cortical vessel sign (ACVS). Studies have suggested that ACVS is more prone to early neurological deterioration and has a poor long-term outcome. After recanalization of ischemic stroke, the presence of equal CVS(return to normal) on SWI is associated with a good clinical outcome. In addition, the relationship between ACVS grade and collateral circulation in patients with acute ischemic stroke has been studied. For patients with massive cerebral infarction, the relationship between ACVS on SWI and the clinical prognosis of cerebral edema and cerebral hemodynamics is not completely clear. In this study, the clinical data of patients with massive cerebral infarction will be analyzed to explore the relationship between ACVS, cerebral edema , cerebral hemodynamic and clinical prognosis.

NCT04233515,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and the number of patients with AF is expected to increase substantially in the coming decades. AF affects approximately 3% of adults aged 20 years or older in Western countries with the prevalence increasing further with age and risk factor such as hypertension, structural heart disease, obesity, diabetes and chronic kidney disease.

The presence of AF is independently associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and morbidity, largely due to stroke and heart failure, dementia and impaired health-related quality of life. The management of AF aims to reduce symptoms, improve quality of life and prevent AF-related complications. About one third of AF patients do not have any perceived AF-associated symptoms, silent AF, but up to one fourth of patients report severe symptoms. Patients with silent AF are still at risk for complications.

Systemic embolization, particularly stroke, is the most frequent major complication of AF. Untreated AF, confers to a four- to fivefold increased risk of stroke compared to the general population. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy can prevent the majority of ischaemic strokes in AF patients. The stroke risk in AF patients is commonly estimated using the CHA2DS2-VASc score and OAC therapy is recommended for men with a score of 2 or more, and for women with a score of 3 or more, and should be considered for men with a score of 1 and women with a score of 2. Interventional left atrial appendage occlusion may be considered in patients with a high risk of stroke, but with contraindications for long-term OAC therapy. Although OAC therapy is superior to no treatment or aspirin, underuse or premature termination of OAC therapy, especially in older people, is probably common. The stroke risk without OAC often exceeds the bleeding risk on OAC, even in the elderly, in patient with dementia and in patients with frequent falls. The bleeding risk on aspirin is increased without preventing stroke and should be avoided according to current guidelines.

This study aims to determine the prevalence of patients with AF in Örebro County, to describe the prescribing of oral anticoagulants (OACs) in relation to stroke risk and to initiate OAC therapy or left atrial appendage occlusion in patients with a high risk for stroke, and to evaluate symptoms of AF in a general AF population.

A retrospective cohort study design will be used. Patients aged 20 years or older with a diagnosis of AF from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2018 will be identified from the National Patient Register, that covers all in-patient and outpatient physician visits from both private and public caregivers, and the Medrave 4 that is used in all public general practices. Both patients with first diagnosed AF and previously known AF will be included. OAC therapy will be defined as an active prescription issued for an OAC on 31 December 2019. Patients' records will be review for type of AF (paroxysmal, persistent or permanent AF), age, sex, comorbidities, medications, pacemaker or implantable defibrillator and prior catheter ablation. Prior OAC therapy and reason for discontinuing/ initiating treatment will be documented. Patients with a high risk of stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc of 2 or more in men and of 3 or more in women, or one point or more for age in both men and women), will be offered a clinical visit to an experienced physician at the Department of cardiology to assess stroke and bleeding risk and to possibly initiate OAC therapy or refer the patient for left atrial appendage occlusion. The study period will run from 2 September 2019 to 29 May 2020.

NCT03787693,"The major problem in stroke survivors that is being addressed in this research project is walking asymmetry, i.e., difference between the legs during walking (e.g. steps on the more affected side are longer than the other). A potential solution to this problem is using new technology like virtual reality during walking training to make stroke survivors have a better sense of their asymmetry. A second problem that we aim to address in this study is whether asymmetry is accurately felt by the stroke survivors and how we can address it. Our ongoing work on the effects of virtual reality on learning new walking tasks in stroke survivors indicates that virtual reality maybe particularly important for those with walking asymmetry. In this study, we plan to recruit stroke survivors who have such asymmetries during walking and have them learn a new walking task in virtual reality. We will also test the stroke survivors to determine if there is a relationship between how well they learn the new task with their ability to feel asymmetry accurately."

NCT04180826,"Ischemic strokes account for more than 80% of strokes. Ischemic strokes are caused by the occlusion of an intracranial artery by a thrombus, responsible for tissue ischemia related to a decrease in local cerebral blood flow (CBS). Thus, the management of patients with Ischemic strokes is based on the preservation of an area that maintains sufficient intracranial hemodynamics (IH) and achieves the fastest possible recanalization. The impact of the patient's position (supine or seated position) on the IH in the event of narrowing or occlusion of an artery is poorly assessed but may be of particular importance. In practice, variations in blood flow according to the positioning of the patient's body can be measured using a transcranial Doppler. It is a simple, non-invasive and painless examination that provides the patient's bed with data on the intracerebral hemodynamic profile of patients.

This study was implemented because there are no studies known to us that evaluate the effect of verticalization on intracerebral hemodynamics based on the presence of upstream arterial stenosis or occlusion and other multimodal evaluation data in transcranial Doppler."
NCT04161820,"Stroke is the third leading cause of death worldwide and is defined as neurological deficit due to ischemic or hemorrhagic causes. The risk of death in the 30 days following recurrent stroke was reported to be between 23% and 41%, and the risk of new disability was between 39% and 53%. Therefore, patient self-management is important in preventing recurrent stroke. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of education and telephone follow-up based on the Chronic Care Model on self-management, quality of life and patient satisfaction in patients with ischemic stroke. The study is a randomized controlled experimental study. A total of 68 patients (34 interventions and 34 controls) were randomized into a computer program with 80% power, 95% reliability and 0.05 margin of error. Patients were included in the study according to the inclusion criteria and randomization list. The self-management support component of the Chronic Care Model was implemented using the 5A (ASK, ADVICE, ASSESS, ASSIST, ARRANGE) methodology. The Conceptual-Theoretical-Experimental structure of the research was created. A training booklet for stroke patients was created within the scope of the Chronic Care Model self-management support component. After the pre-tests, the patients who were included in the intervention group were given discharge training with a booklet prepared based on the Chronic Care Model and containing information and recommendations on self-management strategies during their stay in the hospital (0 months). These patients were followed up by telephone on the 7th day, 15th day, 1st month and 2nd month after discharge. No intervention other than routine hospital follow-up was performed for the patients included in the control group.
The patients who were included in the control and intervention groups were performed to post-tests at the 3rd month outpatient clinic control and metabolic variables of the patients were obtained from the patient clinical information system."

Decision aids (DAs) are shared decision-making tools which have been successfully implemented and validated for many other diseases to assist difficult decision making. The investigators have developed a pilot DA for goals-of-care decisions for surrogates of severe, critically ill stroke patients. This was developed through qualitative research using semi-structured interviews in surrogate decision makers of traumatic brain injury patients and physicians, and adapted to severe strokes. The investigators now propose to pilot-test a DA for surrogates of critically ill severe stroke patients in a feasibility trial."

NCT04138407,"A randomized controlled trial using seated Tai Chi (TC) as a rehabilitation intervention will be conducted among subacute stroke survivors. It aims to evaluate the effects of seated TC on recovery outcomes among subacute stroke survivors.

Stroke survivors and their unpaid caregivers will be recruited as dyads participants. A number of 160 dyads will be recruited from a neurology department of a Tertiary A level provincial Traditional Chinese Medicine hospital in Mainland China with around 1700 beds.

The study will be conducted in hospital and homes. The participants will be randomly assigned to the seated TC group or the usual exercise group. The study will last for 12 weeks (two-week training in hospital and 10-week self-practice at home) and 4-week followup.

Stroke survivors in the seated TC group will participate a TC master-led, 30-minute seated TC exercise per day, five days per week for two weeks. When they discharge, they will perform the seated TC at home for 10 weeks. Those in the usual exercise group will receive usual exercise which has the same frequency and duration as the seated TC group. They will also perform self-practices at home for 10 weeks. Family caregivers will be encouraged to support the exercise intervention and help with recording the logbook of self-practice at home. Manual and training videos recorded by the same master will be given to the dyads of both groups to facilitate their continuation of self-practice on the day they discharge through WeChat. Biweekly reminder will be sent to the family caregivers by the PI through WeChat during the self-practice and follow-up period. The stroke survivors' upper limb function, balance control, depressive symptoms, activity of daily living, and quality of life will be measured at the following time point: baseline, after the supervised intervention (two weeks), eight weeks, after self-practice intervention (12 weeks) and at the end of follow-up (16 weeks). If the study finds significant effects on recovery among subacute stroke survivors, nursing professionals can act as care coordinators/ advocators to incorporate this culture-based exercise in stroke survivors' rehabilitation programs. Seated TC can be used as a clinically feasible exercise for nurses to work with other healthcare professionals for the promotion and application of evidence-based complementary and alternative therapy in promoting stroke survivors' recovery."

NCT04112173,"Chronic stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in the United States. Post-stroke health is negatively impacted by two interrelated factors-a substantial risk of falls and limited walking activity. The risk of falling is a barrier to walking activity, with falls self-efficacy mediating the relationship between impaired physical capacity and limited activity. The ability to recover from a fall (i.e. arrest a fall before impact) is a logical, yet untested rehabilitation target to enable walking activity through sustained benefits to falls self-efficacy. Our aim is to demonstrate that fall-recovery training is feasible in stroke survivors with low falls self-efficacy. Five participants will undergo an adapted version of fall-recovery training. We will gather evidence of the implementation, adaptation, and limited efficacy of this intervention in affecting falls self-efficacy and walking activity."

NCT00508521,"Many stroke survivors exhibit persistent upper limb motor deficits and a non-functional upper limb. There is some promising information that suggests motor learning (ML) in conjunction with functional electrical stimulation (FES; surface FES; nothing implanted; use of a commercially available system) of wrist/finger muscles can significantly enhance the functional level of the upper limb. There have been promising studies showing that some subjects in the chronic phase (greater than 6 months after stroke) responded favorably to combination FES and ML (FES ML). In our pilot studies, FES ML for those in the chronic phase (>12 months) produced statistically significant functional recovery. FES was applied using a commercially available, two-channel FES system, with electrodes applied to the surface of the skin (non-invasive). But if upper limb dysfunction is not immediately treated, that is within the sub-acute phase (less than 6 months) following stroke, the following problems can develop: contractures and other soft tissue changes; chronic pain; and ingrained, abnormal, non-functional movement patterns. The more long-standing these symptoms are, the more resistant to treatment they become. Therefore, it is important to provide promising interventions prior to the onset of chronic symptoms and dysfunction. Those in the sub-acute phase after stroke should be provided with FES ML, in order to more completely restore function for a greater number of stroke survivors.

Specific Aims and Hypotheses The goal of this pilot study is to test the feasibility of the proposed treatment in the sub acute phase following stroke.

HYPOTHESIS. FES ML for 3hrs/day, five days/week, for 12 weeks will be feasible to implement in the sub-acute phase following stroke (2 -24 weeks).

Study Design

a. Specific Procedures This is a pilot study to test the feasibility of using FES ML for upper extremity rehabilitation in a sub-acute stroke population. It is a randomized, controlled, single-blind design. Subjects will be 2 - 24 weeks after a single stroke. The control group will receive standard care for upper limb rehabilitation consisting of passive and active exercise, stretching, bracing, and use of adaptive devices. The experimental group will receive the experimental intervention in addition to their standard care.

CONTROL GROUP INTERVENTION. The control group will receive the standard medical care prescribed by the primary physician and covered by the subject's health care policy. Standard care will include: soft tissue mobilization; assisted motion exercise; active motion exercise; resistive exercise; task practice; use of assistive devices; and modality applications conventionally prescribed.

FES ML INTERVENTION. The research treatment duration will be 3hrs/day, five days per week. The subjects will be present for a fourth hour each day, which will be used for breaks and rest periods that will be interspersed throughout the intervention time. The treatment duration is derived from prior work. We will stimulate muscles in a number of configurations including: wrist extension and finger extension; wrist extension and finger flexion; and wrist extension, finger flexion, and thumb abduction and opposition. Motor learning will include the performance of functional task components and full task practice during the use of FES. FES will be triggered by the patient, the treating therapist, or it will be automatically sequenced by the device according to alternate channel activations, with timings pre-set by the treating therapist.

MEASURES. Data will be collected at weeks 1, 6, 12 (end of treatment), and 6 months after the end of treatment.

Population The subjects will be sub-acute stroke survivors (2-24 weeks after stroke)."

NCT04069481,"Stroke can drastically impact the ability to walk and keep your balance. In addition people with chronic stroke feel social isolated, become less satisfied with their walking and lose confidence in their ability to move without falling.

Ned new treatments are needed for walking and balance. Dancing is a fun, social activity that has similar benefits to traditional exercise. Another benefit of dancing is the use of music, which improves mood, increases motivation and can even improve motor performance. Finally, moving in synchrony with other people during dancing can make people feel connected. We believe that dance classes can benefit people with stroke, but few studies have been done.

The objective of our project is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test whether dance can improve balance and walking for people with chronic stroke. The investigators are also interested in whether dancing improves people's confidence in their ability to do activities without losing their balance (i.e. balance confidence), decreases their feelings of isolation and increases their quality of life."

The use of Ahmed valve in the management of pediatric glaucoma associated with Sturge weber syndrome has better results as recorded by Nassiri et al. Ahmed valve implantation can have some drawbacks such as pupillary irregularity, lens opacification, or encapsulation.(4-7) Glaucoma drainage devices such as Ahmed valve, Molteno or Braeveldt valve can be used when other methods of treatment fail, they provide alternative pathway to the aqueous to be collected in a plate positioned under the conjunctiva, (8-10) Encapsulation is a major problem occurs around the end plate due to fibrous reaction and so the drainage of the aqueous is decreased , Epatein (11) attributed that to fibro vascular proliferation in the episcleral tissue .the fibrous reaction is multifactorial , it may be due to the size of the end plate, the biomaterial, design or the shape of the plate.

NCT05204225,"Stroke is the third leading cause of disability worldwide, with the hand being one of the segments whose affectation generates the greatest limitation in functional ability and quality of life. Neurorehabilitation is the most effective therapy as long as it is implemented both in the early (post-hospital stages) and in an intensive approach. However, the resources of healthcare systems are not enough to address the neurorehabilitation needs of patients with hand affectation after stroke. Thus, current scientific literature advocates transferring such rehabilitation to the patient's home through therapeutic exercise programs - whose clinical and economic effectiveness has already been demonstrated - as a way of reducing the consumption of resources. In order to achieve this, telerehabilitation is suggested as one of the most viable formats. However, current telerehabilitation systems such as video games and virtual reality do not provide a fully viable solution, mainly due to the lack of scalability and penetration of the technology, and the lack of a hand specific approach, whose importance is crucial in the recovery of function and autonomy in Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Different articles and reviews confirm the potential of tablet devices to solve these issues given their scalability and the multisensory feedback provided, making possible a more productive and intensive motor training and sensory stimulation in order to optimize cortical reorganization and neuroplasticity after a stroke. Both health professionals and patients have expressed the need for a specific Tablet application for neurorehabilitation of the hand after stroke, that follows the precepts established by the evidence. However, the lack of specific applications for this approach means that existing apps are used as an adaptation. Therefore, we propose the development and preliminary validation of ReHand, the first Tablet application developed according to the needs of healthcare professionals and patients, and the precepts of the most updated scientific literature, which allows the patient to perform an active therapy adapted to its hand limitations, and the healthcare professional to monitor their patient's home performance."
NCT02069691,"Background: Hemiplegia is one of the main reasons why stroke survivors lose their walking and balancing ability. Many studies point out that cycling is an effective means for lower limb rehabilitation. However, during training, the unaffected limb may compensate for the affected one resulting in suboptimal rehabilitation. To address this issue, the investigators developed the virtual reality-cycling training system (VRCTS) which can acquire force and speed signals in real-time through a cycling module. The system then analyzes the acquired data and uses a 3D VR rehabilitation program to help patients to train their affected side. The aim of the study was to develop the VRCTS, verify its function and test system function on both normal subjects and stroke patients.

Methods: In this system, the investigators designed a cycling device that is embedded with load cell and encoder sensors to detect cycling force and angle in real-time. A Cycling Graph User Interface Control and Data Recode System (Cycling CR System) was applied for signal analysis and feedback control. The investigators designed a 3D interactive VR rehabilitation program that can guide and train the users through visual feedback. Each user performed a pre-test to examine determine condition, left-right balance and other parameters, which allows the system to be customized."

NCT02270398,"Background Functional community ambulation not only requires a critical level of postural control and walking skills, but also the ability to engage in cognitive tasks while walking (i.e., dual-task walking) and adapt to the constantly-changing environmental contexts. There is evidence showed that dual-task balance and gait performance is significantly impaired after stroke. Increasing evidence also suggests that dual-task balance and gait performance is useful for predicting falls among individuals with stroke. Considering the high clinical relevance of dual-task balance and gait performance, it is essential that stroke rehabilitation adequately addresses dual-task deficits. Developing specific dual-task balance and gait training to enhance dual-task performance is thus necessary to promote community ambulation and reintegration.

Study Aim The aim of this Introduction Many individuals after stroke continue to cope with residual physical impairments after discharge from hospital. One of the major problems encountered by people after stroke is community reintegration. Functional community ambulation not only requires a critical level of postural control and walking skills, but also the ability to engage in cognitive tasks while walking (i.e., dual-task walking) and adapt to the constantly-changing environmental contexts. There has been an increasing awareness of the importance of dual-task gait performance in community-dwelling individuals with stroke in the past few years.

There is evidence showed that dual-task balance and gait performance is significantly impaired after stroke. Increasing evidence also suggests that dual-task balance and gait performance is useful for predicting falls among individuals with stroke.

NCT02208219,"Motor deficits are common after stroke, being one of the major causes of disability in this population. Because of the impact that motor impairments have in the life of patients and the associated financial costs, it is a health care priority to develop effective and efficient treatments to restore motor deficits. Music-supported therapy (MST) has been recently developed to enhance the use of the affected extremity after stroke.

In the present project, a new multidisciplinary approach (neurology, neuropsychology, music and cognitive neurosciences) will be undertaken in order to investigate the effectiveness of MST as a neurorehabilitation technique to restore the motor function in stroke patients. In addition, the complex pattern of reorganization of the sensorimotor system will be studied in order to provide information about the physiological mechanisms underlying the neurorehabilitation process.

A randomized controlled trial is proposed to compare for first time the effectiveness of MST (at the hospital and at home) compared to conventional treatment in subacute stroke patients suffering from motor deficits. Our hypothesis is that patients will experience a large improvement in the functional use of the affected arm due to the implementation of the MST program when compared to conventional treatment. We also expect to observe improvements in cognitive functions, mood and quality of life. Besides, we hypothesize that these amelioration in motor and cognitive domains will be accompanied by neuroplastic changes in the sensorimotor cortex and corticospinal tract."

NCT02295826,"Rationale: To date, anticoagulant therapy in acute stroke has also been limited by excess hemorrhagic events. The oral anticoagulant dabigatran is a novel agent, which has been shown to be associated with much lower intracranial hemorrhage rates. It has been suggested that this agent may provide the superior benefits of anticoagulation in acute stroke, without the concomitant increase in hemorrhage risk associated with heparin/LMWH or warfarin.

Study Design: DATAS II is a randomized, open label blinded endpoint trial. Participants (n=300) with TIA or ischemic stroke (NIHSS score <9) will be enrolled within 48 hours of symptom onset from approximately four (4) health care centres across Canada. All participants will have an MRI with DWI lesion volume < 25 ml. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to treatment with dabigatran for 30 days or ASA 81 mg daily (current standard of care). All stroke patients will initially be screened with a non-contrast CT scan of the brain. The first MRI will be performed within 48 hours of symptom onset. Imaging studies will be repeated at day 30. All patients will be assessed clinically at Day 30 and Day 90.

Study Aims:

Establish the safety of early anticoagulation with the novel oral anticoagulant dabigatran in acute cerebrovascular syndrome patients.
Identify the rate of both symptomatic and asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformation (HT) associated with these treatments.
Identify predictors of HT associated with acute dabigatran treatment.

Hypothesis: The Investigators hypothesize that symptomatic HT rates in dabigatran and ASA treated patients will not be significantly different.

NCT02219035,"In patients presenting with acute stroke or transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), von Willebrand factor related parameters, including VWF antigen, activity, FVIII:c and propeptides, ADAMTS13 levels and VWF multimers in cases where ADAMTS 13 was reduced will be measured. Global haemostasis will be assessed using thrombin generation and the relation between increase thrombin generation and VWF explored. Thrombin generation will be performed pre and post filtration for the presence of procoagulant microparticles. These parameters will be investigated acutely, at presentation and in convalescence; in addition, the effect on these parameters of treatment such as thrombolysis may be informative. Correlation between measured parameters and adverse clinical outcome would be used to identify markers of severity and progression of ischaemic stroke and identification of potential novel approaches to therapy that might improve outcome."
NCT02222727,"Introduction

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is bleeding around the under surface of the brain caused by rupture of an aneurysm arising from a blood vessel. Stroke may occur in approximately one third of patients as a result of narrowing of the blood vessels around the brain, following aSAH.

One theory as to why this may happen is because bleeding around the base of the brain damages particular cells (neurons) that control blood flow around the rest of the brain. These neurons may control blood flow by releasing a neurotransmitter called Acetyl Choline (ACh). Our hypothesis is that damage to these neurons may prevent the production of ACh, which then causes reduced blood flow and stroke if left untreated.

By stimulating these neurons, we aim to investigate whether it is possible to improve the blood flow around brain and ultimately prevent strokes in patients following subarachnoid haemorrhage. Donepezil, a drug widely used in dementia, inhibits the brain's natural break down of ACh. We predict that by increasing the amount of Ach in these neurons, donepezil may improve blood flow to the brain, reducing the chance of developing stroke.

Trial Protocol

All patients admitted to St George's hospital with a confirmed aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage between the ages of 18 and 85 years old will be invited to participate in the trial. The protocol has been designed to take place around the patients' aneurysm treatment, which is performed under general anesthesia (GA). Recruited participants will be anesthetized for their aneurysm treatment and then enter the study.

All trial participants will have a Xenon CT scan under GA to assess brain blood flow prior to having treatment of their aneurysm. Patients randomized to donepezil treatment will receive a loading dose of 20mg via a feeding tube immediately after their Xenon scan. Patients in the control group will not receive the drug.

All patients in the trial will undergo repeat Xenon perfusion scanning under GA between 3 and 4 hours after their first scan, which coincides with the completion of their aneurysm treatment. Those in the donepezil group will then receive a daily dose of 5 mg for a period of 21 days.

All aspects of care other than those related to the trial will be the same as for any other subarachnoid haemorrhage patients. Patients (or their legal representative for those unable to consent) will be able to decline participation in the trial or withdraw at any point."

NCT02316119,"Background: About 5% of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have had previously ischemic stroke (IS) or transitory ischemic attack (TIA). This is a high-risk population, with a high incidence of ischemic events, and also of bleeding events. While the high ischemic risk in this population is attributed to a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, their predisposition to bleeding events is not well understood. Hypothesis: The increased bleeding risk in ACS patients with history of cerebrovascular event may be justified by a low platelet activity. Methods: Unicentric, prospective, case-control study, which included approximately 100 post-ACS patients with history of IS/TIA previously to the acute coronary event (Case Group) and 100 patients without IS/TIA (Control group). The groups were matched for gender, age, and ACS type and year of occurrence. All patients were taking aspirin, and the main exclusion criteria were use of dual antiplatelet therapy, previous hemorrhagic stroke, severe renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy. Main analysis: Platelet aggregation was evaluated by 6 methods: VerifyNow Aspirin®, VerifyNow P2Y12®, PFA 100®, thrombelastography (ReoRox®), light transmission aggregometry with ADP (LTA ADP) and epinephrine (LTA EPI) as agonists.

NCT05316896,"Stroke is a serious medical condition that causes the death of brain cells as a result of blockage of a blood vessel that feeds the brain (ischemic stroke) or bleeding in or around the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). People who have had a stroke have a higher risk of falling than people who have not had a stroke at the same age. Lack of balance control not only increases the risk of falling, but also leads to fear of falling and reduces the integration of people with stroke into society.

The central nervous system uses two main postural strategies to maintain and restore balance when perturbed. These; are anticipatory and compensatory postural adjustments. Anticipatory postural adjustments control the position of the body's center of mass by activating the trunk and leg muscles prior to a forthcoming body perturbation, thus minimizing the risk of loosing equilibrium. Compensatory postural adjustment are initiated by sensory feedback signals and serve as a mechanism of restoration of the position of the center of mass after a perturbation has already occurred.

In this study, the investigators aimed to determine which one is more effective, unlike previous studies that showed that internal and external perturbation exercises were effective when applied together. For this purpose, the researchers the planned to investigate and compare the effects on balance, performance, activity and participation in individuals to whom only internal perturbations were applied and only external perturbations were applied.

The participants will be divided into 2 groups, as Group A and Group B, with 10 participants in each group, in a randomized controlled manner.

Treatment Protocol:

Conventional treatment was applied to participants included in both groups for 4 weeks, 5 days a week, 40-minute sessions. In addition to conventional treatment, 30 minutes of perturbation-based balance training was given to the participant in the study. Participants in Group A received internal perturbation training, and participants in Group B received external perturbation training."
NCT04802772,"In France, stroke is the leading cause of non-traumatic acquired motor disability in adults, the second leading cause of major cognitive impairment, and the third leading cause of death in men and women. The average age of onset is 73 years (70 years for men, 76 years for women). All types combined, approximately 100,000 patients are hospitalized for stroke each year, approximately 40,000 people die and 30,000 have serious after-effects at one year. The spectrum of functional sequelae ranges from motor and sensory impairment to cognitive impairment; moreover, 30 to 50% of patients have a recurrence within 5 years.

Data from the Dijon Stroke Registry showed in 2011 that only 36% of people who had a stroke between 2000 and 2009 were symptom-free 1 month after the event; 22% of patients had mild or moderate disability according to the modified Rankin Scale (mRS); and 42% were unable to walk without assistance or had died. Based on 2009 self-reported data, more than one in two (51%) of those with a history of stroke with sequelae reported significant difficulty or inability to walk 500 meters; 45% had difficulty with at least one activity of daily living. The mortality rate was 44.7 per 100 000 persons in 2013.

Cerebral infarctions (CIs) account for the majority of strokes (70-75%). In 2014, despite a 12.5% decrease from 2008, hospital case fatality for CIs remained high at 9%. In 2015, the case fatality rate was 10.7% at 30 days and 11.9% at 1 year. Thirty-day mortality alone concentrated nearly half (47%) of the 1-year mortality."
NCT04726839,"Triage of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients is critical, to decrease time to treatment, and improve functional outcome. The therapeutic standard of care for AIS consecutive to large vessel occlusion (LVO) is the association of intravenous (IV) alteplase administration and mechanical thrombectomy (MT). However, there are limited places where MT can be performed. Therefore, there is a need for innovative tools to identify, in the ambulance, patients with LVO that require MT. Sending the patients at the right, avoiding futile stops (i.e. in places where MT is not available), is definitively a strategy that saves time.

There is currently no biomarker nor Point Of Care (POC) Lab Testing to solve this issue and clinical scoring methods such as the NIHSS have a low accuracy rate to detect LVO. The relevance of blood biomarkers for LVO diagnosis and therapeutic decisions needs to be confirmed for effective triage in the setting of AIS with LVO, which represent 30% of all AIS.

The main objective of our study is to determine diagnostic performances of a panel of selected blood biomarkers to identify patients with AIS consecutive to LVO among those with stroke suspicion, within 24 hours of stroke symptom's onset before brain imaging.

This could facilitate the triage of patients with LVO refractory to thrombolysis treatment, who may benefit most from MT."

NCT04726007,"Stroke is an independent risk factor for venous thrombosis (VTE), which leads to a significant increase in the mortality and disability rate after stroke. For patients with high risk factors for VTE such as advanced age, paralysis, infection, dehydration, etc., the incidence of death and disability is higher. Studies have shown that the incidence of deep vein thrombosis in bedridden ischemic stroke patients is about 20%, and the incidence of pulmonary embolism is about 2%, and causes 10% of post-stroke deaths. In order to prevent the occurrence of VTE, the American Heart Association, the American Stroke Association, the Cerebrovascular Disease Group of the Neurology Branch of the Chinese Medical Association, etc. pointed out in the guidelines that heparin or low molecular weight heparin should be used for stroke patients with ""restricted mobility"" or ""incapable mobility"" to prevent VTE. For patients with evidence of thrombosis or symptoms of DVT, antithrombotic therapy should be initiated immediately. Paradoxically, ischemic stroke significantly increases the risk of cerebral hemorrhage. Besides There is an increased risk of primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) associated with aspirin or antiplatelet agent monotherapy and it is difficult to achieve a balance between preventing blood clots and reducing the risk of bleeding complications. In addition, stroke patients are elderly and have speech and intellectual impairment, and the non-specific symptoms and signs of intracranial hemorrhage caused by improper antithrombotic therapy make the rate of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis extremely high. Therefore, clarifying the clinical characteristics of stroke patients with VTE and launching targeted interventions to effectively balance the risk of anti-thrombosis and bleeding have become the key to improving the prognosis of patients.

This study is based on real-world data to study the bleeding risk and antithrombotic treatment options in VaS (1) the risk factors associated with hemorrhage in patients with VTE after stroke; and (2) the characteristics and pharmacotherapeutics regimen of high-risk populations with VTE after stroke; and(3) the Optimal antithrombotic treatment regimen for patients with VTE after stroke, including the timing of starting and stopping the antithrombotic treatment, selection of varieties, dosage, and course of treatment, etc."

Each subject will undergo 18-sessions (~1 month) FES training. Participants will utilize the theory of muscle synergies from motor neurosciences, which are defined as neural modules of motor control that coordinate the spatiotemporal activation patterns of multiple muscles, to guide our personal selections of muscles for FES. It is hypothesized that chronic stroke survivors will learn from FES stimulations, over several daily sessions, both by suppressing the original abnormal muscle synergies and by employing the normal muscle synergies as specified in the FES. It is also expected that the walk synergies of the paretic side of chronic stroke survivors should be more similar to healthy muscle synergies at the two post-training time points than before training."
NCT04152616,"One of the causes of disability in stroke patients is postural disturbances that result in postural asymmetry in the standing position, characterized during an evaluation on a force platform by a greater displacement of the center of pressure towards the lesion side and thus by a greater percentage of weight on the lower limb (Weight -Bearing Asymmetry (WBA)). Today, the mechanisms of balance disorders in standing position are better understood. Indeed, in addition to sensory and motor deficits, spatial cognitive disorders also contribute to these postural disturbances, particularly in right brain damage stroke. This would be the reason why patients with right brain damage have a more precarious and time-consuming balance to re-educate than patients with lesions located in the left hemisphere.

Postural disturbances can also result in a disturbance of balance in the sitting position, which is a poor prognosis for the acquisition of transfers, standing and walking. To date, seated postural disturbances are not perfectly described with many differences in the explanatory mechanisms found in the literature. Thus, some people notice a more pronounced asymmetry on the medio-lateral plane while others find a more pronounced imbalance at the antero-posterior plane.

Sitting posture disorders benefit from few instrumental measurement tools outside clinical measurement scales. A very wide variety of evaluation methods by instrumental measurements are proposed and not validated. Sensor pad, which are usually used to adjust the bases of pressure ulcer patients, may be useful in quantifying the postural balance. But since the involvement of the head and trunk in the sitting posture is well documented in the literature, the addition of an evaluation of the position of the trunk and head seems essential. To our knowledge, no author has proposed to quantify sitting balance disorders by combining a measure of support asymmetry by taking into account the posture of the trunk with that of the head."

NCT03570281,"Purpose: Cancer-related hypercoagulability plays an important role in the development of cancer-related stroke. With rapidly aging population and increasing cancer prevalence, cancer related stroke has become an important stroke subtype. Recent studies suggest that hypercoagulability is associated with poor prognosis and effective correction of coagulopathy maybe protective for survival in cancer related stroke patients. Optimal strategies to correct coagulopathy in cancer stroke patient remains to be determined. Currently, the use of low molecular-weighted heparin is recommended in these patients, but non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) could be safe alternative without the need for injection subcutaneously. Furthermore, NOACs could be an optimal treatment strategy for cancer-related stroke in terms of correcting coagulopathy with less injection related complication (ex. pain and infection) compared to Enoxaparin."

By the functional recovery of stroke patients, findings of brain image and brain mapping, it could enhance the understanding the TS influences on brain reorganization. Regarding with clinical application of the TS intervention for improving functional performance of upper extremity in participants with stroke, the best parameters of TS intervention in clinical practice have not been decided.

NCT04399200,"This prospective cohort study aims to compare the proportion of cardiac or cerebrovascular events after a first stroke, a first transient ischemic attack (TIA) or recurrent TIA, between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and non-SDB (control) patients, one year after SDB diagnosis, performed 3 months after stroke onset.

The primary outcome is a composite endpoint composed of cardiac or cerebrovascular events regrouping: death from any cardiac or cerebrovascular cause, non-fatal stroke, and non-fatal acute coronary disease.

1620 patients, in the acute phase of a first stroke, TIA or recurrent TIA will be included in the cohort.

Clinical, neuroimaging, sensorimotor, cognitive and biological parameters will be collected at inclusion. Three months after stroke or TIA onset, polysomnography will be performed for SDB diagnosis. Patients will be considered as having SDB for an Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) > 15 events/hour, or to the control group otherwise. The same clinical, imaging, cognitive and biological assessments than during the first visit will be performed; incident (new) cardiovascular events will be collected. Three months later, and at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years after SDB diagnosis, the same clinical, cognitive, sensorimotor, and sleep-related evaluations will be performed. In addition to the aforementioned parameters, incident cardiovascular outcomes will be collected, at the same time points. The primary study outcome will be retrieved one year after stroke onset."

NCT03199833,"Stroke is the third most common cause of death and the main cause of acquired adult disability in high-income countries. The most common deficit after stroke is motor impairment of the contralateral arm, with more than 80% of stroke survivors experiencing this condition in the acute phase, and only half regaining some useful upper limb function after six months.

Within the European project RETRAINER (grant agreement No 644721), the consortium developed a platform for the rehabilitation of the upper limb after stroke, which combines a passive forearm-hand orthosis for hand-wrist motion stabilization, selective fingers constraining and grasp movement facilitation, Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) of the extrinsic hand flexor muscles and of the extrinsic hand extensor muscles, interactive objects, and voluntary effort. The system also provides a graphical user interface which helps the therapist set the training session and save the training data and parameters, and provides the subject a visual feedback about his/her active involvement in the exercise. The training consists of the execution of a series of exercises involving the affected arm during daily life activities. Typical exercises include controlled wrist flexion and extension, controlled fingers flexion and extension, anterior reaching and grasping on a plane or in the space, moving an object on a plane or in the space.

The aim of this clinical study it to evaluate the efficacy of this novel training platform on patients between two weeks and nine months after their first stroke, who preserved at least a visible muscle contraction for the arm and shoulder muscles. Participants are randomized in an experimental and a control group. The control group is trained with an advanced rehabilitative program, including physical training, occupational therapy, FES, and virtual reality, while the experimental group is trained with the RETRAINER system for about 30 minutes, in addition to the same program of the control group. The daily training time is the same for the two groups. The intervention consists of three sessions a week for nine weeks. Patients are assessed at baseline, soon after the end of the intervention, and in a 4-week follow-up visits. It is planned to recruit 68 subjects for this study. Since the RETRAINER platform was built on the up-to-date theory of motor re-learning, which supports task-oriented repetitive training, a close temporal association between motor intention and stimulated motor response, and an intensive and frequent training paradigm, the study's hypothesis is that the experimental group shows a greater treatment effect than the control group."

NCT03379532,"Stroke patients with severe upper limb movement deficits have limited treatment options and often remain severely handicapped at the chronic stage.

Recent findings have suggested that poor motor recovery can be due to severe damage of the cortico-spinal tract (CST), the neural fibres connecting the movement regions of the brain to the spinal cord. Hence, to improve recovery of upper limb movements it will be crucial to re-establish and strengthen CST projections.

Recent studies provided evidence that closed-loop brain computer interface-driven electrical stimulation of the paretic muscles can induce clinically important and lasting recovery of upper limb function, even in patients with chronic, severe motor affection. In this treatment approach, movement intentions of the patients are detected with electroencephalography and real-time analyses. This triggers an electrical stimulation of affected upper limb muscles.

In this study, the investigators hypothesize that neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) applied contingent to voluntary activation of primary motor cortex, as detected by a brain-computer interface (BCI), can help restore CST projections. This might improve recovery of patients with severe upper limb movement deficits. Treatment will be started within the first 8 weeks after stroke onset."

NCT03273101,"Background: It is unknown whether the self-initiated sit-to-stand training with assistive device is effective to regain the independence of sit-to-stand in stroke patients.

Objective: To compare the effectiveness of self-initiated sit-to-stand training by assistive device, with manual sit-to-stand training.

Design: Parallel randomised controlled and assessor blinded trial between Jan 2015 and May 2018. Randomisation was performed by drawing lots to allocate treatment to patient.

Setting: A rehabilitation hospital in Hong Kong

Participants: 69 patients in medical wards with unilateral hemiparetic stroke. 52 patients fulfilled the study requirements.

Intervention: Ten sessions of intervention with conventional physiotherapy program followed, by self-initiated sit-to-stand training with assistive device, or by manual sit-to-stand training.

Main outcome measure: Number of patients regained the independence of sit-to-stand, Sit-to-stand test from the balance master® and Five-repetitions sit-to-stand test.

Results: 69 patients (intervention n=36; control n=33) were randomized (mean age 69.8 (SD, 10.6), mean post stroke days 18.6 (SD 16.0)) for intention to treat analysis. 17 patients were excluded because of dropout before 10 sessions of training, leaving 52 (n=26; n=26) patients for per protocol analysis. 18 patients in intervention group and 10 patients in control group had regained the independence of sit-to-stand (Phil and Cramer's V: -0.31 and 0.31). The patients in intervention group were faster to complete the Five-repetition sit-to-stand test than the control group (32.7 secs (SD, 1.93) v 48.4 secs (SD, 6.8); 95% confidence interval, -30.8 to -0.7; p<0.05). No adverse side effects occurred during and after the training across groups.

Conclusions: Self-initiated sit-to-stand training by assistive device can help more stroke patients regain the independence of sit-to-stand."

It is fun and engaging and may encourage the user to do more exercise. VRT is increasingly being used for rehabilitation after stroke. Patients often require ongoing therapy post-discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Outpatient therapy may be unavailable due to waiting lists, transportation issues, distance etc.; therefore, home-based VRT may be the answer. Our objectives are to determine: 1) the feasibility of home-based VRT for stroke patients after discharge from hospital-based rehabilitation, and 2) the feasibility of a battery of outcome measures.

Because data on the early anticoagulation in patients with AF-related stroke are limited, the investigators decided to perform a pilot study before establishing an appropriate clinical trial protocol. This study will help estimate the efficacy and safety of early administration of edoxaban, and determine the sample size of a following clinical trial.

NCT02473549,"Many individuals are often left with problems moving their arm and hand, months to even years after a stroke. Recent progress in research suggests the application of non-invasive brain stimulation, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS), in conjunction with rehabilitation exercises can further improve a person's ability to move after stroke. However, the problem is that this doesn't work for everyone, and researchers do not know why. One reason may be that TDCS is currently applied using a one-size-fits-all approach. Researchers apply the same type of TDCS to everyone, assuming the stroke affects everyone in the same way. But, researchers know this is not the case. For example, each person will likely have different amounts of damage to brain regions that control movements. A better understanding of how the stroke uniquely affects a person's brain will help us to know which is the correct type of TDCS to apply for that person. Therefore, the objective of this research is to determine whether the amount of damage to brain regions that control movements can predict which type of TDCS will be more effective to help a person improve their ability to move. Participants will undergo 1 session of magnetic resonance imaging, and three sessions of TDCS."

NCT01502683,"One of the most devastating complications of coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) is postoperative stroke. While there are multiple causes of stroke after CABG, particles generated during handling of the aorta is believed to account for most neurologic effects. Handling of the aorta during CABG occurs several times during the operation. One strategy to reduce aortic handling is to avoid cardiopulmonary bypass altogether by using off-pump techniques (OPCAB). Another method is to avoid the use of aortic clamps and/or to use devices that do not require aortic clamping. This study will test the hypothesis that an off-pump (OPCAB) approach and devices to perform clampless surgery will result in the least amount of aortic handling and therefore the lowest incidence and frequency of neurologic adverse events."
NCT02232867,"It has been found that arm and leg cycling is similar to walking in terms of the muscle activation patterns and joint ranges of motion. In addition, arm and leg cycling and walking activate similar neural pathways. Another advantage of arm and leg cycling is that it involves coordination of all four limbs in a rhythmic movement. This may be particularly beneficial given previous findings that arm movement contributes to the activation of leg muscles during walking in humans. This is achieved with interconnected neural pathways that link the arms to the legs. These neural interlimb connections remain intact in stroke victims, such that maximizing the contribution of the arms to the legs may increase coordination for walking. Thus, the objectives of this research are to determine if arm and leg cycling can be used to increase the strength of interlimb connections and if this helps to improve walking ability in a post-stroke population. It is hypothesized that arm and leg cycling will transfer to improvements in walking in a post stroke population."

NCT03749057,"Anticoagulant treatment for non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) associated with cerebral infarction/ TIA is one of the recognized treatment of stroke prevention. The ACC/AHA and national guidelines for the management of anticoagulation recommend that most of AF patients with cerebral infarction or TIA should be administrated anticoagulant therapy within 14 days of symptom onset, while European guidelines recommend that the timing of the initiation of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for AF patients with cerebral infarction or TIA is association with stroke severity in light of the ""1-3-6-12"" principle. However, there are still many problems about the use of NOACs in ischemic stroke with AF. for example, it is unclear what time to begin NOACs as to difference in stroke severity, ages, comorbidity with hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, liver and kidney dysfunction and bleeding risks. Thus, the timing of the initiation of NOACs is yet to be further studied. Current urgent need is to develop a guideline-based specific regimen in which the benefit-risk factors are further balanced with a combination of NHISS, CHA2DS2-VASC and HAS-BLED score.

Rivaroxaban, a direct coagulation factor Ⅹa inhibitor, blocks the formation of the clot. ROCKET-AF study has shown that the efficacy of rivaroxaban is not inferior to that of warfarin in AF patients on stroke prevention, and rivaroxaban has a significantly decreased bleeding risk compared with warfarin. Recent study indicates that early administration with rivaroxaban for AF patients within 14 days of onset does not significantly increase hemorrhagic transformation. However, the relevant clinical data of the efficacy and safety of early initiation of rivaroxaban in AF patients with cerebral infarction or TIA are lacking in China.

All these robotic devices have been applied in stroke rehabilitation and their efficacy are evaluated, but the scientific evidence for the mechanisms of RT-induced recovery, the relative treatment effects of unilateral vs bilateral robotic trainings, and the impact on physiological responses is still lacking.

The primary purposes of this study are to examine (1) the relative immediate treatment effects of unilateral vs bilateral RT on motor impairments/performance and daily functions in patients with subacute stroke; (2) the long-term benefits of unilateral vs bilateral RT by conducting a 6-month follow up evaluation; and (3) the effects of RT on movement reorganization as well as on the physiological markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, erythrocyte deformability, and blood glucose.

NCT01847157,"Background and purpose:

About 30% of people with stroke suffered from severe long-term upper extremity （UE） motor impairment. Severe UE impairment, especially dysfunction of hand, can greatly impact stroke patients' daily living independence and quality of life. However, treatment effect of current interventions is still limited. Nick Ward and Leonardo Cohen suggested 5 intervention strategies for stroke motor recovery: （1） reduction of somatosensory input from the intact; （2） increase in somatosensory input from the paretic; （3） anesthesia of a body part proximal to the paretic hand; （4） activity within the affected motor cortex may be up-regulated; （5） activity within the intact motor cortex may be down-regulated. Recent studies have shown each strategy to be effective in stroke patients with mild or moderate UE impairment. However, evidence for people with severe UE impairment after stroke remains unclear. Since research has found a greater effect for combined strategies than a single strategy, this proposal develops a combined intervention with the above 5 strategies, named ""transcranial direct current stimulation （tDCS） combined sensory modulation intervention"". This intervention is expected to be most effective for people with severe UE impairment after stroke.

In addition, neuroimaging can provide in vivo information about the brain plasticity which underpinning the motor recovery after stroke. However, image indexes that can be used in stroke patients with severe UE impairment remained examined. Therefore, this proposal has 3 aims: （1） to examine the treatment effect of the ""tDCS combined sensory modulation intervention"" in stroke patients with severe UE impairment; （2） to examine the underline mechanism of the efficacy of ""tDCS combined sensory modulation intervention"" using neuroimaging technology.

Methods:

This study is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial which will recruit 60 people who have had stroke onset more than 6 months and have severe UE motor impairment. All participants will be randomly assigned into 2 groups. The experimental group will be given the ""tDCS combined sensory modulation intervention"", combining bilateral tDCS stimulation, anesthesia techniques and repetitive passive motor training. The control group is given sham tDCS, sham anesthesia and repetitive passive motor training. Each group will be evaluated for outcomes at 4 time points （i.e. baseline, post-intervention, 3 months and 6months post-intervention）. The immediate and long-term effect of the interventions will be examined.

Primary outcome indicators include upper extremity impairment measures. Secondary outcome measures include upper extremity function, activities of daily living function, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging （fMRI）, and corticospinal tract structural integrity using diffusion spectrum imaging （DSI）. Fifteen subjects of each group will be assessed 2 times （i.e., prior to the intervention and after the intervention） for fMRI and DSI scan.

Anticipatory results and contributions:

The results of the studies are expected to present a potentially effective intervention for stroke patients with severe impaired UE motor. Imaging evidence of brain plasticity for this particular intervention is also provided. The results will contribute to our understanding of brain plasticity for UE motor recovery after stroke. Findings from this proposal may help researchers and clinicians choose or develop interventions that are optimal to their clients individually."

Working Hypothesis:

The outpatient rehabilitation program results in a significant short (3 months) and long-term (1 year) improvement of vascular risk factors, neurological functions, exercise capacity, adherence to vasoprotective medication and health related quality of life.

Experimental design/Methods:

This is a prospective, randomized clinical trial. At least 100 patients will be randomized either to the interventional group or to a group which is treated only by the family physician. All patients will be assessed at baseline, at 3 months and 1 year. The primary outcome is the number of reached cardiovascular health goals (6 metrics) between the interventional group and the group which is treated only by the family physician.

Expected value of the proposed project:

The study has the potential to show that an outpatient rehabilitation program significantly improves vascular risk factors, adherence to medication, enhances quality of life and eventually reduces recurrent strokes and other vascular events. If this is confirmed, introducing outpatient rehabilitation programs will have a major socioeconomic impact."

NCT02089776,"Background:

- People can learn to use feedback about brain activity to change that activity. Researchers want to see if people who have had a stroke can change their brain activity by practice and thought with feedback, and if that improves motor control. They will study brain activity in people who have and have not had strokes.

Objectives:

- To see if people with stroke can change their brain activity and improve motor control by practice and thought.

Eligibility:

Adults 18 80 years old who have had a stroke.
Healthy volunteers 18 80 years old.

Design:

Participants will be screened with a medical history, MRI, and physical exam. For MRI, a magnetic field and radio waves take pictures of the brain. Participants lie on a table that slides in and out of a cylinder. They will be in the scanner less than 2 hours, lying still for up to 15 minutes at a time. The scanner makes loud noises. Participants will get earplugs.
Participants will have up to 3 scanning visits and up to 3 follow-up visits within 24 weeks. Visits may include screening, MRI, functional MRI (fMRI), questionnaires, and simple motor tests. Stroke participants may take additional motor tests, including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
fMRI: During this MRI, small metal disks may be taped to the skin or a fabric glove with small wires in it may be used to monitor hand movements. Heart rate and breathing may also be monitored. Participants may be monitored by video and asked to perform tasks.
TMS: A brief electrical current goes through a coil on the scalp. It creates a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. Participants may be asked to perform simple actions. Finger or hand movements may be recorded."

NCT01967290,"The objective of this study is to determine the impact of vibratory feedback on the quality and intensity of a common motor rehabilitation task of the upper-arm (hand-to-mouth) in stroke patients. For that purpose the investigators use the SWORD system that combines 3D motion quantification wearable sensors and a vibratory module.

The investigators hypothesize that vibratory stimuli during a motor rehabilitation task increase significantly the number of correct movements performed per unit of time.

The design of the study is a cross-over randomized clinical trial. With the SWORD system in place each patient will perform the hand-to-mouth task twice (with vibratory feedback and without it), the order being random. The number of correct movements and other motor outcomes will be assessed continuously under both conditions."

NCT02018406,"The purpose of our study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the combination of erythropoietin (EPO) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) in patients with neurological diseases. To be specific, our clinical study is expected that the combination injection of EPO and G-CSF shows neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects by facilitating endogenous repair process in patients with neurological diseases including stroke, cerebral palsy, or atypical parkinsonism. Therefore, we will apply our original treatment technique in patients with neurological diseases, which is expected to overcome current ethical and technical limitations of less evidenced functional recovery, hematological changes, and side effects. Eventually, We will establish a comprehensive clinical background about neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects of this hematopoietic growth factors therapy."

NCT04202549,"Thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy are the most efficient treatments for acute ischemic stroke patients in time window. Although sufficient recanalization after thrombectomy is more than 80%, HERMES study indicated that nearly half of the ischemic stroke patients under thrombectomy suffered obvious disability. Artery reocclusion, hemorrhagic transformation, and no-reflow phenomenon are among the most important reasons of poor prognosis of acute ischemic stroke patients. The investigators speculate that a combination of argatroban, edaravone, and glucocorticoid may be helpful in preventing artery reocclusion, hemorrhagic transformation, and no-reflow phenomenon. This study intends to explore the safety, feasibility and efficacy of thrombectomy with sufficient recanalization bridged by intra-arterial cocktail therapy in acute ischemic stroke patients."
NCT04655937,"Stroke survivors face a range of mental health challenges adjusting post-stroke. There is a lack of treatment options and clinical psychologist workforce to deliver support. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been used successfully in clinical services to improve wellbeing.

The investigators worked with stroke survivors, health care professionals and researchers to develop group ACT therapy, specifically for stroke survivors, to be delivered using video calling (Zoom). Staff training and supervision programmes were also developed to equip Stroke Association workforce (paraprofessionals) to deliver ACT.

The current study will recruit and train up to 10 paraprofessionals with some experience of supporting stroke survivors.

The study aims to recruit up to 60 stroke survivors in the community who are at least 4 months post-stroke and experiencing distress adjusting to their stroke. The investigators aimed to make everything accessible for people with mild/moderate difficulties with thinking and communicating. Recruitment takes place across England, over a 12 month period.

The study will test how feasible and acceptable it is to deliver our remote ACT intervention to stroke survivors, using a 'modified randomised consent' design that involves two levels of consent for stroke survivors:

The first level is agreement to complete online measures of well-being every 3 months for up to 12 months (taking around 20 minutes), with the option to participate in groups. Those who don't opt for groups will not be treated but will be followed up about their wellbeing.
Those who opt to attend groups will be randomly allocated to attend either the ACT intervention or an active control group, involving social support. Both groups involve 8 weekly sessions and homework.

Data will be collected on how successfully the groups are delivered and how acceptable they are / how to improve them, through online surveys, feedback questionnaires and interviews."
NCT04654793,"Among subacute stroke patients (within 4 weeks after the onset), patients who are unable to walk are divided into experimental groups and control groups, and conventional rehabilitation treatment including physical therapy and occupational therapy is performed for 4 weeks or more in all groups.

Robot assisted inclined bed treatment and FES were performed, and the control group performed conventional inclined bed treatment.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of robot-assisted inclined bed treatment by tracking observation and comparative analysis of the lower limb function, gait ability, bone density and muscle mass of each group.

Patients appropriate for the selection criteria are divided into experimental group and control group in random permuted blocks to conduct the study. In the experimental group, FES was performed at the same time as the robot-assisted inclined bed treatment once a day for 30 minutes, 5 days a week for 4 weeks, and the control group performed conventional inclined bed treatment for 30 minutes once a day for 4 weeks, 5 days a week. Separately from this in all groups, functional electrical stimulation treatment is performed once a day in the area except the lower extremities.

Based on the behavioral intention test (BIT) test and the Mini-Mental Screening Examination test (MMSE) test for the group of unilateral neglected patients with stroke findings among all eligible patients for this experiment.

Appropriate subjects are selected and randomly divided into two groups. One group uses an afferent virtual reality program, and the other uses an efferent virtual reality program to train five times a week for a total of 4 weeks.

Before training, a computer experience scale 21 was additionally performed, and to find out the degree of unilateral negligence, evaluation was performed using the Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT) and Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS)22, and the angle of deflection (deviation angle), out-of-focus time, gaze time, failure rate, and head rotation trajectory were evaluated. In addition, reaction time, failure rate, and head rotation trajectory were evaluated using a virtual reality program (Assessment program-V2) to evaluate the degree of unilateral negligence.

NCT04638192,"tACS has the potential to directly induce cortical alterations in the intrinsic neural oscillation at specific frequencies, and the brain could mirror the induced frequencies of the external source of oscillations from the stimulation. Hence, tACS with matching stimulation frequency could be an effective means of enhancing brain oscillatory activity to potentially induce synaptic plasticity for restoration of damaged brain functions. However from the existing studies of applying tACS over the M1 in healthy and diseased brains, there is a wide range of applied stimulation frequencies and varied neuromodulation effects on motor behavior or cortical excitability at different frequencies. In this proposal, subject-specific stimulation frequency and latency will be identified."

NCT05148663,"Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), one of the most common microvascular malformations in the capillary beds of the brain, are susceptible to hemorrhagic stroke. As an autosomal dominant disorder with incomplete penetrance, the majority of CCM gene mutation carriers are largely asymptomatic but when symptoms occur, the disease has typically reached the stage of focal hemorrhage with irreversible brain damage. Currently, the invasive neurosurgery removal of CCM lesions is the only treatment option, despite the recurrence of the symptoms after surgery. Therefore, there is a grave need for prognostic/monitoring biomarkers as risk predictors for stroke prevention. The objective of the proposal is to develop a set of blood prognostic/monitoring biomarkers as precise risk indicators for stroke prevention. In this project, the plan is to validate the novel serum biomarkers identified in Ccms animal models and human CCMs patients, and utilize these biomarkers with statistical algorithms for risk prediction of hemorrhagic CCMs. This proposal has been formulated based on recent findings of five serum etiological biomarkers associated with disruption of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), the first step for hemorrhagic CCMs in Ccm mice models. This work will lay the groundwork for larger human trials for final validation and revolutionary potential clinical applications."

NCT04477252,"Introduction: Stroke continues to be one of the leading causes of disability in the Spanish adult population with the presentation of impairments such as alteration of mobility and a consequent reduction in quality of life. These sequelae, generally chronic, generates a significant expense and saturation of social and health services. With the growth in the number of cases, the development of new rehabilitation approaches and updating of the social context becomes pertinent, such as the incorporation of telerehabilitation to assist individuals with stroke.

Objectives: To analyze adherence to physical rehabilitation by mobile App and to evaluate the effectiveness of lumbopelvic stability exercises performed at home with the App.

Material and methods: Randomized controlled single blind pilot study (n = 30). Participants with Stroke (<6 months) will be randomized between two groups (App for carrying out lumbopelvic stability exercises + usual treatment versus usual treatment). The study will last 3 months and App adherence, Quality Of Life, participation in Daily Life, functionality, sitting balance, standing balance and gait will be taken as variables.

Expected results: It is thought that the use of an App can contribute to rehabilitation in its chronic phase, monitorization and fallow-up the clinical evolution of the patient. Even if chronicity leads us to think about the stabilization of the physical condition, It is thought that the best results will be found among the subjects who will use the App."

NCT04119544,"Hemiparesis is a common motor disorder after a stroke. The majority of patients do not recover functional use of their paretic upper limb.

The use of mirror therapy allows the activation of the mirror neurons involved to stimulate brain plasticity after brain damage.The IVS (Intensive Visual Stimulation) device allows an easy implementation of mirror therapy by filming the valid upper limb and projecting the inverted image onto a screen placed above the parietal arm thus producing the illusion of movement of the parietal arm.

The main hypothesis of this study is that the structured practice of a large number of upper limb targeted movement repetitions using an intensive visual numerical simulation device as a partial replacement for routine care (conventional occupational therapy) in the sub-acute phase of stroke will increase the active function (motor function and functional abilities) of the distal end of the upper limb compared to conventional rehabilitation.

Objectives: This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of partial substitution of routine care (occupational therapy) by structured movement repetition programs by Intensive Visual Simulation using an IVS3 device, on the distal motor control of the upper hemiparesis limb, between 4 and 10 weeks after the stroke, compared to a program with conventional care alone."

NCT05606770,"Despite recent advances in acute stroke intervention, secondary prevention strategies are lacking. Physical activity (PA) is the second largest predictor of stroke and the cornerstone of secondary prevention therapies. Adaptive interventions involve sequential treatments responsive to individuals' performance. Despite guidelines to adapt PA to individuals' needs, there is no evidence on the empirical development of adaptive PA interventions post-stroke. The evidence is dominated by standard trial designs, used to evaluate non-adaptive PA interventions. This trial will make original contributions to the literature by designing a first-in-class adaptive PA intervention using an innovative experimental design. This design will permit the delivery of optimal sequences of treatments to increase PA for individuals. Furthermore, by developing a user-informed smartphone application, this feasibility trial will lead to the design and evaluation of a highly-scalable definitive intervention to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke.

Aim To use a Sequential Multiple-Assignment Randomised Trial (SMART) design to develop an adaptive, user-informed mobile health (mHealth) intervention to improve PA post-stroke. Subsequently this adaptive intervention will be evaluated against a treatment-as-usual control using a standard trial design in a definitive trial.

Methods A co-design process was used to develop the technology platform for intervention delivery. There are two components which target increased PA in the current intervention: Structured Exercise and Lifestyle PA. The SMART will determine what sequence and/or combination of these intervention components produces the greatest increase in physical activity as measured by average daily step count. The primary outcome will be PA (steps/day), with clear feasibility and secondary clinical and cost outcomes. A SMART design will be used to evaluate the optimum adaptive PA intervention among people post-mild-to-moderate stroke."

Reperfusion therapies of the occluded artery remain the only useful approach in acute ischemic stroke. However, the efficacy of these strategies is highly time-dependent and due to the need of neuroimaging (CT or MRI) to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, impossible to be performed at the pre-hospital level. The investigators aim to set-up a point of-care (POC) device to validate a biomarker panel differentiating ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke at the pre-hospital level using a blood sample and to validate a second biomarker panel for the early identification of patients with large vessel occlusions (LVO), which are candidates for mechanical thrombectomy.

NCT01423201,"Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a transient neurological deficit (speech disturbance, weakness…), caused by temporary occlusion of a brain vessel by a blood clot that leaves no lasting effect.

TIA diagnosis can be challenging and an expert stroke evaluation combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could improve the diagnosis accuracy.

The risk of a debilitating stroke can be as high as 5% during the first 72 hrs after TIA.

TIA characteristics (duration, type of symptoms, age of the patient), the presence of a significant narrowing of the neck vessels responsible for the patient's symptoms (symptomatic stenosis), and an abnormal MRI are associated with an increased risk of stroke.

An emergent evaluation and treatment of TIA patients by a stroke specialist could reduce the risk of stroke to 2%.

Stanford has implemented an expedited triage pathway for TIA patients combining a clinical evaluation by a stroke neurologist, an acute MRI of the brain and the vessels and a sampling of biomarkers (Lp-PLA2). The investigators are investigating the yield of this unique approach to improve TIA diagnosis, prognosis and secondary stroke prevention. The objective of this prospective cohort study is to determine which factors will help the physician to confirm the diagnosis of TIA and to define the risk of stroke after a TIA."
NCT03508037,"Strokes are caused by a bleed in the brain and can be life threatening. One common consequence is upper limb impairment. This causes stroke patients to be unable to use their arms and upper body to do simple tasks such as reaching or grasping. Currently, people with stroke undergo rehabilitation, which is usually done through a physical and occupational (daily living skills) therapies to improve their mobility (movement) with their upper limbs. However, this kind of treatment has limitations and often cannot help patients regain total mobility. There are alternative rehabilitation treatments that use new methods and technologies that may be able to help patients with stroke. Neuromodulaton therapies using brain-computer interfaces (BCI), which connects brain signals directly to a computer, have the potential to help patients. This type of therapy uses assistive devices such as electrical stimulation (electrical shocks or waves) and robots to help restore function to the areas affected by stroke.

NCT04607031,"Early outcome prediction after ischemic stroke (IS) is of great importance. Prognosis is usually based on clinical variables and neuroradiological findings while serum biomarkers may contribute to prognostic accuracy. Inflammatory biomarker Suppression of Tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) has been shown as promising in IMU outcome predicting. The relationship between ST2 serum values and IS severity is not fully clarified. The proposed hypothesis is that earlier releasing and higher ST2 serum concentrations will be associated with a worse IS outcome. In this prospective and observational study 20 patients with IS will be included and followed. The primary outcome is functional outcome according to the modified Ranking scale at 90 days. In case of hypothesis confirmation, theoretical contribution will be in a better understanding of pathophysiological changes in acute phase of IS, while the clinical purpose is to improve the prognostic procedure."
NCT05192161,"Stroke is a public health issue and a priority for our institution. MRI plays an essential role in the management of stroke. In this context, the contribution of MRI is diagnostic, etiological and prognostic.

Among the MRI parameters evaluated in the acute phase of the stroke, the evaluation of the mismatch between the DIFFUSION and FLAIR sequences is crucial as it will directly contribute to the therapeutic decision. A FLAIR-diffusion mismatch, i.e., a lesion with a diffusion but not a FLAIR hypersignal, identifies patients whose time of onset of symptoms is probably less than 4.5 hours. It is therefore understandable that the main arterial recanalization techniques performed in the acute phase are primarily reserved for patients with a positive mismatch.

In current practice, mismatch assessment is performed subjectively, by visually comparing the two sequences, which is known to be the cause of a lack of reproducibility and diagnostic performance.

Computational medical imaging techniques (""radiomics"") have recently gained momentum and offer the prospect of automated and therefore more reproducible analysis of medical imaging data. In stroke patients, radiomics extracted from FLAIR imaging could thus contribute to describe the ""diffusion flair"" mismatch in a continuous and objective way.

For the time being, data analysis cannot be performed in real time due to technical constraints. If it is proven that radiomics can reliably analyze the mismatch on the FLAIR sequence alone, the next step will be to make the analysis feasible in clinical routine (i.e. in a time frame adapted to the therapeutic management)."

Low serum-mg-concentrations are associated with cognitive impairments in ischemic stroke patients one month after stroke onset. It is not clear, if cognitive impairments after stroke is caused by the mg-deficiency or by the stroke itself. Until now, no studies investigating the relationship between mg-concentration, stroke severity and cognition during treatment course are available. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between mg-concentration and cognition of stroke patients."
NCT03502460,"The possibility of exploring the lungs by lung ultrasound, a non-invasive tool, is becoming increasingly popular for anesthesiologists. Recently, Lichtenstein has described the FALLS protocol (Fluid Administration Limited by Lung Sonography) which uses the potential of pulmonary ultrasound to evaluate early pulmonary overload due to fluid administration at a subclinical stage. Indeed, fluid administration can generate a sub-clinical interstitial syndrome that can be detected by passing from a profile A to a profile B in lung ultrasound. The transition from a profile A to a profile B therefore corresponds to the transition from a state of preload dependent to a state of preload independence. However, this tool has not been studied in the operating room. The main objective of this study will be to study the correlation between pulmonary ultrasound and SV variation measured by esophageal Doppler during fluid administration in patients with haemodynamic optimisation in the operating room during digestive, urological, gynecological and orthopedic surgeries. The main expected result is the following: good correlation between the absence of increased SV in the esophageal Doppler and the appearance of a B-profile lung ultrasound fluid administration in the operating room."

NCT01249287,"A growing number of studies highlight the potential of stem cell transplantation as a novel therapeutic approach for stroke in animal model. But the stem cell therapy for chronic stroke patients has not been well investigated yet. In this study, the investigators will test the hypothesis that intracerebral peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell (CD34+) (PBSC) transplantation induces neuroplasticity in chronic stroke patients. The remyelination of corticospinal tract in the lesion side, focal increased perfusion and increased cortical activity in the peri-infarcted area will be monitored by the functional MRI after stem cell therapy. The investigators study is aimed to find the potential mechanisms of the functional recovery after stem cell implantation.

NCT04574037,"The prediction of motor recovery in the acute phase of stroke is crucial for several clinical reasons: (i) informing the patient and his relatives, (ii) helping to identify the patient's endorsement (return home or rehabilitation) as well as the adaptation of the rehabilitation program to what can be expected from it. To date, an algorithm (decision tree) proposed by C. Stinear's team named PREP2 is the best predictive tool with 75% of patients well classified at 3 months. It predicts the functional recovery of the upper limb after stroke 3 months before the episode by categorizing recovery as ""excellent"", ""good"", ""limited"" as well as ""minor"" (poor). With two data (SAFE score, age) or three (SAFE score, Motor evoked potential, NIHSS), the prediction is effective three times out of 4. In the study we are proposing ""PREP-UCV"", we would like to validate this algorithm as it is with patients in our active file who are victims of stroke. The expected accuracy is 75% or more. As a secondary objective, we would like to confirm that we find the same algorithm starting from the initial data from PREP 2 (side of the stroke, type of stroke (ischemic and / or hemorrhagic), involvement of the corticospinal tract on MRI, sex at birth ) as well as two other factors which are also very important: cognitive status (dysexecutive / aphasia / neglect), as well as the neutrophils on lymphocytes ratio."
NCT03558659,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been found to be very common in stroke patients. Obstructive sleep apnea has been found to impede stroke rehabilitation and recovery. However, currently, there are few treatment options for OSA in stroke patients. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the current therapy commonly used for OSA in the general population, however stroke patients are not highly compliant with this device. Therefore, we have decided to propose a more feasible alternative to treating obstructive sleep apnea through positional therapy. Positional therapy involves using a device to prevent patients from sleeping on their backs, since this position has been found to exacerbate obstructive sleep apnea. Therefore, we hypothesize that stroke patients who use the positional therapy belt will experience improvements in the severity of OSA."

NCT04507178,"Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) was long thought to be caused by subarachnoid blood-induced vasospasm. Experimental and clinical evidence suggest activation of several pathophysiological pathways, affecting the cerebral microcirculation. Recently, lower in-hospital mortality and less non-home discharge was reported in patients treated with therapeutic low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH), compared to patients with standard, prophylactic LMWH, pointing towards a potential benefit of higher doses of LMWH in the acute course after aSAH. Treatment with therapeutic LMWH might improve clinical outcome in endovascularly treated aSAH patients.

The primary objective is to evaluate whether aSAH patients treated with therapeutic LMWH have a lower 30-day mortality rate compared to patients treated with prophylactic LMWH. Secondary objectives are to evaluate whether there are significant differences between patients treated with therapeutic and prophylactic LMWH in development of DCI, (hemorrhagic) complications during admission, hydrocephalus, non-home discharge location, quality of life, clinical outcome and cognitive functioning at three and six months, total health care costs.

A single center, prospective, phase II randomized clinical trial in aneurysmal SAH patients ≥18 years old, in whom the causative aneurysm is treated with endovascular coiling less than 72 hours after initial SAH.

Patients are randomized into 2 groups: (1) Therapeutic dose LMWH group: the standard prophylactic dose, administered upon hospital admission, will be replaced by nadroparin s.c. twice daily 5700 IE anti-Xa, starting within 24 hours after coiling and continued until 21 days after ictus of initial SAH. After 21 days, patients will continue with standard care prophylactic dose until discharge or when mobilized for more than 6 hours per day; (2) Control group: standard of care treatment with prophylactic dose of LMWH; nadroparin, s.c. once daily 2850 AxaIU until discharge or when mobilized for at least 6 hours a day.

Primary outcome: 30-days' mortality. Secondary outcome: DCI, venous thrombo-embolic complications, occurrence of major and non-major bleeding, hemorrhagic complications after external ventricular/lumbar drain (EVD/ELD) placement and lumbar puncture (LP), other SAH-related complications, shunt-dependent hydrocephalus, discharge location, quality of life, total health care costs, cognitive functioning, clinical outcome."

NCT03402594,"Hypoxemia is common in acute ischemic stroke and associated with neurological deterioration and mortality. However, the benefit of oxygen therapy is controversial. Severity of stroke may affect the benefit of oxygen supplementation. Abnormal breathing patterns are commonly found among stroke patients and may increase the risk of hypoxemia. High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has several advantages from controllable fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), reduction of nasopharyngeal resistance and positive end expiratory pressure effect.

NCT03262246,"The cerebral amyloïd angiopathy ( AAC) is a disease characterized by deposits of beta-amyloid peptids in the walls of the arteries of young and average calibre of the brain and the leptomeninx. The incidence of the AAC increases strongly with the age and represents a major cause of spontaneous brain haemorrhage to people over 60. The main demonstration is the lobar brain haemorrhage, the other ones are bleedings under arachnoid cortical and microbleedings leading to cognitive decline.

Anatomical studies reported the presence of cortical infarcts in patients having amyloïd deposits suggesting an association between asymptomatic cortical cerebral infarcts and AAC.

However prevalence and meaning of these infarcts in patients having an AAC remain badly known because of studies on low number of patients and the rarity of radiological analyses of these infarcts .A better knowledge of these asymptomatic cortical infarcts would allow to dread better cognitive disorders(confusions) presented by these patients, and to develop preventive strategies.

Besides, the risk factors of severity of the AAC are little studied."
NCT03324321,"In the UK, 23,000 (15%) of the 150,000 people who suffer a stroke each year have bleeding in the brain, also referred to as acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). An Autoregulation Index (ARI) can be assigned between 0 and 9 (0 being poor and 9 being the most efficient CA observed) to gauge how good the control over blood flow is at a given time. Dynamic CA (dCA) is a measure of the response of cerebral blood flow (CBF) to rapid changes in blood pressure (BP), and several key studies have shown impaired dCA post-acute ICH. The most recent study demonstrated that dCA impairment lasts up to 12 days. This is particularly important to understand, since our preliminary work has recently shown that changes in carbon dioxide using simple breathing exercises can improve Autoregulation.

Unfortunately, there are limited non-pharmacological management options and significant opportunities to improve patient outcome in ICH. The proposed study addresses this area, by investigating whether a simple breathing exercise in survivors of ICH is safe, feasible and effective in reducing brain injury by improving cerebral autoregulation."

NCT03122626,"After a stroke, people find it difficult to perform everyday activities independently, like getting dressed, preparing meals, and shopping, limiting their independence and requiring the assistance of a family member, friend or a home care worker. Losing one's independence can decrease quality of life. Functional exercise classes run by physical therapists where people with stroke practice getting in and out of a chair, stepping, and walking, can improve the ability to balance, walk, and do everyday activities. These classes are not commonly available in community centres, mainly because fitness instructors do not receive training in how to run exercise classes for people with stroke. Therefore there is a need to make these functional exercise programs available in local community centres.

The objective of this project is to test procedures for running a large study to see whether people with stroke improve their ability to do everyday activities after participating in functional group exercise classes for 12 weeks in local community centres. If ability to do everyday activities improves, the investigators wish to see if the improvement is still present 3, 6 and 9 months later. Physical therapists at a nearby hospital will teach fitness instructors how to run the exercise class, help out during the classes, and answer questions by email or phone. Before conducting the larger Canada-wide study, it is important to determine the interest in such a program, the acceptability of the evaluations and the costs associated with the program, the degree of improvements resulting from the program, and if fitness instructors are able to run the program as planned.

In Toronto, London and Pembroke, Canada, managers at a hospital and a nearby recreation centre have agreed to help run the exercise program. A recruiter will ask people with stroke who can walk and are being discharged home from the hospital whether they can be called about the study. People with stroke and a caregiver who agree to participate in the study will complete four evaluations when they enter the study, and 3, 6, and 12 months later. At each evaluation, people with stroke will perform tests of balance and walking, and complete questionnaires about their mood, participation in valued activities, and quality of life. After the first evaluation, the investigators will use a process like flipping a coin, to see if the person with stroke will begin the exercise program immediately or 12 months later. The investigators will call people each month to ask if a fall occurred. The investigators will interview exercise participants, family members and hospital/recreation staff at the end of the study to ask about the experiences.

This project is unique because the program combines the expert knowledge and skills of physical therapists and fitness instructors. The exercise program involves practicing everyday movements, making the exercises easy for fitness instructors and people with stroke to learn. Each exercise has multiple levels of difficulty so the instructor can adapt exercises to how the person is feeling. The exercise program does not require expensive equipment (e.g. chairs, stepping stools) and therefore can be offered in most community centres. Finally, an extensive network of hospitals providing stroke care and community centres run by recreation organizations exists in Canada. Thus, if this program is beneficial, it could easily be made widely available.

With the number of Canadians living with the consequences of stroke increasing every year, access to a functional exercise programs in local community centres will improve their ability to function and live independently in the community and reduce the burden on family or caregivers and on the healthcare system."

NCT04555538,"This research study will investigate a new method for identifying which patients should be offered blood thinners or therapies to reverse the underlying causes after stroke.

Atrial fibrillation(AF) is the primary risk factor for ischaemic stroke, increasing the risk by up to 5-fold. In AF, the upper heart chambers don't pump blood effectively into the lower chambers. When this happens, a blood clot can form, dislodge and leave the heart blocking an artery in the brain and cause a stroke. However, AF is often an intermittent condition and therefore difficult to diagnose. As such, there are a group of patients in whom no cause of their stroke can be identified.

In this study, we will recruit 92 patients from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, Princess Royal University Hospital and King's College London.

As part of routine clinical care, patients undergo insertion of an Implantable Loop Recorder (CE Marked device), a minimally invasive procedure that allows accurate beat-to-beat monitoring to identify patients who develop intermittent AF post-stroke. We will request access to the data collected from this device and perform atrial MRI imaging in these patients to compare the findings between patients that do and do not have AF. If we show that atrial MRI scans are significantly different between patients with and without AF, we will use this information to support a trial of starting appropriate therapies (e.g. blood thinners) in these patients on the basis of MRI findings. This approach would have the advantage of enabling therapies to be offered to the right patients earlier and prevent repeat, potentially disabling stroke."
NCT03469206,"Background: Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) combined with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has been proven safe and effective in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) of anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO). Despite recanalization, a considerable proportion of patients do not recover. The incidence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) was similar between combined IVT plus MT and IVT, suggesting that this complication could not be attributed to the MT, but rather to pre-treatment with IVT. Meanwhile, the incidence of intracranial atherosclerosis stenosis (ICAS) is higher in Asians. It is not clear whether patients with ICAS benefit from pretreatment with alteplase or not and how ICAS modifies treatment effect.

Objective: To assess whether direct MT is non-inferior compared to combined IVT plus MT in patients with AIS due to an anterior circulation LVO, and to assess treatment effect modification by presence of ICAD.

NCT04553198,"Despite current walking rehabilitation strategies, the majority of stroke survivors are unable to walking independently in the community and remain at increased risk of falls. Backward treadmill training is a novel training approach used by elite athletes to enhance speed, agility, and balance; however, it is currently unknown how this exercise interacts with the central nervous system or if it could benefit stroke survivors with residual walking impairment. Knowledge gained from this study will likely lead to more effective walking rehabilitation strategies in stroke and related disorders."

NCT01699139,"Supine positioning was reported to increase upper airway collapsibility, apnea frequency and duration. Positional therapy, designed to minimize supine sleep, was reported to be beneficial in the general sleep apnea population. As supine sleep is very common in stroke patients, positional therapy might also have therapeutic effects. Given differences between stroke patients with sleep apnea and the general sleep apnea patient, such as rolling ability, body mass index and daytime sleepiness, positional therapy results in the general population may not be applicable to the stroke patient.

The effects of positional therapy in ischemic stroke patients with OSA have not been well-investigated. We therefore performed a pilot randomized, controlled, cross-over study to test the following hypotheses: (1) positional therapy reduces the amount of nocturnal supine positioning in patients with subacute ischemic stroke, and (2) severity of sleep apnea improves, as reflected by apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), during positional therapy. The tolerability of positional therapy over a 3-month period in patients with ischemic stroke was also evaluated."

NCT01937065,Study of heterogeneity in associations between social deprivation and the initial presentation of 12 cardiovascular diseases.
NCT01926691,"Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that even mild stroke survivors experience residual damage, which persists and in fact increases in subsequent years. About 45% of stroke victims remain with different levels of disability. While studies on cognitive impairment and dementia after stroke are receiving increasing clinical attention, the underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood. Identifying the mechanisms involved and recognizing early biomarkers for individual vulnerability, require a multi-modal approach, as the mechanisms involved in cerebrovascular disease and individual trajectories of post-stroke recovery may impact upon each other on various levels.

Aims and Hypothesis: To date there is no single measure that can be used to identify patients who are prone to develop cognitive impairment and other disabilities from those with better recovery prospects.

We hypothesize that data based on biochemical, neuroimaging, genetic and psychological measures can, in aggregate, serve as better predictors for subsequent disability, cognitive and neurological deterioration, and suggest possible interventions.

Design: The TABASCO (Tel-Aviv Brain Acute Stroke Cohort) study, a prospective cohort study aim to recruit about approximately 1125 consecutive first-ever mild-moderate stroke patients. It is designed to evaluate the association between predefined demographic, psychological, inflammatory, biochemical, neuro-imaging and genetic markers, measured during the acute phase, and long-term outcome: subsequent cognitive deterioration, vascular events (including recurrent strokes), falls, affective changes, functional everyday difficulties and mortality.

Discussion: This study is an attempt to comprehensively investigate the long term outcome of mild-moderate strokes. Its prospective design will provide quantitative data on stroke recurrence, the incidence of other vascular events and the evaluation of cognitive, affective and functional decline. Identifying the factors associated with post stroke cognitive and functional decline could potentially yield more effective therapeutic approaches.

The investigators believe that an extensive approach of analyzing the interaction between different risk factors would more accurately predict neurological and cognitive deterioration."
NCT01937910,The main goal of this research is to advance understanding of how stroke changes both the structure and function of the brain.

NCT01378780,"Stroke is a disease with tremendous individual, family, and societal impact. It is the number one cause of adult disability and third leading cause of death in the United States. Between now and the year 2050, the cost of stroke in the United States will exceed 2 trillion dollars. There is a tremendous ethnic disparity with respect to stroke in the United States. Mexican Americans are much more likely to have a stroke compared with European Americans. In Mexican Americans strokes occur at younger ages, are more likely to recur and have the same severity as they do in European Americans. Mexican Americans are the overwhelming largest sub-population of Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority group. This proposal, a scientifically-based rigorous behavioral education intervention trial, seeks to aggressively prevent stroke, especially in Mexican Americans.

Faith and family are strong components of Mexican American culture. This project works with these positive fundamental elements in order to affect stroke prevention. This project will take place in Nueces County, Texas. The project investigators have worked in this community for the past 14 years and have published extensively regarding the stroke health disparity in this stable, non-immigrant community of Mexican Americans and European Americans. We have established a strong partnership with the Catholic Diocese of Corpus Christi and assembled a team with tremendous experience at successful health behavior intervention research. Together, a proposal has been crafted that will directly speak to aggressive stroke risk factor reduction in Mexican Americans and European Americans in this representative United States community.

The significance of such research is tremendous. As the Mexican American population grows and ages, the stroke impact will be felt with greater and greater intensity. Now is the time to develop aggressive, scientifically tested interventions to limit the burden of this disease on this important segment of the United States population, and to reduce the costs of this disease to the country as a whole, in keeping with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) goal to ""identify culturally appropriate, effective stroke prevention programs for nationwide implementation in minority communities"" by FY2010."
NCT01288352,"EAST prospectively tests the hypothesis that an early, structured rhythm control therapy based on antiarrhythmic drugs and catheter ablation can prevent atrial fibrillation (AF) related complications in patients with AF when compared to usual care.

Patients will be randomized to early therapy or usual care. In the early therapy group, patients will receive either catheter ablation (usually by pulmonary vein isolation), or adequate antiarrhythmic drug therapy at an early time point. The initial therapy will be selected by the local investigator. Upon AF recurrence, both modalities will be combined.

Usual care will be conducted following the 2010European Society of Cardiology ( ESC )guidelines for AF treatment. Early rhythm control therapy will be guided by Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring."
NCT01955642,"Ischemic stroke (AIC) is the leading cause of non-traumatic disability in adults, the second leading cause of dementia and the third leading cause of death in France.

Clopidogrel is one of the recommended first line in the secondary prevention of AIC non cardioembolic origin. However recurrences occur in approximately 9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. Some studies in patients with coronary artery disease have made the connection between these treatment failures and non-biological response to clopidogrel. This non-biological response is found for approximately 30% to 50% of patients. Several mechanisms may explain this non-response. The most accepted mechanism is pharmacokinetic. Indeed, clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires intestinal absorption by P-glycoprotein (PGP) and a transformation by hepatic cytochrome into active metabolites. The genetic polymorphism of proteins involved in these two steps explain the low plasma concentration of active metabolites and thus the low efficacy of clopidogrel in some patients.

A new pharmacodynamic hypothesis suggests the involvement of platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. The activation of these receptors potentiates signaling pathway P2Y12 receptor (channel inhibited by clopidogrel) and helps reduce platelet aggregation inhibiting response to clopidogrel."
NCT03419793,"Background and objective: Upper extremity functional impairments are common consequences post stroke. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of Segmental muscle vibration (SMV) application along with supervised physical therapy (SPT) on improving activities of daily living (ADL) and motor recovery on the hemiparetic upper extremity in patients with stroke.

Methods: A sample of 37 patients post stroke (29 males) was randomly assigned to either supervised physical therapy (SPT) control group (n=18) or supervised physical therapy and segmental muscle vibration (SPT-SMV) experimental group (n=19). All patients received 3 sessions per week of SPT for 8 weeks. The SPT-SMV experimental group received SMV at the end of each SPT session.

NCT04072120,Our key objective will be to investigate if geographic proximity to first- and second-degree relatives has an influence on post-acute stroke survival and use of health and social services. We will also model and map spatial variation in stroke and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and mortality and see if some of the variation is due to spatial clustering of familial risk. The study will use innovative approaches to large-scale registry and survey data and statistical analysis on the full Norwegian population. We will integrate multigenerational and geographical information. This will enable us to assess key determinants on stroke survival and use of health and social care at municipality level.

NCT05196737,"The study team is recruiting 20 adults with spasticity due to chronic stroke for a 7 day study over 2 weeks. In people with chronic stroke, one of the most common and disabling problems is spasticity (increased muscle tone or muscle stiffness). The purpose of this research study is to examine effects of dry needling on the nervous system (pathways between the muscle, spinal cord, and brain) in people with spasticity due to chronic stroke. Dry needling is a procedure in which a thin, stainless steel needle is inserted into the skin to produce a muscle twitch response. It is intended to release a knot in the muscle and relieve pain.

The total study duration is 7 visits over 2 weeks. There will be 4 visits the first week, and 3 visits the second week. The first visit will take about 1.5 hours, during which study staff will determine the best placement of electrodes and create a cast of the participant's leg to aid them in quickly placing the electrodes on the remainder of the visits. The second and fifth visits will last about 3.5 hours, and all other visits will last about 1.5 hours. Dry needling will take place on the fifth visit only. During each visit the participant will be asked to participate in examinations of reflexes (muscle responses to non-invasive nerve stimulation) and leg function."

NCT05326724,"Stroke is the main cause of disability and the second main cause of dementia. Approximately 21.5% of patients develop dementia within 4 years after stroke. The main clinical manifestation of dementia is memory and cognitive impairment. At present, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists, were used for dementia treatment, but those drugs have limited efficacy. Exosome is an extracellular vesicle from the endosomal, size range from ~40 to 160 nm (average ~100 nm). It contains many cells including DNA, RNA, fat, and metabolites, as well as cytoplasm and cell surface proteins that play a role in regulating intercellular communication. Some studies believe that exosomes in the circulation are an ideal marker to reflect the pathological progress and recovery of stroke, and play a key role in the reorganization of tissues and the progress of neurodegeneration after stroke. Our previous studies have known that acupuncture can increase the long-term potentiation of hippocampal CA1 in rats with ischemic stroke, and improve learning-memory and neurological function. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the role of acupuncture-induced exosome in the treatment of post-stroke dementia."

NCT04903392,"Loss of motor control after stroke, muscle weakness, abnormal movement patterns, spasticity, range of motion limitations and sensory dysfunction, resulting in a decrease in the load transferred to the affected limb, changes in gait pattern and balance skills. Post-stroke muscle weakness has been shown to occur not only in the lower and upper extremity muscles but also in the respiratory muscles. It was found that the plantar pressure distribution in the affected side feet was decreased in individuals with stroke and this situation negatively affected the walking function. A systematic review of treadmill training revealed that treadmill training significantly increased walking speed and walking distance. Learning to walk backwards is also recommended to improve the movement components required for walking forward. As a result of the investigations, although there are studies about the effects of back-walking training on walking and balance function in chronic stroke patients, there is no study investigating the effects on plantar pressure distribution and respiratory parameters. Therefore, this study, which planned to investigate the effects of treadmill retching training on balance, plantar pressure distribution and respiratory parameters in chronic stroke patients, will contribute to the literature."
NCT01378000,"A clinical trial to study the effects of dosage, infusion methods and complications of unfractionated heparin (UFH) treating acute progressive cerebral infraction was conducted. In this study, we observed the effects of four UFH treatments on 480 acute progressive cerebral infraction patients during from the 6th and the 72nd hour after the attack. It was concluded that the ultra-slow continuous intravenous infusion of UFH can significantly reduce the neurological deficit score of patients with progressive cerebral infarction, increase the cure rate, decrease the recurrence rate, and improve long-term quality of daily life. It is more effective than the treatment of intravenous infusion of low- molecular- weight UFH at once a day, and the risk of bleeding may not necessarily be increased."

NCT04371055,"Patients who have suffered a stroke are having an increased risk of having recurrent stroke in the future. This risk of stroke is increased by atrial fibrillation, which often ""comes and goes"" (called paroxysmal) and hence escapes routine diagnostics. The hypothesis of Find-AF 2 is that enhanced (evaluation in a ECG core lab), prolonged (at least 7 days of rhythm monitoring annually) and intensified (continuous rhythm monitoring in high risk patients) not only finds atrial fibrillation more often, but that changes in therapeutic management (e. g. start of anticoagulation after detection of atrial fibrillation) results in a decrease of cardioembolism (which can be either recurrent stroke or systemic embolism).

To prove this hypothesis, patients will be randomised into two groups: the first group will receive the currently available standard care for patients with stroke. In the second group, cardiac rhythm monitoring adapted to the risk of the occurrence of atrial fibrillation is performed - either with a 7-day long-term ECG (at baseline, after 3 and 12 months and every 12 months thereafter) or with continuous monitoring using an implantable cardiac monitor. If atrial fibrillation is detected, this information will be given to the treating study physician. Any therapeutic decision is at the discretion of the treating physician, but should follow current guidelines."

NCT01661322,"The risk of recurrence is greatest immediately after stroke or Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA). Existing prevention strategies (antithrombotic, lipid/blood pressure lowering, endarterectomy) reduce, not abolish, further events. Dual antiplatelet therapy - aspirin & clopidogrel (AC) for IHD, aspirin & dipyridamole (AD) for stroke, is superior to aspirin monotherapy. The investigators hypothesise that triple antiplatelet therapy (ACD) will be superior to AD in patients at high-risk of recurrence, providing bleeding does not become excessive.

Design: TARDIS is a multicentre, parallel-group, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint, controlled trial. In the start-up phase, the investigators will assess over 3 years the safety, tolerability and feasibility of intensive therapy (ACD) versus guideline therapy (AD) given for 1 month in 750 patients with acute stroke/TIA. The main phase will then assess the safety and efficacy of ACD in up to 3500 patients. The primary outcome is ordinal stroke (fatal/severe non-fatal/mild/TIA/none) at 90 days.

NCT03709329,"Restoration of gait independence in stroke patients is one of the most important goals of rehabilitation therapy, and gait rehabilitation is one of the most important treatments in the treatment of stroke because it is a major factor affecting rehabilitation after stroke. In the rehabilitation of patients with post - stroke walking disorders, previous physical therapy was mainly manual therapy using therapist 's physical effort and walking training with walking aids. In recent years, however, emphasis has been placed on therapies based on motor learning concepts, which allow the patient to intensively train the exercise as closely as possible to the ultimate goal.

The robot used for walking rehabilitation includes exoskeleton walking robot such as Lokomat® (Hocoma AG, Switzerland), Walkbot-G® (P & S Mechanics, Korea), MorningWalk® (Curexo, Korea) According to the Systematic Review, which compares two types of robot-assisted gait treatment divided into end-effector type, which is not an exoskeletal type such as System® (Rehatech, Switzerland) It has been reported that the percentage of patients who were able to walk independently when treated with a robot was higher than that of an exoskeleton-type robot.

In this regard, in terms of acquisition of independent gait, studies on the therapeutic effect of the exoskeleton-type robot and the end-effector-type robot before and after the gait therapy were continuously performed, but 80% of the patients obtained independent gait, Despite the fact that many of these patients have abnormal walking, research has not yet been conducted. In previous studies, there was a statistically significant improvement in parameters of Gait speed, Cadence, and step length when compared with spatiotemporal parameters in training using exoskeleton robots for stroke patients. In another study, Gait speed and Cadence did not show a statistically significant improvement, and the effect on Gait speed and Cadence is still unknown. However, unlike exoskeletal robots, end-effector robotic gait training has been reported to improve Gait speed in most studies compared to conventional gait training. In addition, Cadence, Temporal symmetry ratio, Single, an improved side stride length, an improvement in the symmetry index of stance phase, and an improvement in Gait endurance.

In this way, the end effector type robot walking training is more likely to improve walking quality than the exoskeleton type robot. The end-effector type robot, which is different from the exoskeleton type, reproduces the gait using the ankle joint to induce the movement of the knee joint and the hip joint. Therefore, it is possible to control the ankle joint, which is essential for improving the gait pattern. It is considered that the end effector type robot which can control the ankle joint is more likely to induce the improvement of the gait pattern than the existing exoskeleton type robot because it shows limitations in reproducing the ankle rocker motion."

This group of patients is at high risk for having a recurrent stroke or TIA, and the investigators would like to investigate new ways of preventing potentially avoidable events. The treatment of sleep disorders immediately after a stroke or TIA may prove to be a novel method of avoiding future strokes and improving outcomes."
NCT03649217,"The objective of this research is to test a passive shoe to correct gait in individuals with asymmetric walking patterns. This will be done in a clinic and within their own home. Individuals with central nervous system damage, such as stroke, often have irregular walking patterns and have difficulty walking correctly. Recent research has shown that using a split-belt treadmill can create after-effects that temporarily correct the inefficient walking patterns. However, the corrected walking pattern does not efficiently transfer from the treadmill to walking over ground. The iStride, formerly known as the Gait Enhancing Mobile Shoe (GEMS), may allow a patient to practice walking in many different locations, such as their own home, which we hypothesize will result in a more permanent transfer of learned gait patterns. To enable long-term use, our proposed shoe design is passive and uses the wearer's natural forces exerted while walking to generate the necessary motions."
NCT04947293,"Stroke is a major health problem and can cause long-term disability. Among these sequelae, there are balance and mobility disorders, but also a higher rate of anxiety or depression disorders. This impairments impact activity of daily living, and social reintegration. That why the investigators need to explore options for long-term sustainable interventions that which takes into account the patient as a whole. In particular, regular physical activity is recommended, but it must be adaptable to the patient's impairments. Teaching yoga may be an interesting option. Indeed, yoga is a mind-body practice which become increasingly widespread in the world. Recent studies highlight positive effect of yoga for this population. However, the levels of evidence are limited, and new studies are needed.

NCT03699397,"Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is the standard treatment for patients with a large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke. Direct presentation of patients with an LVO to a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) reduces onset-to-treatment time by approximately an hour and thereby improves clinical outcome. However, a reliable tool for prehospital LVO-detection is currently not available. Previous electroencephalography (EEG) studies have shown that hemispheric hypoxia quickly results in slowing of the EEG-signal. Dry electrode EEG caps allow reliable EEG measurement in less than five minutes. We hypothesize that dry electrode EEG is an accurate and feasible diagnostic test for LVO in the prehospital setting.

ELECTRA-STROKE is a diagnostic pilot study that consists of four phases. In phases 1, 2 and 3, technical and logistical feasibility of performing dry electrode EEGs are tested in different in-hospital settings: the outpatient clinic (sample size: max. 20 patients), Neurology ward (sample size: max. 20 patients) and emergency room (sample size: max. 300 patients), respectively. In the final phase, ambulance paramedics will perform dry electrode EEGs in 386 patients with a suspected stroke. The aim of the ELECTRA-STROKE study is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of dry-electrode EEG for diagnosis of LVO-a stroke when performed by ambulance personnel in patients with a suspected AIS. Sample size calculation is based on an expected specificity of 70% and an incidence of LVO stroke of 5%."

NCT01988220,"Background: It is estimated that 50%-85% of individuals post stroke demonstrate sensory deficits. Sensory impairments are often overlooked in the therapeutic setting, although they lead to slower motor recovery.

Working hypothesis: The overall goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a sensory discrimination reeducation oriented therapeutic program to the lower limb of stroke patients with sensory impairments. We assume that subjects to both groups will make progress, which will be more significant in the experimental group.

Methods: Study population and design: Sixty individuals with chronic sensory impairment following a stroke will be recruited. Patients will be randomly assigned to sensory retraining treatment or to sensory stimulation treatment. Treatment will consist of ten 45 minute long intervention sessions, carried out within a 6 weeks period, and a home exercise program. The person conducting the assessments will be blind to the treatment allocation of the subjects. Outcome measures: The efficacy of the intervention will be determined in relation to the International Classification of Functionality (ICF) developed by the World Health Organization and will include assessments at the three domains defined by this model: 1. Body structure and function - determined by measures of the sensory capacity of the lower more affected limb; 2. Activities - determined by measures of balance and gait; 3. Participation - determined by measures of well-being and social reintegration.

Two new outcome measures, for ankle and knee position sense and for texture discrimination of the foot, will be developed within this study. Data reliability measures on healthy population, and test - retest measures in post stroke population with be collected.

Intervention: The experimental group will be treated by a perception learning oriented protocol for sensory reeducation, to improve identification, localization and discrimination of sensory stimuli, including electrical stimulation, texture and hardness discrimination and position sense training. The control group will receive the same stimuli without the attentive learning and discriminating component.

Importance: Scientific proof and focused recommendations for a potent therapeutic method for the post-stroke population, allowing them better participation and quality of life.

NCT02031107,"Background: Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability. Non-invasive brain stimulation can induce significant and sustained improvements in functional outcome. However the effect is inconsistent and difficult to predict, in particular in the subacute phase after stroke. Although several different stimulation techniques are available, it is unknown which is suitable for which patient.

Objectives: This study has three main objectives:

To compare the effects of two techniques of non-invasive brain stimulation (cTBC, continuous theta-burst stimulation; tDCS, direct current transcranial stimulation) on clinical recovery in patients with subacute stroke.
To assess the effect of these brain stimulation techniques on brain organization with non-invasive imaging.
To find clinical and neural predictors of responsiveness to brain stimulation therapy.

Method: 45 patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke will be randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: cTBS, tDCS, or sham stimulation. Each group will receive the corresponding stimulation therapy 3 times per week for 3 weeks, immediately before intensive physical therapy. Before and after the treatment period, standardized assessments of sensorimotor function areas are obtained together with electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance recordings. These recordings will be used to analyze and compare the neural effects of each treatment modality.

Clinical Implication: The results of this study might help optimize and individualize stimulation treatment for patients with subacute stroke. It may hence facilitate the transfer of brain stimulation therapy to routine clinical practice."

A Cochrane Review systematically synthesized and compared the effects of aquatic and land-based therapies on the activities of daily living (ADL) of patients following stroke and found that water-based exercises improved strength and ADL. A recent review indicates that RCTs comparing aquatic methods in both environments are lacking. The same movements in water and on dry land that target postural stability and gait require different competences. For example, the postural instability that occurs while squatting in water was enacted on land by sitting on a therapy ball. Furthermore, land-based conventional rehabilitation is generally task oriented, customized and challenging and follows a specific preparatory sequence of exercises according to patients' disabilities. Therefore, the investigators believe that a sequential preparatory approach (SPA), based on increasing difficulty and following a specific sequence of preparatory exercises (from the simplest to the most complex), should also be used in an aquatic environment."

NCT04359589,"Background: Acute ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are a kind of diseases with high incidence, rapid progression, poor prognosis and high mortality and disability rate of the circulatory system, mainly including acute myocardial infarction, acute ischemic stroke and acute limb ischemia, which place a heavy burden on individuals, families and society due to their severe prognosis and high medical costs. At present, the diagnosis and treatment of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases mainly focus on single organ diagnosis and treatment of target organs, lacking of indicators to comprehensively evaluate the body's pathophysiology. As ischemic disease of the circulatory system, ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases have common pathophysiological basis such as ischemia, hypoxia and inflammation. These common pathophysiological basis suggests that different acute ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases can be monitored and evaluated from an integrated perspective, it suggests the possibility of comprehensive diagnosis, evaluation and treatment guidance. At present, the ""circulatory integration"" therapy represented by the combined treatment of heart and brain has achieved certain results, but there is no corresponding evaluation system to provide accurate guidance. Therefore, with the concept of ""circulation integration"", it is an urgent problem to find the common indicators of the circulation system and construct the hierarchical diagnosis and subsequent evaluation system of acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular integration. The development of efficient and comprehensive stratified diagnosis and prognosis evaluation system is of great significance in clinical, market and social aspects.

At the early stage of the efforts our team, it was found that Dan Shen Su-(±)-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DSS) could be detected in the plasma and urine of patients with acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke through metabolomics. It has been proved that it can be generated by the transformation of dihydroxyphenylalanine by proteus mirabilis, and its structure is consistent with the water-soluble component of salvia miltiorrhiza, which is related to the body's states of ischemia, hypoxia and inflammation. The findings provide a material basis for the ""circulatory integration"" assessment of acute ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.

Objectives: This study aims at acute ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, with the concept of ""circulatory integration"", to build a hierarchical diagnosis and prognosis evaluation system with DSS as the core, in order to improve the diagnosis rate and cure rate, improve the prognosis and reduce mortality of ischemic cardiovascular diseases.

Methods: The project included 500 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 300 patients with acute ischemic stroke, 300 patients with acute lower limb ischemia, and 200 healthy controls in the Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, Peoples R China. Plasma and urine were collected during the disease process. Various relevant clinical indicators including DSS level were included, COX model was applied to analyze the influence of multiple factors on the prognosis of the above diseases, and the indicators were screened and the integrated stratified diagnosis and prognosis evaluation system of acute ischemic cardio-cerebrovascular system with DSS as the core were established. The newly established integrated stratified diagnosis and prognosis assessment system was used to evaluate 200 patients with each of the three diseases, and the sensitivity and specificity of the new assessment system were tested. And a simple, rapid and accurate method for detecting DSS was developed."

NCT04295044,"Our prior studies demonstrated that dehydration was a predictor for poor outcome in stroke and Blood urea nitrogen/Cr ratio-based saline hydration therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke may increase the rate of favorable clinical outcome with functional independence at 3 months after stroke. However, dehydration is likely to be only a part of representation in poor nutrition status and physical fragility for a stroke patient.

Our prior study found that acute stroke patients admitted to neurological intensive care unit with low urinary creatinine excretion rate (CER), a marker of muscle mass, was associated with poor outcome at 6 months after stroke. An animal study suggested inadequate food and water intake determine mortality following stroke in mice and nutritional support reduced the 14-day mortality rate from 59% to 15%. A study also showed that high protein intake was associated with a better outcome in previous cardiovascular events.

NCT03611855,"The purpose of this research study is to show that a computer can analyze brain waves and that those brain waves can be used to control an external device. This study will also show whether passive movement of the affected hand as a result of brain-based control can cause rehabilitation from the effects of a stroke. Additionally, this study will show how rehabilitation with a brain-controlled device may affect the function and organization of the brain.

Stroke is the most common neurological disorder in the US with 795,000 strokes per year (Lloyd-Jones et al. 2009). Of survivors, 15-30% are permanently disabled and 20% require institutional care (Mackay et al. 2004; Lloyd-Jones et al. 2009). In survivors over age 65, 50% had hemiparesis, 30% were unable to walk without assistance, and 26% received institutional care six months post stroke (Lloyd-Jones et al. 2009). These deficits are significant, as recovery is completed after three months (Duncan et al. 1992; Jorgensen et al. 1995). This large patient population with decreased quality of life fuels the need to develop novel methods for improving functional rehabilitation. We propose that signals from the unaffected hemisphere can be used to develop a novel Brain-Computer interface (BCI) system that can facilitate functional improvement or recovery. This can be accomplished by using signals recorded from the brain as a control signal for a robotic hand orthotic to improve motor function, or by strengthening functional pathways through neural plasticity. Neural activity from the unaffected hemisphere to the affected hemiparetic limb would provide a BCI control in stroke survivors lesions that prevent perilesional mechanisms of motor recovery. The development of BCI systems for functional recovery in the affected limb in stroke survivors will be significant because they will provide a path for improving quality of life for chronic stroke survivors who would otherwise have permanent loss of function. Initially, the study will serve to determine the feasibility of using EEG signals from the non-lesioned hemisphere to control a robotic hand orthotic. The study will then determine if a brain-computer interface system can be used to impact rehabilitation, and how it may impact brain function. The system consists of a research approved EEG headset, the robotic hand orthotic, and a commercial tablet. The orthotic will be made, configured, and maintained by Neurolutions. Each participant will complete as many training sessions as the participant requires, during which a visual cue will be shown to the participant to vividly imagine moving their impaired upper extremity to control the opening and closing of the orthotic. Participants may also be asked to complete brain scans using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)."

NCT05313776,"Why: Upper-limb recovery post-stroke is challenging. Rehabilitation, aiming to induce plasticity takes an important place in patients' treatment. The last years, non-invasive brain stimulation of the primary motor cortex has gained the communities' interest, allowing direct modification of neural excitability and thus impacting plasticity. Yet, research outcomes remain inconclusive to date. It's expected this to be related to patient heterogeneity including mild to severe motor deficits, and suboptimal site of stimulation. It might be questioned whether M1 stimulation is preferable over that of higher association areas like the parietal or premotor cortex.

What: The aim of the study is to identify alternative brain regions to stimulate, related to improved motor quality after a severe initial deficit. How: by following motor recovery over time, by co-recording movement kinematics and brain activity.

Because: Stimulation of the novel identified regions may improve motor recovery after stroke."
NCT01883843,"Stroke is one of the major causes of disability in the Western world. Initially gait is the most affected function, 80% of patients lose this ability.

Rehabilitation in stroke patients improves walking abilities in terms of gait and related gait activities, though six months after stroke many patients are significantly disabled.

Recently, a prospective study of 205 stroke patients showed that approximately 21% of patients have a significant decrease of mobility between the first and the third year after stroke. The main finding showed that inactivity was the most important factor for the mobility decline.

Evidence about effects of direct current brain stimulation on motor recovery function of lower limb are still little, some show that quadriceps strength after stimulation of damaged M1 area increased. Another study where tDCS was associated with robotic gait training did not report any effect compared to treatment alone. It is necessary to define if a different dosage of stimulation or the association of tDCS with gait training can improve walking and if further studies are required to investigate their effectiveness.

The aim of this clinical trial is to test the possibility of gait improvement through the association of tDCS with a specific task-oriented circuit training for walking abilities, balance and mobility."
NCT04848285,"The primary goal of most acute stroke interventions is to restore cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the affected region and prevent hypoperfusion during early clinical course. Diffuse optical technology offers a new opportunity for invasive, real time and bedside assessment of brain function biomarkers, including CBF. However, whether CBF monitoring can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from therapies is unclear Recently, it was suggested that the benefit of early mobilization (EM) after stroke on motor recovery may be outweighed by a deleterious effect on cerebral perfusion if cerebral autoregulation (CA) is impaired. Hypothetically, EM could improve recovery outcomes after stroke in selected patients based on CA function. Our objective is to investigate if EM leads to superior motor and functional outcome after stroke compared to standard care (SC) in selected patients based on optical biomarkers of CA and evaluate the feasibility of the clinical use of a novel transcranial optical monitoring system adapted to deliver biomarkers of CA at the bedside. The investigators designed a randomized controlled, open-labeled trial with blinded assessment of outcome end-points in a stroke unit of a tertiary stroke center. Patients with an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke will be recruited and randomly assigned within 24 hours after symptoms onset to receive SC alone or EM in addition to SC. All patients will undergo optical monitoring of CA on admission to the Stroke Unit during the first mobilization. Randomization will be stratified by stroke severity and type of stroke.

NCT04834362,"Introduction: Glycemic control in acutely ill stroke patients with hyperglycemia is vital. Although insulin is the choice of anti-diabetic agent during acute stage, it is not clear which insulin regimen is better in terms of glycemic control and prevention of hypoglycemia in hospitalized acute stroke patients who are usually on small frequent nasogastric tube feeding. The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of human insulin (regular insulin and neutral protamine hagedorn, NPH insulin) to analog insulin (basal insulin glargine and rapid acting insulin aspart) in hospitalized acute stroke patients with hyperglycemia.

Justification: Analog insulins are developed by minor alteration of the amino acid chain which alters their pharmacokinetics and make them more physiological. However, these insulins are costly and are not widely available. Conventional human insulins are more commonly used in our country. Comparison of these two regimen is necessary in our own setting to optimize optimal glycemic management of hospitalized acute stroke patients.

Methodology: In this single-center, open-label, randomized trial, 100 patients with acute stroke and hyperglycemia (capillary blood glucose ≥10 mmol/L on 2 or more occasions) or history of type 2 DM admitted in the in-patient Department of Neurology, National Institute of Neurosciences (NINS) & Hospital will be randomly assigned to receive human insulin or modern insulin therapy in 1:1 ratio. The study will be carried out from February to June 2021. Blood glucose (BG) will be monitored by standardized glucometer thrice a day and insulin dose will be adjusted daily. The primary outcome of the study will be the differences in glycemic control between groups, as measured by mean daily BG concentration during the hospital stay. Secondary outcomes include differences between treatment groups in any of the following measures: number of hypoglycemic events (BG <3.9 mmol/L), total daily dose of insulin, length of hospital stay, hospital complications and mortality."
NCT05081570,"Introduction: The progress of stroke recovery is slow and enduring. If stroke survivors are not properly managed to facilitate their rehabilitation after discharged from hospital, their risk for recurrence after an index stroke will be very high. Globally, nurse-led post-acute stroke clinics have been developed to provide tertiary care services to support stroke survivors. While synthesized evidence supports the idea that the post-stroke services delivered by nurses in the clinic can improve the functional ability and reduce the readmission rate, shortcomings of these services such as compulsory traveling time and cost, long waiting time at the clinic, and the pandemic situation limit the clinic utilization by stroke survivors. Telecare consultation is a new modality aiming to provide a new healthcare access experience to the public, though how it can be applied in nurse-led clinic and what effects it can bring about on post-stroke survivors has not been reported."

NCT05228080,"Stroke is the second largest cause of death globally after ischemic heart disease.Of the total number of prevalent strokes, 84.4% are ischemic. Reperfusion therapy is the most important treatment for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) ,including intravenous thrombolysis and/or endovascular treatment.However,the most serious and common complication with reperfusion therapy is hemorrhage transformation(HT),which significantly increases disability and mortality. The fundamental mechanism leading to post-stroke HT is the disruption of the blood brain barrier(BBB) and increase of permeability.Endocan plays a critical role in vascular inflammatory responses by enhances the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by endothelial cells,the expression of adhesion molecules such as inter-cellular adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1(VCAM-1),and the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells. Endocan significantly decreases levels of zonula occludens（ZO-1) and occludin which are tight junction proteins that play major roles in the maintenance of vascular barriers. Endocan could induce vascular endothelial growth factor-A(VEGF-A) and facilitate the binding of VEGF-A to its receptor(VEGFR-2) to enhanced endothelial permeability.Therefore,endocan is a reliable biomarker of endothelial dysfunction, which may be associated with disruption of the BBB. In this context, the investigators hypothesized that elevated pretreatment serum endocan levels might be independently associated with HT after reperfusion therapy in the acute phase of ischemic stroke. Serum endocan,ICAM-1,VCAM-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9(MMP-9) levels will be determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) in blood samples obtained at baseline (pretreatment) and at 12,24 hours after reperfusion therapy in patients with acute stroke and in healthy subjects.In the present study,the investigators attempt to investigate whether high levels of endocan are associated with HT in patients who received reperfusion therapy.In addition,the investigators explore the association between serum endocan and early neurological deterioration and unfavourable short-term prognosis."

NCT02737189,"Endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke has shown strong benefit in several prospective randomized trials in the anterior circulation and endovascular therapy for basilar artery occlusion has shown promising results in several single-arm studies. This has led to a broad adoption of these techniques which are now considered standard of care in many institutions despite the lack of adequate evidence to prove their benefit. Indeed, the rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage in these studies have consistently been around 5% which raises the question as to whether patients could actually be harmed as opposed to helped by these procedures. This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled, open, blinded-endpoint trial, with the aim to evaluate the hypothesis that mechanical embolectomy with the Solitaire device is superior to medical management alone in achieving better outcomes in subjects presenting with an acute ischemic stroke caused by occlusion of the basilar artery within 6-24 hours from symptom onset."

Among them, upper limb function is often strongly impaired. In this study the investigators are interested in the eventuality to improve motor recovery by the mean of stimulating the proprioception.

Proprioception can be stimulated by tendinous vibrations in order to act on the neuromuscular system through the vibratory tonic reflex and by movement illusion.

Stimulation by tendinous vibrations, applied to the musculotendinous endings, has been already proposed in post stroke rehabilitation, but only at late stages. Thus the aim of our study is to observe the effects of repeated tendon vibrations, applied in the early post stroke phase, the effect being measured on the excitability of the motor cortex by the Motor Evoked Potentials and on the motor recovery (motor control and activities)."
NCT04483141,"Pain is common after a stroke, affecting up to 49% of patients within 2 years of the event. They include headache, musculoskeletal pain, spasticity and central neuropathic pain. A wide range of patients have communication problems after stroke that make it difficult to assess pain. Yet there is a major impact of pain on the quality of life of these patients. Some tools have been validated to assess pain in non-communicative patients, but none are specific to stroke patients. The Algoplus scale is commonly used in intra-hospital care in France. The Abbey Pain Scale is not translated into French, and could provide a more accurate pain rating for non-communicative patients.

The objective is to validate a French version of the Abbey Pain Scale for stroke patients.

NCT04437251,"Participants are being asked to participate in a research study conducted by Shih-Chiao Tseng, PT, Ph.D. at Texas Woman's University. This research study is to determine whether low-intensive brain stimulation can enhance learning of a leg movement task. The investigators also want to know if brain stimulation can improve the nerve function and walking performance. Our goal is to understand any relationship between brain stimulation and overall movement control improvement. Participants have been invited to join this research if they have had a stroke before or they are healthy adults aged 21 years or older. Research evidence shows stroke can induce permanent brain damage and therefore may cause a person to have trouble learning a new task. This in turn may significantly impact the recovery of motor function in stroke survivors. In addition, the investigators also want to know how a healthy person learns this new leg task and see if her/his learning pattern differs from a stroke survivor.

This study comprises two phases: Phase I study investigates short-term effects of brain stimulation on leg skill learning and only requires two visits to TWU. The total time commitment for Phase I study will be about 6.5 hours, 3.5 hours on the first visit and three hours on the second visit; Phase II study is an expanded version of Phase I study to investigate long-term effects of brain stimulation on leg skill learning and requires to complete 12 visits of exercise training paired with brain stimulation over a four-week period and additional one visit for follow-up test. The total time commitment for Phase II study will be about 20 hours, a total of 18 hours for 12 exercise training sessions and two hours for a follow-up test. The investigators hypothesize that people with chronic stroke will show a slower rate of acquiring this leg skill as compared to healthy adults. The investigators also hypothesize that co-applying brain stimulation with 12 sessions of exercise training will enhance skill learning of this leg task for people with chronic stroke and this 12-session exercise program may exert beneficial influences on the nerve function and leg muscle activation, and consequentially improve motor control for walking."

Neurorehabilitation is an important treatment option for stroke patients with anatomical and functional impairments in their interhemispheric connections. However, special techniques with high effectiveness are being investigated to increase the success of general rehabilitation. In this context, scapula-focused stabilization techniques have been used in stroke patients recently.

NCT03561285,"The burden of stroke is increasing in many low- and middle income countries.(1) Around 10% of all thrombotic cerebrovascular events (CVE) occur in young population defined as younger than 50 years old (2)

In the majority of these patients, the cause of the ischaemic stroke remains undetermined.(3) Arterial thrombosis is a major clinical manifestation of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), an autoimmune condition characterised by thrombotic events and/or pregnancy morbidity with persistently positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) (4).

Considering all patients with cerebral ischaemia, the prevalence of aPL seems rather high in young adults, who might constitute a subgroup at high risk for recurrence.(5)

Through the support of the Antiphospholipid Syndrome Alliance for Clinical Trials and International Networking (APS ACTION), a systematic review aiming to estimate the frequency of clinically significant aPL profiles in the general population (no age limit) was completed. (6)

The pathogenesis of ischemic stroke is complex, and several studies documented hypercoagulable states as a significant mechanism underlying stroke. (8).

The latter include protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III deficiencies, activated protein C resistance and anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPLA), including anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies or lupus anticoagulant (LAC), which influence stroke susceptibility owing to their capacity to disturb normal hemostatic mechanisms (9).

While aPLA are clinically associated with a state of hypercoagulation and prothrombotic disorders, the exact mechanism underlying their prothrombotic effects remains unknown (10).

aPLA are detected either functionally, owing to their ability to prolong coagulation time in a phospholipid-dependent coagulation test (LAC), or by measuring specific [anticardiolipin (aCL) and antiphosphatidylserine (aPS)] antibodies by specific immunoassays, using anionic phospholipids as antigens (11).

The contribution of LAC to the overall risk of both venous and arterial thrombosis, including ischemic stroke, is now well recognized (12).

While the contribution of aPLA (including LAC and aCL antibodies) to thrombosis is well established, their role as independent risk factors in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke yielded apparently conflicting results. (13).

These conflicting results could be explained by differences in ethnic origin , inherent variation in aPLA levels and in the failure in some studies to account for the contribution of covariates (14).

Osteopontin (OPN) was first identified as a protein involved in bone remodelling, but later also shown to have important immunological roles. (15)."

NCT02811913,"Stroke affects over 795,000 Americans every year and has an enormous impact on the well-being of American Veterans with 6,000 new stroke admissions every year. Many of these stroke survivors are living with disabilities that limit their everyday function. One of the major consequences of stroke is loss of sensation which manifests as inability to perceive touch, temperature, pain or limb movement. Lack of sensation hinders full functional recovery. Current treatments for sensory loss produce only limited improvements and do not achieve full recovery. Therefore, it is critical to develop new therapies to re-train sensory function. The investigators propose to evaluate a novel non-invasive brain stimulation treatment called repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). The effects of this technique on motor deficits following stroke have been studied, however rTMS for the treatment of sensory loss has not been examined to date. The investigators' study will examine for the first time if rTMS of a sensory brain region can improve sensory function in chronic stroke survivors."

NCT01312623,"Cardiac surgery is associated with risk of perioperative inflammation and ischemia leading to cerebral and myocardial morbidity and mortality. Ischemic preconditioning by repetitive ischemic episodes at an organ can reduce damage resulting from consecutive prolonged ischemia in that organ. Remote ischemic preconditioning is defined as ischemic preconditioning by repetitive ischemic episodes of an organ remote from the organ to be protected, e.g. ischemic episodes of a limb can reduce ischemic damage of the heart. Animal studies as well as human studies have shown that ischemic preconditioning can protect the heart from intraoperative ischemia. Remote preconditioning by repetitive limb ischemia has been applied in humans in some studies.12-14 However, the published data is not yet sufficient to support evidence based recommendations for clinical practice. In particular, available data regarding the influence of remote preconditioning on inflammatory and ischemic damage of brain and heart in children following surgery of congenital heart disease are limited. Hence, this prospective, controlled and randomized study was designed to perform remote ischemic preconditioning in children after induction of anesthesia for pediatric heart surgery and to investigate the effect on postoperative organ function in comparison to a control group."
NCT01311414,"During clamping of one internal carotid artery for endarterectomy, blood flow through this vessel has to be compensated by collateral arteries including the contralateral internal artery and vertebral arteries. In 7 % of all patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy this collateral flow is not sufficient to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion during clamping and ischemic brain damage is likely to emerge. To maximize cerebral blood flow during clamping, increase of blood pressure is a common procedure and routine at our institution. Increasing blood pressure can be enabled by tapering a mixture of Cafedrine und Theodrenalin (Akrinor®) until the designated blood pressure is reached. After declamping, the blood pressure has to be reduced to normal values to avoid postoperative hyperperfusion syndrome. This is enabled by tapering urapidil until normal blood pressure is achieved.

It has been shown that cerebral oxygenation measured by near infrared spectroscopy is reduced by intravenous application of norepinephrine. Otherwise, intravenous nitroglycerine increases cerebral oxygenation during cardiopulmonary bypass. Hence, cafedrine/theodrenalin and urapidil may also have an effect on cerebral perfusion. In this prospective randomized study the effect of cafedrine/theodrenalin and urapidil on cerebral oxygenation measured by near infrared spectroscopy is investigated."

NCT01322997,"Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States. One of the reasons that it is so disabling is because of upper extremity hemiparesis (weakness in one arm), which is commonly seen after stroke.

The objective of this research is to see if a robotic system worn on the weakened arm like a brace is more useful in improving the strength and coordination of the affected arm, and those of other stroke survivors, than therapy only. Muscle weakness and lack of coordination after a stroke have great effects on how severely disabled the arm is and on quality of life after a stroke.

In this study, patients may be administered a new robotic brace as part of treatment for their affected arms. If they use this brace, your electromyography (EMG) signals will be used to control the powered arm brace. EMG signals are the small electrical signals that result from the actions of the muscles. The system will ""listen"" to patients' muscles, using small sensors that sit on top of the skin. The device will give the arm a ""power-assist"" when patients bend or straighten their elbows. The investigators want to test how easy and effective this system is to use. The investigators hypothesize that people using the robot will be more successful in their rehabilitative efforts - and that their movement will improve more - than people receiving traditional therapy."

Computer tomography (CT) examination was done at first day, 4th day and 7th day of admission, respectively. The ratio of brain edema was calculated by CT image, and inflammatory index including the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)，Creatine Kinase BB Isoenzyme (CMBB). D-dimer from venous blood also were measured. In addition, the score including Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), Modified rankin scale (MRS), Function independence measure (FIM), Barthel index (BI) was recorded one week, four weeks and 12 weeks after admission or surgical operation, as an index for clinical symptoms. The index for the therapeutic effect of AM was according to above-mentioned the ratio of brain edema, inflammatory index and clinical symptoms.

The investigators expected the results of the present study may provide a scientific evidence for the hemorrhagic stroke edema treatment of AM, thus, the present study may contribute to use the method of integrated Chinese and Western Medicine for the treatment of stroke, and to the research of Chinese Medicine."
NCT01339130,"Empathy, defined as the ability to understand others emotions, is a fundamental concept in social interactions. It is a psychological phenomenon involving various separable components : (i) the ability to feel and imagine the emotions, (ii) the ability to adopt the perspective of other people. Several neurological diseases with behavioral disorders may lead to impaired processing of social and/or emotional informations. These pathologies are likely to induce a lack of empathy that may result from impairments at different levels.

The objective is simply to study how others' emotions are understood and how this allows for regulation of personal behavior. This study is being carried out among patients seen for various health problems and who can make behavior changes. This study could help to understand some neurological diseases and thereby to identify them earlier and/or to better differentiate them."

NCT01325545,"About one-third of patients with stroke have no documented cause for the cerebrovascular event (known as cryptogenic strokes). Atrial fibrillation is a common cause of stroke, but when transient (paroxysmal) it may remain undiagnosed. Recent data suggest that occult paroxysmal atrial fibrillation may be identified in patients with cryptogenic strokes using prolonged ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitors.

The investigators designed this study pursuing the following goals:

To determine the prevalence of occult paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with cryptogenic stroke using long-term mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry.
To compare this prevalence to that found in a control group with stroke of known, non-cardioembolic cause.
To look for clinical, laboratory, echocardiographic, and imaging data that serve as risk factors for occult paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with cryptogenic stroke.
To examine the utility of mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry, a relatively new diagnostic tool, in the evaluation of patients with cryptogenic stroke."

NCT04741451,"Stroke is the most common cause of non-traumatic disability in adults and ranks second among causes of dementia and third among causes of death. In France, stroke affects around 140,000 patients each year and entails enormous economic costs. Given the average age of onset of stroke, its prevalence is expected to increase with increasing life expectancy and the advancing age of the population.

Clinically, depending on the region of the brain affected, stroke results in a sudden and abrupt onset of sensorimotor, cognitive, emotional and / or behavioral manifestations, associated with variable recovery from patient to patient. Stroke has psychological, social and family consequences. Indeed, its occurrence could affect patients on a physical and psychological level (direct physical and cognitive sequelae of stroke, decrease or even absence of autonomy and dependence of the entourage, associated psychological changes) and generate repercussions on the dynamics. family or that of the couple (ie, changes in activities, redistribution of tasks, changes or even inversion of roles, alteration of the intimate sphere), as well as professional and social life. This could hamper the quality of life of patients and their loved ones and cause collateral damage to their social or family environment.

After discharge from the hospital, the patient's relatives will play a major role in taking charge of home care (e.g. household activities and personal care around hygiene, food, mobility and administration. treatments) as well as in the community (eg purchase of clothes or food, accompaniment to medical visits), although these helpers do not have the professional knowledge and skills in care. Despite the positive effects that caregivers can have in connection with the care they provide (ie, feeling of accomplishment and usefulness, development of a sense linked to this helping role, better self-esteem, improvement of personal skills), their continued investment in their sick relatives could deprive them of their resources, making them ""hidden or invisible patients / victims"". In addition, the gap between caregiver capacities to provide care and the health needs of patients could result in caregiver burden (i.e., caregiving burden). Caregivers of stroke patients experience an impaired quality of life, neglect of their own health, reduced work and leisure activities, as well as psychological suffering involving feelings of abandonment, loneliness and helplessness. uncertainty. In the context of a stroke, caregivers may be overwhelmed by the emotions of their ill loved ones as well as their own emotions. Emotional regulation is essential in such a context rich in emotional experience; it is the set of strategies that enables individuals to influence the emotions they feel, when they appear, and how they experience and express them.

Reviews of the literature have highlighted the lack of studies addressing the burden on caregivers and the need for research to identify those at risk and implement appropriate interventions.

No French study has specifically addressed the notion of the burden of caregivers of stroke patients, their coping strategies, their experiences or emotional regulations. This type of study would however constitute a step towards the design and implementation of personalized care (eg: psychotherapies), by strengthening effective / adaptive strategies and modifying those which are less effective / poorly adaptive. This could improve the well-being of caregivers and their sick relatives, and direct health policies to reduce the economic impact of this aid."

NCT05515237,"Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy or CI Therapy is a form of treatment that systematically employs the application of selected behavioral techniques delivered in intensive treatment over consecutive day with the following strategies utilized: behavioral strategies are implemented to improve the use of the more- affected limb in life situation called a Transfer Package (TP), motor training using a technique called shaping to make progress in successive approximations, repetitive, task oriented training, and strategies to encourage or constrain participants to use the more-affected extremity including restraint of the less-affected arm in the upper extremity (UE) protocol. Numerous studies examining the application of CI therapy with UE rehabilitation after stroke have demonstrated strong evidence for improving the amount of use and the quality of the more-affected UE functional use in the participant's daily life situation.

CI Therapy studies with adults, to date, have explored intensive treatment for participants with a range from mild-to-severe motor impairment following stroke with noted motor deficits and limited use of the more-affected arm and hand in everyday activities. Each CI Therapy protocol was designed for the level of impairment demonstrated by participants recruited for the study. However, often following stroke, patients not only have motor deficits but somatosensory impairments as well. The somatosensory issues have not, as yet, been systematically measured and trained in CI Therapy protocols with adults and represent an understudied area of stroke recovery. We hypothesize that participants with mild-to-severe motor impairment and UE functional use deficits can benefit from CI therapy protocols that include somatosensory measurement and training components substituted for portions of motor training without loss in outcome measure gains. Further, we hypothesize that adults can improve somatosensory outcomes as a result of a combined CI therapy plus somatosensory component protocol."

NCT05007847,"No cause for stroke is found in up to 30% of cases despite extensive investigations. These are called cryptogenic strokes (CS). 1 in 4 stroke survivors will suffer another in 5 years and this is a leading cause of fear and anxiety. A common reason for CS is an undetected heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation (AF). AF occurs intermittently, so it may not be detected during the mandated 24-96 hours of rhythm monitoring that is performed as part of the standard post-stroke investigation strategy.

A randomised controlled study in 2014 showed that whereas this standard monitoring strategy picks up AF in 2% of CS patients, longer-term, continuous monitoring for 12 months can pick up AF in 13% of patients. This suggests the standard strategy may miss AF in a proportion of CS patients and thus also the opportunity to mitigate against further strokes with anticoagulation therapy. Prolonged monitoring has traditionally required a minimally-invasive surgical procedure to implant a recording device under the skin at a specialist centre. A specifically trained team is also required to interpret the large number of recordings this strategy yields.

The Apple Watch (AW) is a wristwatch able to monitor a wearer's heart rate and rhythm regularity and facilitates real- time, single-lead ECG recordings. This over-the-counter, non-invasive device has demonstrated feasibility and has a Certification (CE) Mark for detecting AF. It may offer a potential non-invasive alternative long-term rhythm surveillance strategy to diagnose AF in these patients.

The investigators propose a study in which CS patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive additional AW monitoring on top of standard care versus standard care alone. The investigators shall then explore the incidence of AF in the two groups at 1 year and how it impacts clinical outcomes too."

Subjects and assessors will be blinded to the condition making the experiment double blind. Specifically, subjects will be told that we are exploring a new therapy that using different sounds to improve therapy. Parallel group design will ensure that subjects in the Control group are unaware that their ""sounds"" are softer than the START group. Trainers may become aware that a loud sound is present thus a unique Assessor will evaluate clinical performance before and after training making the study double-blind. Fifty-four subjects will undergo baseline testing in the laboratory to establish their capacity for functional and expressive speech as well as their self-reported health-related quality of life (power analysis below). Next, subjects will participate in a high-frequency, word-picture verification/ auditory-repetition treatment, 2 hr/day for 5 consecutive days focusing on expression of words of functional significance (e.g., water, fall).

NCT01372059,"The initiative to the study is based on the fact that various forms of enriched environments and multimodal stimulation are found to have positive influences on motivation and psychosocial well-being and have been shown to facilitate multiple processes in the brain leading to structural regeneration and functional recovery. Since there is a lack of rehabilitation programs that encompass all dimensions of a stroke survivor's life researchers agree upon the need for a rehabilitation program that addresses both the social and physical needs of the patients. The aim with the project is to investigate whether it is possible to improve the life situation among patients with a history of stroke through a rhythm and music method and therapeutic riding. To get insights in the underlying mechanisms our research also focuses on relevant physiological, neurobiological and psychosocial mechanisms induced by the interventions. The hypothesis is that both treatment methods will mainly enhance participants' degree of participation.

The study is a randomized controlled trial where about 123 participants (50-75 years old) who had their stroke incident 1 - 5 years ago will be consecutively included and randomly allocated to the following three groups: a) Ronnie Gardiner Rhythm Music Method (RGRM) b) therapeutic riding c) a control group receiving RGRM after 9 months. Treatment proceeds during 12 weeks and evaluation takes place pre- and post intervention, and 12 and 24 weeks after the treatment is finalized. The evaluation consists of a thorough neuropsychological assessment, a physiotherapeutic assessment, sampling of blood and questionnaires covering mental, psychosocial, physical and psychological well-being. Interviews are also conducted in order to map the participants' experiences from the two treatment programs. Specially designed interviews are also planned to be carried through with participants having aphasia.

So far, there is only empirical support suggesting that RGRM has positive effects for individuals with a history of stroke making it significant to carry out research with the aim to contribute to strengthening the evidence of the method.

NCT01366729,"Background 9000 people a year in Switzerland suffer a first time stroke. Of these 20 to 30% remain unable to walk and up to 60% are left with moderate to severe walking disability.

Evidence shows that rehabilitation techniques which emphasise use of the hemiplegic side influence ipsilesional cortical plasticity and improve functional outcomes. Canes are commonly used in gait rehabilitation although they significantly reduce hemiplegic muscle activity. We have shown that an orthosis ""TheraTogs"" ( elastic corset supporting hemiplegic side) significantly increases hemiplegic muscle activity during gait.

To date no clinical studies have investigated the long term effects of these techniques on gait recovery following stroke.

This study aims to determine if advances in the understanding of cortical plasticity and its relation to functional recovery following stroke can be applied to clinical gait rehabilitation to improve long term outcomes.

Hypotheses Early gait rehabilitation with canes will reduce hemiplegic muscle activity and inhibit balance reactions. In the long term this causes poorer walking ability and balance and consequently reduced social participation.

Early gait rehabilitation with TheraTogs will increase hemiplegic muscle activity and facilitate balance reactions. In the long term this improves walking ability and balance leading to increased social independence and participation.

Design Multi-centred, single blind, randomized control trial. Subjects 120 first time stroke patients Intervention When subjects can walk unaided on even ground whilst requiring verbal prompts and stand-by help without body contact (FAC 3) they will be randomly allocated into intervention (TheraTogs) or control (cane) group. TheraTogs will be applied to support hip extensor and abductor musculature according to a standardized procedure. Cane walking with cane at the level of the radial styloid of the sound wrist. Subjects will walk throughout the day with the assigned walking aid. Standard therapy treatments and usual care will remain unchanged and documented.The intervention will continue for five weeks or until patients have reached FAC 5 (independent walkers on all surfaces).

Measures: the day before intervention begin, the day after intervention completion (max 5 weeks), 3 months, 6 months and 2 years after completion Primary outcome Timed ""up and go"" test Secondary outcomes surface EMG of hemiplegic lower extremity musculature, temporo-spatial gait parameters, hip kinematics, dynamic balance.

NCT01388400,"Stroke contributes significantly to the incidence of disabilities, with upper limb (UL) motor impairment being especially prevalent. Animal studies suggest that post-stroke motor recovery is largely attributable to adaptive plasticity in brain motor areas. While some environmental training factors contributing to plastic mechanisms have been identified in animals, translation of this knowledge to the clinical setting is insufficient. Optimal recovery may be related to both external (e.g., feedback type) and internal factors (e.g., cognitive ability, motivation). Clinically feasible methods for training are needed. Use of enriched virtual environments (VEs) may provide a way to address these needs. Outcome measures that best reflect recovery need to be identified since this is an essential step to evaluate the effect of novel training programs for UL motor recovery in stroke.

The research question is which clinical and kinematic outcome measures best reflect motor performance recovery after a targeted upper limb treatment intervention. Aim 1 is to compare changes in outcome measures recorded before and after an upper limb intervention in stroke subjects to motor performance in healthy subjects. Aim 2 is to determine motor performance between-group differences sample size is based on knowledge of expected outcome measure mean score differences between groups. Hypothesis. 1: Specific clinical and kinematic outcome measures will be sensitive to within-group (pre-post intervention training) changes. Hypothesis. 2: Specific clinical and kinematic outcome measures will be sensitive to between-group (healthy vs. patients in enriched vs. conventional intervention groups. Sixteen chronic stroke survivors and 8 age- and sex-matched healthy controls will participate. Patients will be matched on cognitive and motor impairment levels and divided into two groups. Using an single subject (A-B-A) research design, kinematics during two pre-tests, 3 weeks apart, will be recorded for test-retest reliability. Stroke groups will practice varied upper limb reaching movements (15 45-minute sessions in 3 weeks) in environments providing different motivation/feedback levels. Pre- and post motor performance evaluations will be done with clinical tests and a Test Task with specific motor performance requirements. A Transfer Task will also be recorded. By comparing data analysis methods (3-Dimensional (3D) analysis of different markers or placements), the investigators will identify which kinematic outcome measures best reflect motor improvement in post-test and follow-up sessions (retention).

The expected results are identification of two primary and two secondary outcome measures that reflect upper limb motor recovery and can distinguish between motor recovery and compensation. The results will be used to design a randomized control trial to determine the efficacy of VE-based treatment on arm motor recovery. The goal is to determine how extrinsic (environmental) and intrinsic (personal) motivational factors affect motor learning in stroke survivors with cognitive and physical impairment. Knowledge gained can also be used for rehabilitation of other neurological and orthopedic pathologies."
NCT01388127,"The investigators will perform a double blind controlled study to investigate the efficacy of oral administration of 200 mg minocycline, on the neurological and functional outcome after acute hemorrhagic stroke and the effect on blood brain barrier permeability."
NCT01395576,"Post stroke patients often suffer from decrease in strength, loss of balance and gait asymmetry. Accordingly, these patients are at high risk for falls and fall-related injury. The presence of spastic or retracted muscles, e.g. the ankle plantar flexors or the quadriceps in combination with hamstrings weakness, causes knee hyperextension, which increases the stance phase duration and makes it difficult to achieve symmetrical gait. Additionally, this gait disorder can be painful as a result of stress to the ligaments and tendons at the posterior aspect of the knee.

The Genu Neurexa orthosis is designed to stabilize the knee, enable balance control and prevent hyperextension. In order to assess the effect of the orthosis on the gait and balance characteristics of stroke patients the investigators will conduct subjective patient's satisfactory questionnaire, complete physical and functional evaluation and gait analysis, as well as dynamic electromyography (EMG) muscle activation patterns. These examinations will be performed 3 times: at the beginning of the trial, after one month and after two months. The trial design is explained in the following paragraph.

The investigators hypothesize that the gait pattern will be improved while using the knee orthosis,as will be expressed by smaller base width and faster walking velocity etc."
NCT01392391,"Chronic hemiparetic stroke is associated changes in body composition, skeletal muscle and cardiometabolic health; specific changes include paretic limb muscular atrophy, increased intramuscular fat deposition, elevated prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. This randomized intervention study compares a 6 month task oriented exercise programs versus control with both groups receiving best medical stroke care according to American Stroke Association ""Get with the Guidelines"". The hypothesis is that is 6 months of task-oriented exercise initiated early across the sub-acute period of stroke can prevent or ameliorate the natural course of these body composition, skeletal muscle and cardiometabolic health changes."
NCT01253512,"This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, multi-national, escalating dose, pilot study comparing two doses of THR-18 to placebo when administered to patients suffering acute ischemic stroke and treated with Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA).

The study hypothesis is that THR-18 will be safe and well tolerated in subjects suffering acute ischemic stroke and treated with Thrombolysis."
NCT01371409,"After a stroke the excitability of the brain decreases on the stroke side and increases on the opposite, non-stroke side. These changes make use of the stroke-affected arm difficult and slow recovery. Rehabilitation exercises that increase arm use after stroke help increase brain excitability, but the net effect of this approach is low. New therapies are needed that restore more equal levels of brain excitability between the two sides. Brain stimulation is a noninvasive way to affect activity the excitability of brain cells. Pairing brain stimulation with exercises that require patients to learn new movements may help the brain to learn. Using stimulation that reduces activity in the side opposite to the stroke can increase activity on the stroke -affected side, through connections between the two brain hemispheres. The purpose of this study is to test if brain stimulation on the side opposite to the stroke, paired with arm movement exercises, can help patients learn new arm movements and improve arm function.

In this study people with stroke will receive brain stimulation over two different areas on the side of the brain opposite to the stroke: 1) those areas responsible for movement and 2) those responsible for sensation. These experiments will test both the short and long term effects of brain stimulation on patients' learning and arm function and will allow us to identify which area of the brain best improves learning and arm function. These experiments have the potential to improve the effectiveness of rehabilitation after stroke. The proposed study is among the first to test stimulation over the side of the brain opposite to the stroke damage and at multiple sites. This unique approach may help stimulate the development of new methods for stroke rehabilitation."
NCT01339195,"Projections from epidemiological studies suggest that, among the Western adult population, one in three will present a cerebrovascular accident (stroke), severe cognitive disorders, or both. To better diagnose the Vascular Cognitive Impairment, new standards were developed by a North America working group which are under validation. It is essential to adapt these standard for French-speaking population, and especially to define cutoff scores of the cognitive battery to determine cognitive deficit.

The investigators propose a study coordinated by the University-Hospital of Amiens for french speaking centers. This study will investigate this battery with 906 controls to define the standards and 302 stroke affected patients to define the frequency and cognitive mechanisms. This step is essential for people to benefit from these new standards."
