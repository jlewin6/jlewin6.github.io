Some patients will also receive interleukin-2 (IL-2), a drug that may enhance the activity of the re-infused lymphocytes.

Patients with metastatic melanoma (melanoma whose tumor has spread) who have been treated unsuccessfully with gp100 vaccination may participate in this study. They will undergo apheresis or a tumor biopsy, or both, to collect lymphocytes. In apheresis, whole blood is drawn through a needle in the arm. A machine separates the blood components and removes the white cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a needle in the other arm. A biopsy is a surgical procedure to remove a small piece of tumor tissue.

Several weeks before the lymphocytes are collected, patients will receive injections of growth colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) every day for five days. This drug stimulates white cell production, permitting as many cells as possible to be obtained during collection. The lymphocytes will then be grown in larger numbers in the laboratory.

Seven days before the cells are re-infused, the patient is admitted to the hospital and a catheter (small tube) is placed in a large vein in the chest or neck. Two drugs, cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, are given through the tube. These drugs suppress the immune system so that it will not interfere with the work of the reinfused lymphocytes. The lymphocytes are then injected through the catheter over a 30-minute period. After the infusion, patients who receive IL-2 will be given the drug in a high dose over a 15-minute period every eight hours for up to five days. Patients whose condition does not permit high-dose IL-2, such as those with a heart condition or lung problem, may receive a low-dose regimen, with the drug given as a shot under the skin of the thigh or abdomen for five days followed by a 2-day break, continuing for a total of six weeks. These patients receive a higher dose the first week and then half that dose the next five weeks.

Blood and tissue samples will be taken before and during the study to evaluate the size of the tumor and assess treatment. If, 3-5 weeks after therapy is completed, the patient's tumor has stabilized or shrunk, the entire treatment, except for chemotherapy, may be repeated two more times."

Combining more than one drug and giving the drugs in different combinations may kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of standard combination chemotherapy treatment with more intensive combination chemotherapy in treating children with acute lymphocytic leukemia."

Doxil is chosen since recent studies have shown that it is superior to combination chemotherapy with ABV or BV. Doxil is also known to be active in other malignancies such as breast and ovarian cancer (34,35). PSC 833 is chosen since it has been found to reverse P-gp in vitro and in vivo, is non-immunosuppressive, and has been shown in recent Phase 1 studies to be well tolerated.

There are yet no human studies reported on Doxil pharmacokinetics when combined with MDR modulators. Preclinical data shows that pharmacokinetics of Doxil, unlike free doxorubicin, is minimally affected by the addition of PSC 833 (36). Enhanced tumor toxicity was observed when PSC 833 was combined with Doxil. Since doxorubicin, the active agent in Doxil, is metabolized by the same cytochrome P450, interactions between these 2 agents may have very significant clinical implications. The purpose of this study is to assess the toxicity and determine the maximum tolerated dose of Doxil when combined with PSC 833 in the treatment of AIDS-KS and other advanced malignancies."

stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer cells. Combining more than one drug with radiation therapy may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is most effective in treating Hodgkin's lymphoma.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying two different combination chemotherapy regimens and comparing how well they work, with or without radiation therapy, in treating patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma."

The study will look for ""markers"" that can help select the most effective type of chemotherapy. It will also evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new drug combination of capecitabine and docetaxel.

Patients age 18 years and older with stage II or III breast cancer whose tumor is 2 centimeters or larger may be eligible for this study. Those enrolled will be treated with surgery, standard chemotherapy using doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), and the capecitabine and docetaxel combination.

Patients will have a physical examination, mammogram and magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate their tumor before beginning treatment. They will then have four 21-day treatment cycles of docetaxel and capecitabine, as follows: docetaxel intravenously (through a vein) on day 1 and capecitabine pills (by mouth) twice a day from days 2 through 15. No drugs will be given from days 16 through 21. This regimen will be repeated four times, after which the tumor will be re-evaluated by physical examination, mammogram, and magnetic resonance imaging.

Patients will then have surgery to remove the cancer-either lumpectomy with removal of the underarm lymph nodes; mastectomy and removal of the underarm lymph nodes; or modified radical mastectomy. After recovery, they will have four more cycles of chemotherapy, this time with a doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Both drugs will be given intravenously on day 1 of four 21-day cycles.

Some patients who had a mastectomy (depending on their tumor characteristics and whether tumor cells were found in their lymph nodes) and all those who had a lumpectomy will also have radiation therapy. Patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors will also receive tamoxifen treatment for 5 years.

In addition to the above procedures, all patients will have tumor biopsies (removal of a small piece of tumor tissue) before beginning treatment, on day 1 of cycle 1, before cycle 2, and at the time of surgery, and physical examinations, chest X-rays, bone scans, computerized tomography (CT) scans, electrocardiograms, multi-gated acquisition scan-MUGA (nuclear medicine test of cardiac function) or echocardiograms of heart function, mammograms and blood tests at various times during the study. Patients will be followed at National Institutes of Health (NIH) for 3 years after diagnosis with physical examinations, blood tests, X-rays, and computed tomography (CT) scans.

Although it is not known whether this treatment will help an individual patient's cancer, possible benefits are tumor shrinkage and decreased risk of disease recurrence. In addition, the information gained about genetic changes after chemotherapy will help determine if additional studies on the use of cDNA microarray to measure tumor response are warranted."

The mainstay of therapy for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients remains systemic chemotherapy. Although partial remissions of up to 60% are obtained with conventional regimens, multiple myeloma is essentially an incurable disease with a median survival of approximately 30 months.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) results in a high percentage of complete remissions, but it can be associated with significant treatment-related mortality, which has been primarily attributed to conventional myeloablative transplant regimens.

Recent clinical studies have shown that highly immunosuppressive yet non-myeloablative doses of fludarabine-based chemotherapy can result in alloengraftment. Even with a reduction in treatment related mortality, success with allogeneic SCT is limited by a significant risk of relapse.

Donor immunization with myeloma Id in the setting of a non-myeloablative allogeneic SCT may represent a novel strategy for the treatment of multiple myeloma.

Objectives:

Primary Objectives:

To induce cellular and humoral immunity in allogeneic stem cell donors and recipients against the unique idiotype expressed by the recipient's myeloma.

To determine whether antigen-specific immunity, induced in the stem cell donor, can be passively transferred to the allogeneic SCT recipient in the setting of a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen.

Secondary Objectives:

To evaluate the effect of the Fludarabine-(etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, cyclophosphamide) EPOCH regimen on host T cell depletion and myeloid depletion prior to allogeneic SCT.

To determine the efficacy of a novel conventional chemotherapy regimen (Fludarabine-EPOCH) in the setting multiple myeloma.

To determine the treatment-related morbidity and mortality of allogeneic stem cell transplantation using a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen in multiple myeloma.

To determine if the re-vaccination of allogeneic stem cell donors with the unique idiotype expressed by the recipient's myeloma will enhance cellular and humoral immunity to patient specific-idiotype prior to lymphocyte donation for the treatment of patients with recurrent or progressive disease after transplantation.

Eligibility:

Patients 18-75 years of age with Immunoglobulin G (IgG) or Immunoglobulin A (IgA) multiple myeloma.

Patients must have achieved at least a partial remission following initial conventional chemotherapy regimen or after autologous stem cell transplantation.

Consenting first degree relative matched at 6/6 or 5/6 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antigens.

Design:

Phase 2 trial using a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen to reduce treatment-related toxicity.

Recipient will undergo a plasmapheresis to obtain starting material for the isolation of idiotype

protein. Donors would be immunized with an Id vaccine prepared from the patient.

Prior to transplantation patients would receive a conventional chemotherapy regimen which contains agents active in myeloma and is T cell depleting. The allogeneic SCT would be performed with a conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. The stem cell source would be blood mobilized with filgrastim. Recipients will be immunized with the Id vaccine following transplantation."

BMS 247550 belongs to a class of drugs called epothilones that interfere with the ability of cancer cells to divide. In the way they kill cells, they are very similar to a class of compounds known as the taxanes, which include the drug Taxol. Other characteristics of the epothilones, however, enable them to work in cells that are resistant to Taxol.

Patients 18 years of age or older with kidney cancer that has not spread to the central nervous system (unless the brain tumor has remained stable for at least six months after surgical or radiation treatment) may be eligible for this study. Pregnant or nursing women may not participate. Candidates are screened with various tests that may include blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram (EKG), and chest x-ray. Computerized tomography (CT) scans or X-rays, and possibly nuclear medicine studies may be done to determine the extent of disease.

Participants receive BMS 247550 by a 1-hour infusion into a vein for 5 consecutive days (days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) of each 21-day treatment cycle. Patients must stay in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) area near Bethesda, Maryland, for 7 to 8 days during the first treatment cycle and for the 5 days of treatment in subsequent cycles. The total number of cycles will vary among patients, depending on their individual clinical situation. The drug dose may be increased gradually in subsequent cycles in patients who can tolerate such increases. In addition, participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

Periodic physical examinations and frequent blood tests
X-ray and other imaging studies to determine if the tumor is responding to the treatment.
Tumor biopsies to confirm the diagnosis or spread of tumor and to examine the reaction of certain proteins in cancer cells to BMS 247550. Two biopsies will be done. For this procedure, a small piece of tumor tissue is withdrawn through a needle under local anesthetic.

Treatment will be stopped in patients whose tumor grows while receiving BMS 247550. Patients whose tumor disappears completely will be followed at NIH periodically for examinations and tests. Patients whose disease does not completely resolve or whose disease recurs may be advised of other appropriate research protocols at NIH or, if none are available, will be returned to the care of their local doctor."

Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow and blood stream that develop into blood cells. Stem cells transplanted from a healthy donor travel to the patient's bone marrow and begin producing normal cells. In patients with certain cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, the donor's immune cells attack the patient's cancer cells in what is called a ""graft-versus-tumor"" effect, contributing to cure of the disease. This study will determine whether this treatment can be used successfully to treat patients with sarcomas.

Patients between 4 and 35 years of age with a sarcoma that has spread from the primary site or cannot be removed surgically, and for whom effective treatment is not available, may be eligible for this study. Candidates must have been diagnosed by the age of 30 at the time of enrollment. They must have a matched donor (usually a sibling). Participants undergo the following procedures:

Donors: Stem cells are collected from the donor. To do this, the hormone granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is injected under the skin for several days to move stem cells out of the bone marrow into the bloodstream. Then, the cells are collected by apheresis. In this procedure the blood is drawn through a needle placed in one arm and pumped into a machine where the stem cells are separated out and removed. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a needle in the other arm.

Patients: For patients who do not already have a central venous catheter (plastic tube), one is placed into a major vein. This tube can stay in the body the entire treatment period for giving medications, transfusing blood, , withdrawing blood samples, and delivering the donated stem cells. Before the transplant procedure, patients receive from one to three cycles of ""induction"" chemotherapy, with each cycle consisting of 5 days of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone followed by at least a 17-day rest period. All the drugs are infused through the catheter except prednisone, which is taken by mouth. After the induction therapy, the patient is admitted to the hospital for 5 days of chemotherapy with high doses of cyclophosphamide, melphalan, and fludarabine. Two days later, the stem cells are infused. The anticipated hospital stay is about 3 weeks, but may be longer if complications arise. Patients are discharged when their white cell count is near normal, they have no fever or infection, they can take sufficient food and fluids by mouth, and they have no signs of serious graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-a condition in which the donor's cells ""see"" the patient's cells as foreign and mount an immune response against them.

After hospital discharge, patients are followed in the clinic at least once or twice weekly for a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests for 100 days. They receive medications to prevent infection and GVHD and, if needed, blood transfusions. If GVHD has not developed by about 120 days post transplant, patients receive additional white cells to boost the immune response. After 100 days, follow-up visits may be less frequent. Follow-up continues for at least 5 years. During the course of the study, patients undergo repeated medical evaluations, including blood tests and radiology studies, to check on the cancer and on any treatment side effects. On four occasions, white blood cells may be collected through apheresis to see if immune responses can be generated against the sarcomas treated in this study. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans may be done on five occasions. This test uses a radioactive material to produce images useful in detecting primary tumors and cancer that has spread."

The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune system and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving pentostatin before transplant and cyclosporine or mycophenolate mofetil after transplant may stop this from happening.

It also helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the transplanted stem cells. When the healthy stem cells are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. If the patient's stem cells are to be transplanted, the patient is also treated with a monoclonal antibody, such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin, to kill any remaining cancer cells or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective with or without gemtuzumab ozogamicin followed by stem cell transplant in treating acute myeloid leukemia.

The likelihood of melanoma returning is higher in patients who have melanoma lesions deep in the skin, in patients who have had positive lymph nodes, and in patients who have had surgery for metastatic disease (cancer that has spread beyond the primary site). Melanoma tumors produce proteins called glycoprotein 100 (gp100) and melanoma-associated antigen recognized by T cells 1 (MART-1). Vaccination with specific pieces of these proteins (peptides) may boost the immune system's fight against the cancer. The vaccine injections are mixed with an oil-based substance called Montanide ISA-51, which is intended to increase the immune response to the peptide.

Patients 16 years of age and older whose melanoma has been surgically removed and who are currently free of disease may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a physical examination and blood and urine tests. An electrocardiogram (EKG), x-rays and other imaging studies will be done if recent results are not available. Some candidates may require heart tests, such as a cardiac stress test or echocardiogram, or lung function tests. In addition, all candidates will be tested for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) tissue type; patients must be type human leukocyte antigens (HLA-A)*0201, the type on which this vaccine is based.

Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of four different vaccines to determine which peptides offer the best immunity. Each treatment course consists of two injections of the vaccines every 3 weeks for four times. The injections are given under the skin of the thigh. After every other treatment course (every 6 months), patients will undergo a series of x-rays and scans to look for tumor. The immunizations may continue for up to 12 months as long as the melanoma does not return. The injections are given at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center. Patients are monitored for 1 hour after each injection and have blood tests and a physical examination to look for treatment side effects.

Patients will be followed with blood tests every 12 weeks to monitor body functions. They will also undergo leukapheresis-a procedure to collect white blood cells-before starting treatment and about 3 to 4 weeks after the fourth vaccine to evaluate how the vaccines affect the action of the immune system cells. For this procedure, blood is drawn through a needle in the arm, similar to donating blood. The blood goes through a machine that separates out the lymphocytes (white blood cells), and the rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm. Some patients may undergo a biopsy-surgical removal of a small piece of tissue under local anesthetic-of normal skin and tumor or lymph node tissue to examine the effects of the vaccines on the tumor immune cells.

Patients whose disease returns during the first course of vaccine therapy will have surgery to remove the tumor and will continue to receive the vaccine treatment. Patients whose tumor returns after completing one course of therapy may receive a substance called interleukin-2 (IL-2), which can boost immune function against the tumor. interleukin-2 (IL-2) is given intravenously (through a small tube placed in a vein) every 8 hours for 4 days. This regimen is repeated after 10 to 14 days. Those who respond to interleukin-2 (IL-2) will have a third course of treatment after 2 months. Patients whose disease recurs after treatment will be taken off the study and will be referred back to their referring physician or to another study, if an appropriate one is available."

To assess the activity of sorafenib in a timely manner and with a meaningful interpretation, a randomized discontinuation design was adopted in the present trial, conducted in a population who were potentially sensitive to sorafenib.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying sorafenib to see how well it works compared to placebo in treating patients with refractory non-small cell lung cancer."

"NCT00067639","Multiple Myeloma","Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) for Stem Cell Mobilization in Patients With Multiple Myeloma","Completed","United States","20320551 / 20320550","Leukapheresis / PEG-G-CSF","Drug","In recent years PBPC have replaced bone marrow as the source of hematopoietic stem cells for autologous transplantation. One of the cited advantages of this procedure is the avoidance of bone marrow harvest, which frequently requires general anesthesia. Other advantages include faster neutrophil and platelet engraftment times, faster immune recovery, decrease in the amount of tumor contamination and technical ability to obtain stem cells from patients previously considered unharvestable because of marrow fibrosis or because of prior radiotherapy to the pelvis. Filgrastim has emerged as the preferred cytokine for stem cell mobilization based on its safety profile and the positive experience in granulocyte donors however, the number of circulating CD34+ cells does not occur until the third day after starting filgrastim injections. Pegfilgrastim stimulates the production and maturation of neutrophil precursors and enhances the functions of mature neutrophils in the same manner as filgrastim. Data form normal volunteers and in studies of patients with cancer have shown prolonged serum levels of the cytokine, with ""self-regulation"" of pegfilgrastim levels as a function of the neutrophil count. This confers a therapeutic advantage in clinical settings by allowing a less frequent dosing."

"NCT00083304","Breast Cancer","Whole Brain Radiation Therapy With Oxygen, With or Without RSR13, in Women With Brain Metastases From Breast Cancer","Completed","United States","20322120","RSR13","Drug","RSR13 (efaproxiral) is a radiation sensitizer that has shown positive results in a Phase 3, randomized clinical trial of patients with brain metastases. Of 111 eligible breast cancer patients with brain metastases in that trial, 59 patients who received RSR13 prior to radiation therapy had a median survival time that was twice as long as the 52 patients who did not receive RSR13 prior to radiation therapy.

RSR13 (efaproxiral) is an experimental drug that increases the amount of oxygen released from blood into the tissues. It is well known that certain types of cancer tumors, including those in brain metastases, lack oxygen. Lack of oxygen in a tumor can reduce the effect of radiation therapy (RT). RSR13 may increase the oxygen level in brain tumors so that radiation therapy works better.

This study will enroll up to 360 women with brain metastases from breast cancer, and will evaluate if whole brain radiation therapy given with RSR13 will have a better treatment effect than whole brain radiation therapy alone. RSR13 will be infused intravenously (IV) through a central catheter placed in a central vein. Women randomized (assigned) to receive RSR13, therefore, will need to have a central catheter placed for treatment unless one is already in place."

Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Cisplatin and docetaxel may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.

"NCT00088413","Adenocarcinoma","PANVAC-V and PANVAC-F Vaccines Plus Sargramostim to Treat Advanced Cancer","Completed","United States","20504485","Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor","Drug","Background:

Many cancers produce two proteins, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and mucin-1 (MUC-1).
The PANVAC-V (PANVAC vaccinia) priming vaccine and PANVAC-F (PANVAC fowlpox) boosting vaccine contain human genes that cause production of CEA and MUC-1, which can be used as a target for the immune system to attack the cancer. The vaccines also contain genes that cause production of other proteins that enhance immune activity.
Sargramostim is a protein that boosts the immune system.

Objectives:

To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PANVAC-V and PANVAC-F in patients with advanced cancer.
To document the immune response to the vaccines and any anti-tumor responses that may occur.

Eligibility: Patients 18 years of age and older with advanced cancer whose tumors produce CEA or MUC-1 protein

Design:

This trial has three cohorts: the first cohort includes 10 patients with advanced colorectal cancer and 10 to 15 patients with any advanced non-colorectal cancer that produces either EA or mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter 1 (MCU-1); the second cohort includes 12 patients with advanced breast cancer and the third cohort includes 14 patients with advanced ovarian cancer.
All patients receive PANVAC-V on study day 1, followed by PANVAC-F on days 15, 29 and 43 then every 28 days for up to 12 vaccines followed by every 3 months until disease progression or toxicity. The vaccines are given by injection under the skin. Sargramostim is injected at the vaccination site on the day of each vaccination and for the next 3 days following vaccination.
Patients whose scans show that their disease has progressed, but who are otherwise clinically stable may revert back to monthly injections.
Patients undergo apheresis to collect white blood cells (lymphocytes) on day 1 and day 71 of the study to measure the immune response to the treatment. Blood is collected through a needle placed in one arm and directed through a cell separator machine where the lymphocytes are extracted. The rest of the blood components are returned to the patient through the same needle.
Patients are monitored with frequent blood tests and periodic imaging tests (scans) to monitor for safety and the response to treatment."

"NCT00095901","Head and Neck Cancer","Capecitabine For Nasopharyngeal Cancer","Completed","United States","20324133","Xeloda","Drug","This study plans to examine the effects of Capecitabine administered as an oral chemotherapy drug in participants with nasopharyngeal cancer.

Capecitabine is an oral prodrug. A ""prodrug"" is a drug that is converted within the body into its active form that has medical effects. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which is a chemotherapy agent frequently used to treat head and neck cancers. Capecitabine is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and is converted to 5-FU. Capecitabine (Xeloda9) has been tested in subjects with colorectal and breast cancers, and shown to be effective in those cancers. Likewise, 5-FU has shown benefit when administered as a continuous infusion for those with nasopharyngeal cancers. Since Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-FU, it is possible that similar results will be achieved.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of capecitabine in treating patients who have locally recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer."

It will also examine the toxicity and blood effects of Revlimid.

Patients 18 years of age and older with stage IV ocular melanoma may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical and examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram, chest x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan and other imaging scans if needed, such as a bone scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, or positron emission tomography (PET).

Participants are admitted to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center for 24 hours for their first oral dose of Revlimid. During the hospital stay, blood is drawn before the dose is given and again at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12 and 24 hours after dosing to see how the body handles the drug. If the drug is well tolerated, patients are sent home with a 21-day supply of drug to take once a day for 21 days, then go off drug 7 days. This regimen constitutes one 28-day treatment cycle. Treatment cycles may continue for up to 2 years.

Patients keep a daily diary of side effects and have blood drawn once a week. The drug dose may be adjusted according to the laboratory test results. If unacceptable toxicity occurs, treatment may be stopped.

Patients who agree to be biopsied undergo this procedure before treatment begins and at the end of treatment cycles 3 and 6. A small area of skin is numbed with medicine and a small piece of tumor is removed with a needle or by a small cut in the tumor. The tissue is examined under a microscope.

Patients return to NIH after the first month of treatment and then every 3 months to evaluate their tumors and treatment of side effects.

The main purpose of this study is to see how their disease responds to consolidation treatment (treatment aimed at further decreasing cancer cells) with a radioactive antibody (protein) called iodine I 131 tositumomab (known by the tradename Bexxar®) and also to look at the side effects which occur with this type of treatment. The investigators will also be looking at how long disease responds to treatment, if it responds at all, and how long patients who have had this treatment survive.

Bexxar is a monoclonal antibody (protein) to which radioactive iodine 131 is attached. The monoclonal antibody in Bexxar (tositumomab), targets a protein called CD20 found on the surface of a variety of B-cells, including lymphoma cells, and some myeloma cells. The antibody is given as an infusion and finds its way to these cells. The radioactive iodine attached to the antibody delivers radiation directly to these cells which works to harm or kill the cancer cells. Approximately 20-25% of patients with multiple myeloma have this protein on the surface of their tumor cells. In addition, this protein was found on the surface of myeloma stem cells. While myeloma stem cells represent a minority of all myeloma cells (less than 5%), these cells are resistant to chemotherapy and are believed to be responsible for a recurrence of the disease after chemotherapy. In this study, Bexxar will be used after patients complete a course of chemotherapy and have residual myeloma cells left in their body. The Investigators are hoping that the treatment with Bexxar will decrease and possibly eliminate residual myeloma cells resistant to chemotherapy."

Tumor hypoxia and high levels of angiogenesis (blood vessel formation) are associated with treatment failure. Preclinical models reveal that radiotherapy itself may induce tumor secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Curability may consequently be reduced by multiple mechanisms. Over-expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) also occurs commonly and increases the risk of treatment failure. The addition of EGFR blockade to RT alone increases the chance of a cure. Concurrent VEGF and EGFR blockade could be synergistic with one another and improve the effectiveness of concurrent chemoradiation for advanced head and neck cancer.

This study will add angiogenic and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) blockade into an established program of curative intent concurrent chemoradiation for locally advanced head and neck cancer.

However, most patients do not have an appropriate HLA (immune type) matched sibling donor available and/or are unable to identify an acceptable unrelated HLA matched donor through the registries in a timely manner. Another option is haploidentical transplant using a partially matched family member donor.

Although haploidentical transplant has proven curative in many patients, this procedure has been hindered by significant complications, primarily regimen-related toxicity including GVHD and infection due to delayed immune reconstitution. These can, in part, be due to certain white blood cells in the graft called T cells. GVHD happens when the donor T cells recognize the body tissues of the patient (the host) are different and attack these cells. Although too many T cells increase the possibility of GVHD, too few may cause the recipient's immune system to reconstitute slowly or the graft to fail to grow, leaving the patient at high-risk for significant infection.

For these reasons, a primary focus for researchers is to engineer the graft to provide a T cell dose that will reduce the risk for GVHD, yet provide a sufficient number of cells to facilitate immune reconstitution and graft integrity. Building on prior institutional trials, this study will provide patients with a haploidentical graft engineered to specific T cell target values using the CliniMACS system. A reduced intensity, preparative regimen will be used in an effort to reduce regimen-related toxicity and mortality.

Two groups of patients were enrolled on this study. One group included those with high-risk hematologic malignancies and the second group included participants with refractory hematologic malignancies or undergoing a second transplant. The primary aim of the study was to estimate the relapse rate in the one group of research participants with refractory hematologic malignancies or those undergoing second allogeneic transplant. Both groups will be followed and analyzed separately in regards to the secondary objectives.

This study was closed to accrual on April 2006 as it met the specific safety stopping rules regarding occurrence of severe graft vs. host disease. Although this study is no longer open to accrual, the treated participants continue to be followed as directed by the protocol."

This study is being done to find out how long it takes tumors to grow after patients receive the drugs capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab. Capecitabine (also called Xeloda) is a drug that has been approved by the FDA for treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. Capecitabine prevents some colorectal cancer cancer cells from reproducing, and causes some of them to die. Oxaliplatin (also called Eloxatin) has also been approved by the FDA for treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. Oxaliplatin prevents some colorectal cancer cells from reproducing. Bevacizumab is an investigational drug. Bevacizumab is an antibody (a protein that acts against a specific substance) directed against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF promotes the growth of blood vessels that bring nutrients to cells. Bevacizumab inhibits the growth of colon cancer cells, by blocking the effects of VEGF. The combination of the drugs used in this study is experimental. The purpose of this study is to see how long it takes patients' tumors to grow when they are taking this combination of drugs."

"NCT00179309","Breast Cancer","Docetaxel Alone or in Combination With Vaccine to Treat Breast Cancer","Completed","United States","20502536 / 20502533","GM-CSF / Taxotere","Drug","This study will test whether giving a combination of a vaccine together with docetaxel is more effective against breast cancer than docetaxel alone. The Food and Drug Administration has approved docetaxel to treat many cancers, including breast cancer. The vaccine consists of three parts: 1) a ""priming vaccine"" called PANVAC (PAN (all) VAC (vaccine)) trademark [TM]-V, which is made from vaccinia virus; 2) a ""boosting vaccine"" called PANVAC[TM]-F, made from fowlpox virus; and 3) sargramostim, or granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a protein that may help boost the immune system. Human genes are inserted into the vaccinia and fowlpox viruses to cause production of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and mucin 1 (MUC-1)-two proteins that are often produced by cancer cells and can be used as a target for the immune system to attack the cancer. Another type of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is inserted to cause production of other proteins that enhance immune activity.

Patients 18 years of age or older with metastatic breast cancer (disease that has spread beyond the original site) and whose cancer produces CEA or mucin 1 (MUC-1) protein may be eligible for this study. Patients must have antigen type human leukocyte antigen A2 (HLA-A2). They may have received adjuvant docetaxel treatment at least 3 months before entering this study, prior hormonal therapy and up to three chemotherapy regimens. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram, and computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging scans.

Participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups - docetaxel alone or docetaxel plus vaccine - as follows:

Docetaxel Alone

All patients receive docetaxel. The drug is infused through a vein over 30 to 60 minutes once a week for 3 consecutive weeks with 1 week off drug. Patients also take dexamethasone 12 hours and 1 hour before and 12 hours after the docetaxel to help prevent fluid retention (edema) that docetaxel may cause.

Docetaxel Plus Vaccine

Participants receive the priming vaccination followed by monthly boosting vaccinations, along with the weekly docetaxel therapy. With every vaccination, patients also receive an injection of sargramostim to increase the number of immune cells at the vaccination site. Sargramostim injections are given the day of vaccination and daily for the next 3 days. All vaccine and sargramostim doses are given as injections under the skin, usually in the thigh. Patients are observed in the clinic for 1 hour after each injection.

Patients have blood tests every four weeks to monitor drug side effects and before every vaccination to check blood counts. A bone scan or CT scan (or both) is done every 2 to 3 months to check the response to treatment.

Patients may continue receiving treatment as long as their disease does not worsen and they can tolerate the treatment without significant side effects. Patients assigned to receive docetaxel alone whose disease progresses after 3 months on the drug may choose to receive the vaccine or come off the study to receive other treatment options. Patients are monitored with yearly telephone calls for up to 15 years."

Vandetanib is a new type of agent that targets the blood supply to a cancer tumour (through it's anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) properties) and the tumour cells themselves (through it's anti-endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) actions). This study will look at the effects of vandetanib in lung cancer patients who have had their cancer re-appear after treatment with standard chemotherapy.

This clinical study will test if the vandetanib anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR characteristics can deliver longer improved progression free survival and improved overall survival than docetaxel (Taxotere) alone.

All patients participating this clinical study will receive treatment with docetaxel, a commonly used treatment for recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.

In addition, some patients will also receive vandetanib (ZACTIMA), an anti-EGFR / anti-VEGF agent.

Recent clinical research shows that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibition, when used with standard chemotherapy, can lead to increased survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.

Other research shows that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, like erlotinib (Tarceva) can also increase overall non-small cell lung cancer survival by killing tumour cells and stopping them from dividing."

It is also the aim of this research project to determine what the effects, good and/or bad, are of combining capecitabine (Xeloda) with PHY906 (investigational drug) in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.

PHY906 is a powder from plants sold as a health food supplement in the United States. PHY906 has been used in China, Taiwan and other Asian countries as traditional Chinese medicine for hundreds of years.

The other drug involved in this study, capecitabine is an oral form of chemotherapy already approved by FDA in the management of colorectal and breast cancer.

Laboratory studies in animal models have shown that the combination of capecitabine and PHY906 shrinks liver cancer, and a pilot clinical study is currently evaluating this combination in patients with liver cancer to define the benefit. PHY906 has also shown to decrease diarrhea related to chemotherapy in a small study performed in patients with colon cancer treated at the Yale Cancer Center. Our recent laboratory studies have also shown that the combination of capecitabine and PHY906 also shrink pancreatic tumors in mouse models. This prompted us to test the combination of capecitabine and PHY906 in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer to assess the benefit in survival as well as any decrease in side effects, such as diarrhea caused by capecitabine."

It has shown antitumor effects in the laboratory, but has not been approved at this time for the treatment of cancer. Herceptin is a new form of chemotherapy that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of breast cancer.

This study is designed to evaluate the effect and safety of combining Rapamune and Herceptin on breast cancer. Rapamune and Herceptin are being combined because results from our laboratory studies suggest that the combination of the two drugs is superior to either drug used alone. Results from laboratory studies performed at other institutions suggest that adding Rapamune to Herceptin may also reverse the resistance to Herceptin. Although there has been extensive experience using Herceptin alone and Rapamune alone in human subjects, the combination of Herceptin and Rapamune has not been previously evaluated. In addition, we hope to better understand how these treatments work against an individual woman's tumor by analyzing tissue samples before, and during treatment."

they work in treating participants with lymphoid malignancies undergoing stem cell transplant. Giving chemotherapy before a stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the participant they may help the participant's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells called graft versus host disease. Giving tacrolimus and methotrexate after the transplant may stop this from happening. Giving bortezomib and chemotherapy may work better in treating participants with lymphoid malignancies undergoing a stem cell transplant."

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are aggressive subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Flavopiridol is an investigational drug that works differently from standard chemotherapy and may target abnormalities in MCL and DLBCL cells, such as a protein excess that prevents tumor cells from dying.

A challenge in developing flavopiridol for treatment has been determining its optimal dosing schedule. The schedule used for this study is effective in a type of leukemia called chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and may benefit patients with MCL and DLBCL also.

Objectives:

To determine the highest dose of flavopiridol that can be given safely to patients with relapsed MCL and DLBCL at the dosing schedule detailed below

To assess the response of the tumor to flavopiridol given at the test dosing schedule

Eligibility:

Patients 18 years of age and older with relapsed MCL or DLBCL

Design:

Flavopiridol is given at four different dose levels, starting with the lowest dose for the first group of three to six patients and increasing with subsequent groups, depending on side effects at the preceding dose. The drug is given weekly for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week break (one cycle) for up to six cycles. It is given through a vein as a 30-minute infusion followed by a 4-hour infusion.

Patients undergo the following procedures for research studies and to evaluate the effect of treatment on the tumor:

Blood tests
Lymph node, bone marrow and tumor biopsies
Lymphapheresis to collect blood cells for research
Disease staging with imaging studies (computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after every 2 cycles"

Pancreas Ca","Completed","United States","20357870 / 20357871","Erbitux / Gemzar","Drug","RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Others interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cetuximab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Gemcitabine and cetuximab may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving gemcitabine together with cetuximab and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gemcitabine when given together with cetuximab and radiation therapy in treating patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery."

Objectives:

To determine whether TCR-engineered lymphocytes can be put in cells removed from patients' tumors or blood and then reinfused, with the purpose of shrinking tumors.
To evaluate safety and effectiveness of the treatment.

Eligibility:

Patients 18 years of age or older with metastatic cancer melanoma (cancer that has spread beyond the original site).
Patient's leukocyte antigen type is HLA-A 0201.

Design:

-Patients undergo the following procedures:

Leukapheresis (on two occasions). This is a method of collecting large numbers of white blood cells. The cells obtained in the first leukapheresis procedure are grown in the laboratory, and the anti-MART-1 protein is inserted into the cells using an inactivated (harmless) virus in a process called retroviral transduction. Cells collected in the second leukapheresis procedure are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the study treatment.
Chemotherapy. Patients are given chemotherapy through a vein (intravenously, IV) over 1 hour for 2 days to suppress the immune system so that the patient's immune cells do not interfere with the treatment.
Treatment with anti-melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells (MART)-1. Patients receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of the treated cells containing anti-MART-1 protein, followed by infusions of a drug called IL-2 (aldesleukin), which helps boost the effectiveness of the treated white cells.
Patients are given support medications to prevent complications such as infections.
Patients may undergo a tumor biopsy (removal of a small piece of tumor tissue).
Patients are evaluated with laboratory tests and imaging tests, such as CT (computed tomography) scans, 4 to 6 weeks after treatment and then once a month for 3 to 4 months to determine the response to treatment.

An adaptive cell transfer therapy has been pioneered, in which cells are grown for a short time in the laboratory. The way they are grown may have a better effect in a patient's body than do other cells that are cultured for a longer time.

Objectives:

To determine whether tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) can be put in cells removed from patients' tumors or blood and then reinfused, with the purpose of shrinking tumors.
To evaluate safety and effectiveness of the treatment.

Eligibility:

Patients 18 years of age or older with metastatic cancer melanoma (cancer that has spread beyond the original site).
Patient's leukocyte antigen type is human leukocyte antigens (HLA-A) 0201.

Design:

-Patients undergo the following procedures:

Leukapheresis (on two occasions). This is a method of collecting large numbers of white blood cells. The cells obtained in the first leukapheresis procedure are grown in the laboratory, and the TIL cells (called young TIL cells) are inserted into the cells using an inactivated (harmless) virus in a process called retroviral transduction. Cells collected in the second leukapheresis procedure are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the study treatment.
Chemotherapy. Patients are given chemotherapy through a vein (intravenously, IV) over 1 hour for 2 days to suppress the immune system so that the patient's immune cells do not interfere with the treatment.
Treatment with young TIL cells. Patients receive an IV infusion of the treated cells, followed by infusions the drug aldesleukin-2 (IL-2), which helps boost the effectiveness of the treated white cells.
Patients are given support medications to prevent complications such as infections.
Patients may undergo a tumor biopsy (removal of a small piece of tumor tissue).
Patients are evaluated with laboratory tests and imaging tests, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, 4 to 6 weeks after treatment and then once a month for 3 to 4 months to determine the response to treatment.
Patients have blood tests at 3, 6, and 12 months and then annually for 5 years."

Major problems with stem cell transplantation (SCT) for cancer treatment are a lack of suitable donors for patients without a human leukocyte-antigen (HLA) tissue-matched sibling and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a serious side effects of immune-suppressing chemotherapy that is given to bring the cancer under control before SCT. In GVHD, the patients immune system attacks the transplanted donor cells.

This study will try to improve the results of SCT from unrelated HLA-matched donors using targeted immune-depleting chemotherapy to bring the cancer under control before transplantation and to lower the chance of graft rejection, followed by reduced-intensity transplant chemotherapy to make the procedure less toxic.

Objectives:

To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of targeted immune-depleting chemotherapy followed by reduced-intensity transplant chemotherapy in patients with advanced cancers of the blood and immune system.

To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of two different drug combinations to prevent GVHD. Both regimens have been successful in preventing GVHD, but they work by different mechanisms and affect the rebuilding of the immune system after the transplant.

Eligibility:

People 18 to 74 years of age with advanced or high-risk cancers of the blood and immune system who do not have a suitable HLA-matched sibling.

Design:

All patients receive chemotherapy before transplant to treat the cancer and suppress immune function.

All patients receive a conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide for 4 days and fludarabine for 4 days before SCT to prepare for the transplant.

Patients are randomly assigned to one of two combination drug treatments to prevent GHVD as follows:

Group 1: Tacrolimus starting 3 days before SCT and continuing for 6 months, plus methotrexate on days 1, 3, 6, and 11 post-SCT, plus sirolimus starting 3 days before the SCT and continues for 6 months following SCT.
Group 2: Alemtuzumab for 4 days starting 8 days before SCT, plus cyclosporine starting 1 day before SCT and continuing for 6 months.

Patients receive the donors stem cells and immune cells 2 days after completing the conditioning regimen.

Patients are followed at the clinic regularly for the first 6 months after SCT, and then less often for at least 5 years. Some visits may include bone marrow aspirates and biopsies, blood draws, and other tests to monitor disease status.

A skin biopsy, oral mucosa biopsy, and saliva collection are done to study chronic GVHD.

However, allogeneic transplantation is associated with a significant risk of potentially life threatening complications due to the effects of chemotherapy and radiation on the body and the risks of serious infection. In addition, patients may develop a condition called Graft versus host disease that arises from an inflammatory reaction of the donor cells against the recipient's normal tissues. The risk of graft versus host disease is somewhat increased in patients who are receiving a transplant from an unrelated donor.

One approach to reduce the toxicity of allogeneic transplantation is a strategy call nonmyeloablative or ""mini"" transplants. In this approach, patients receive a lower dose of chemotherapy in an effort to limit treatment related side effects. Patients undergoing this kind of transplant remain at risk for graft versus host disease particularly if they receive a transplant from an unrelated donor. The purpose of this research study is to examine the ability of a drug called CAMPATH-1H to reduce the risk of graft versus host disease and make transplantation safer. CAMPATH-1H binds to and eliminates cells in the system such as T cells that can cause graft versus host disease (GvHD). As a result, earlier studies have shown that patients who receive CAMPATH-1H with an allogeneic transplant have a lower risk of GvHD. In the present study, we will examine the impact of treatment with CAMPATH-1H as part of an allogeneic transplant on the development of GvHD and infection. In addition, we will study the effects of CAMPATH-1H on the immune system by testing blood samples in the laboratory."

In this trial, the standard chemotherapy is being combined with bevacizumab. Bevacizumab is an antibody which works differently from the way other chemotherapy drugs work. Bevacizumab slows or stops cell growth in cancerous tumors by decreasing the blood supply to the tumors by binding to a substance found on cancer cells called VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). Bevacizumab is approved by the FDA for the treatment of colorectal cancer and lung cancer. However, it is not approved for the treatment of breast cancer. Another goal of this research is to determine whether we can develop a way to identify tumors that will respond well to this study treatment."

It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving antithymocyte globulin before transplant and cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and methotrexate before and after transplant may stop this from happening.

PURPOSE: Natural Killer (NK) cells from the donor's bone marrow may be important in fighting leukemia. Bone marrow donors can be selected based on the type of NK cells they have, specifically the killer immunoglobulin receptor (KIR) type. This study provides information on KIR type from potential donors, which can be used in selecting the bone marrow donor.

Because it was traditionally viewed as a local disease, many advocated the use of radical surgery to achieve maximum survival benefit. This view has been slowly replaced by a broader biologic view that recognizes the often systemic nature of breast cancer, even when it appears to be localized to the breast. Results from randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that less extensive surgery, or lumpectomy plus radiation therapy, are optimal for local management of early breast cancer. In addition to the less radical approach to surgical treatment of breast cancer, other randomized clinical trials have established the value of postoperative systemic therapy in improving overall survival by eradicating micrometastatic disease, the major cause of mortality from breast cancer. Despite the well-documented benefits of adjuvant systemic therapy, it is not effective in preventing death from breast cancer in all patients who are candidates for such treatment. The worth of such therapy can only be judged in retrospect upon disease relapse, a time when breast cancer is nearly always incurable. Currently, there are few reliable methods to predict the success or failure of a particular postoperative treatment modality, and better ways to predict and optimize outcome are needed.

Combination endocrine therapy: Using endocrine agents with different mechanisms of action together has the potential advantage of more effectively blocking ER signaling, thus improving the efficacy of such agents against breast cancer. In the past, attempts to combine endocrine agents for ER-positive breast cancer have had mixed results, depending on the setting and the patient population studied.

Endocrine agents without any agonist effect could potentially be used in combination with aromatase inhibitors, under the rationale that the combination would maximally blockade estrogen receptor signaling, thus potentially improving the antitumor effect. Fulvestrant (FASLODEX) is a pure estrogen antagonist with no known agonist effect; thus, it has the potential to provide additional benefit when combined with an aromatase inhibitor. This concept provides the rationale for using the combination of anastrazole and fulvestrant in this study."

Thus, we are interested in investigating Abraxane's safety, toxicity, and efficacy profile for the treatment of recurrent transitional cell cancer of the urinary bladder in a combined phase I & II trial. The phase I trial is designed as a dose-escalation study with cohorts of threes that will enroll a maximum of 18 patients. Dose increases will occur in groups of three patients, with each successive group receiving an increased concentration of Abraxane intravesically. No dose increase will occur until each member of the previous cohort has undergone the first instillation of the medication without experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Any patient who experiences a DLT will be removed from the trial and treated appropriately.

If one patient in the cohort experiences a DLT an additional three patients will be enrolled and treated at that dose-level. If none of the additional three patients experience a DLT, the next group of patients will be started on the next higher dose level.

If at any dose level, two or more patients experience a DLT the previous dose level will be considered as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). An additional three patients (for a total of six patients) will then be treated at the MTD. If less than two patients experience a DLT this dose level will be established as the MTD. The phase II aspect is designed in a Simon II stage format in which to satisfy our study powering, the first stage there will be 10 patients enrolled. If there are 2 or more successful treatments in that group (negative urine cytology and bladder biopsy after 6 months), then the first stage will pass the rejection rule, and up to another 19 patients will be enrolled. If at any point in the study, there have been a total of 6 or more successes, then the phase II aspect will be considered a successful trial and the study will be completed at that point."

Since 1993, we have used a combination of chemotherapy known as ICE (Ifosfamide, Carboplatin, and Etoposide) for your type of lymphoma. In many patients, this treatment helps the disease to shrink before giving high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Only patients who respond to these types of treatments have a chance of their disease going away (remission) with an ASCT. In 1999, we studied the same treatment but added another medicine for your type of lymphoma, Rituximab (Rituxan), to the ICE treatment (RICE). More patients had lymphoma shrinkage from this treatment (chemosensitive disease) than with ICE alone. These patients then received high dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplant and have an improved chance of having a remission.

ICE chemotherapy is standard chemotherapy used at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. However, it is different in this study because of the higher doses. We are testing higher doses of RICE treatment for patients in this study.

In our current study in Hodgkin's lymphoma, we are giving these higher doses of ICE (called augmented ICE) to patients who also have higher risk. We hope to show in this study that by using Rituximab and augmented ICE that we can improve your ability to achieve a remission (that is, to have the disease go away)."

We also want to study the melanoma before and after temozolomide treatment to learn why some tumors respond and others do not. This is a Phase II trial. This means that it will test a drug - in this case, temozolomide -- that has already been studied and shown to be safe.

Surgery, when possible, is the main treatment for patients with melanoma like yours. In most people, however, melanoma cells have already spread to other places in the body. This means that even with surgery, many people will have the melanoma come back. This is often fatal.

One goal of this trial is to treat the melanoma cells that might have spread before they have a chance to grow.

As part of this trial, we also study which genes are turned on and which genes are turned off in your tumor. We will obtain tumor from the biopsy done before you started temozolomide treatment and from the tumor removed during the surgery done after you finish temozolomide treatment. This may help us understand how temozolomide works and how to recognize which tumors will respond.

Before and during the temozolomide treatment, we will also test a new way of measuring the amount of tumor present. This involves a special way of analyzing the CT scan which you will have anyway. This new technique may allow us to see tumor shrinkage very early in the treatment course."

After these drugs are given for 2 courses, a second goal is to see how long a remission lasts. A third goal is to see how often repeat remissions can be achieved when the lymphoma returns later and the same drugs are restarted.

This is an investigational study. The FDA has approved each of these drugs for the treatment of low-grade lymphoma. The combined use of these drugs for Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia is investigational, although each drug has been effective by itself for this disease. About 50 patients will take part in this study. This study will take place only at UTMDACC (outpatient basis)."

For tumors of comparable histology and grade, resectability is the most important prognostic factor affecting survival particularly in children.

Blood vessels that supply the tumor are formed through a process called angiogenesis. Vandetanib is an investigational drug that acts by producing what is called an anti-angiogenic effect. An Anti-angiogenic effect is able to inhibit the development of new blood vessels required by tumors to survive by blocking the growth factors needed to form new blood vessels.

It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells.

The resulting symptoms, most notably hot flashes, can cause significant detriment to a patient's quality of life. Treatment for menopausal symptoms with the gold standard of hormone replacement therapy is not done routinely as it is unclear whether it can increase risk of tumor recurrence. In addition, many medical oncologists feel it is contraindicated in this population, especially among women whose breast cancers have estrogen receptors. This has lead to an increased interest in options other than estrogen replacement in the treatment of hot flashes, though most investigations of alternative medications have shown a suboptimal response.

Recent studies have suggested that non-drug treatments using alternative or complementary therapies may be effective. Specifically, hypnosis has been promoted as a means to control hot flashes, though it has not been tested in a randomized fashion. In accordance with the National Cancer Institute's recent initiatives to expand the goals of clinical trials to include symptom management studies, our purpose is to evaluate the role of complementary and alternative therapies for improvement of symptoms in women with breast cancer. Specifically, we plan to evaluate the use of hypnotherapy for the treatment of therapy-induced hot flashes in breast cancer survivors. We intend to recruit 60 women into a pilot feasibility trial comparing hypnotherapy to the drug gabapentin (Neurontin®) for the treatment of therapy-induced hot flashes in eligible women who are receiving care at the Breast Health Center. We have chosen gabapentin based on recent studies showing it may be an effective non-estrogen treatment for this indication.

We will identify patients who are experiencing at least one daily hot flash as a result of the treatment they received for their breast cancer for participation. When enrolled, they will be randomized into either the treatment arm, in which they will receive daily gabapentin, or the experimental arm, in which they will undergo weekly hypnotherapy.

Our study hypothesis is that hypnotherapy will be more effective than gabapentin in the control of hot flashes in this population."

hematological cancer. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation (TBI) before a donor umbilical cord blood transplant helps stop the growth of cancer and abnormal cells and helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from an unrelated donor, that do not exactly match the patient's blood, are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells (called graft-versus-host disease). Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil before and after transplant may stop this from happening."

Based on the investigators hypothesis that upregulation of functional estrogen receptors in the premalignant lesions is also responsible for the development of hormone independent tumors, the investigators postulate that the combination of antiestrogens and omega-3 fatty acids will reduce the development of both hormone-dependent and -independent tumors. At present, there are no known interventions able to decrease the development of hormone-independent tumors, which are more prevalent, more aggressive, leading to the patient's demise. In addition, the investigators postulate that this approach will be safe since it will combine a lower and hence a less toxic dose of Raloxifene with the administration of omega-3 fatty acids which are known to have health benefits, i.e., reduction in cardiovascular risk, beyond their possible chemo preventive effect in breast cancer."

The purpose of this study is to determine if Kanglaite Injection (KLT) is safe in patients with cancer of the pancreas, and whether it improves the effectiveness of gemcitabine. Additionally, the effect, if any, of KLT on the signs and symptoms of cancer as well as the common side effects of chemotherapy will be evaluated.

The research drug, KLT, is purified from a traditional Chinese medicine called coix seed. It is approved in China for use in combination with chemotherapy to treat patients with advanced lung cancer and liver cancer. It is also approved in China for use by itself to treat the symptoms of cancer in patients with advanced cancer of any kind. In the US, KLT is purely experimental and is not approved for any use. While a small number of cancer patients in the US have received KLT alone in a Phase I study, this is the first US protocol to evaluate whether or not KLT is useful in pancreatic cancer.

This phase II clinical study was completed in the US in June 2014. The clinical study report was submitted to the FDA in January 2015. The designs of the phase III clinical study for KLT has been cleared by the FDA in May 2015 and will be launched soon."

Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Motexafin gadolinium may make cancer cells more sensitive to radiation therapy and combination chemotherapy. Giving motexafin gadolinium together with chemotherapy, rituximab, and radiation therapy may kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving motexafin gadolinium together with combination chemotherapy, rituximab, and whole-brain radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with newly diagnosed primary central nervous system lymphoma."

Histone deacetylases (HDAC) facilitate gene transcription by modulating the uncoiling of chromatin. HDAC function is dysregulated in hematologic and solid malignancies, and this dysregulation may result in over-expression of oncogenes. Thus, inhibition of HDACs may result in anti-cancer effects. HDAC inhibitors, like vorinostat, represent a new class of antitumor agents that have the ability to induce antiproliferative effects including cyto-differentiation, cell cycle growth arrest or apoptosis in various cancer cell lines. Several studies have investigated the in vitro antimyeloma activity of vorinostat in combination with bortezomib and have demonstrated that vorinostat may act synergistically with bortezomib to modulate tumor cell growth. Mitsiades et al have shown that vorinostat enhances the sensitivity of bortezomib. Pei et al found that exposure of human multiple myeloma cell lines & patient-derived multiple myeloma cells to bortezomib and vorinostat resulted in synergistic interactions as a result of: (1) Interruption of NF-kB & related signaling pathways (JNK, XIAP, Mcl-1, etc.) (2) Inhibition of Hsp90 (3)Induction of ER stress signal and (4) acetylation of Dynein/disruption of aggresome function/formation, salvage for ubiquitinated proteins. In addition a marked increase in mitochondrial injury, caspase activation, and apoptosis was also observed. Bortezomib is indicated for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. Two Phase I dose-ranging studies of a regimen combining vorinostat and bortezomib among patients with relapsed as well asend-stage, refractory multiple myeloma have been conducted. These studies enrolled a total of 57 patients. In these studies, administration of vorinostat with standard doses of bortezomib resulted in responses in 20/45 (44%) evaluable patients (Weber et al 2007, Badros et al 2007). The purpose of the present study is to definitively evaluate the clinical activity of vorinostat in combination with bortezomib inpatients with multiple myeloma."

Lapatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Studying samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients may help doctors understand how well these drugs can be carried to the brain.

PURPOSE: More definitive knowledge of the penetration of chemotherapeutic and other agents into the brain is necessary for the future rational design of drug and drug regimens that target brain metastases. This clinical trial is studying how well capecitabine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, lapatinib, paclitaxel, trastuzumab, or vinorelbine penetrates brain tumors."

High breast density has been associated with an increased risk in breast cancer. It has also been shown that decreasing density with a drug called tamoxifen has resulted in a decreased risk in breast cancer. The investigators are looking at the effect of hCG on breast density in people who are at increased risk of developing breast cancer and our theory postulates that through the hormonal actions of hCG and tamoxifen there would be a greater reduction in breast density in patients who are treated with hCG and tamoxifen versus patients treated with tamoxifen alone. Using this data the investigators will be able to hypothesize that the treatment of hCG will result in a reduction in breast cancer rates in the population and thus make available another drug which can be used to decrease the rates of breast cancer in the population"

Contrast-enhanced MRI is the current standard for evaluating the success of therapy and monitoring for tumor recurrence. MRI is typically obtained prior to initial surgery, within 24 hours after surgery, at the conclusions of cranial irradiation, and then every 8 weeks during temozolomide chemotherapy until evidence of recurrence. Despite this careful clinical and radiographic surveillance, and despite decades of research into the histologic and molecular classification of primary brain tumors, our ability to predict tumor behavior remains very limited. Some gliomas will result in overall survival times of only months, whereas other histologically-identical gliomas may yield survivals of years to decades [Carson 2007, Curran 1993, Lamborn 2004]. Current assessment of tumor response to therapy is also poor. Patients with complete radiographic response after cranial irradiation often progress rapidly post-irradiation. In contrast, some patients with enhancing masses at the end of chemoradiotherapy may respond dramatically to further chemotherapy alone, or the masses may even disappear in the absence of further therapy (so called ""tumor pseudoprogression"") [Chamberlain 2007]. This confounding situation demonstrates a need for better assessment of tumor response."

Results have shown that participants treated on these studies had better outcomes (meaning they have lived longer and had better responses to treatment) when compared to individuals treated with standard chemotherapy.

Past studies conducted at the MIRT and at other institutions have shown that participants with high-risk features by gene array studies tend to have shorter remissions (disappearance of signs and symptoms of myeloma) and do not survive as long as participants with low-risk myeloma. Researchers at MIRT think that one reason for this is that the myeloma cells re-grow in the time when participants are not receiving treatment because they are recovering from high-dose chemotherapy. In this study, participants will receive several chemotherapy drugs previously shown to be effective in myeloma, but in lower doses and in shorter cycles. It is hoped that by giving the drugs in this way, myeloma cells will not have time to re-grow between cycles, therefore resulting in longer remissions. This study is being done in an attempt to improve the remission rate and the survival time for participants with high-risk myeloma."
"NCT00870779","Brain Tumors","Fluorescence Guided Resection of Brain Tumors","Completed","United States","20395672","5-ALA","Drug","Removing a tumor from your brain is hard to do because, very often, brain tumors do not have boundaries that are easy for your surgeon to find. In many cases, the surgeon can't tell exactly where the tumor begins or ends. The surgeon usually can remove most of your tumor by looking at the MRI images that were taken of your brain before surgery. However, the surgeon does not have any good way to tell if the entire tumor has been removed or not. Removing the entire tumor is very important because leaving tumor behind may allow it to grow back which could decrease your chances of survival.

It is possible to detect tumor cells by making them glow with a specific color of light (a process called fluorescence). This can be done by having you take the drug, ALA, before your surgery. ALA is a molecule that already exists in the cells of your body. Once enough of it is in your body, it gets converted into another molecule named PpIX. If blue light is shined on a tumor that has enough PpIX, it will glow with red light (fluorescence) that can be detected with a special camera. In this study, we want to determine how the fluorescence (red light) is related to the tumor which appears in the images that are normally taken of your brain (which the surgeon uses to guide the removal of your tumor) and the tumor tissue that will be removed during your surgery. Removing the entire tumor is very important because leaving tumor behind may allow it to grow back which could decrease your chances of survival."

The purpose of this study is to see if the investigators can use genetic differences between patients to select the right drug to use with radiation therapy. This type of genetic testing is called pharmacogenetics.

Currently there are two drugs used to treat head and neck cancer that have provided a benefit when given with radiation compared to radiation alone in previous studies. These two drugs are cisplatin and cetuximab (Erbitux).

In this trial, the investigators will test whether genetic differences between patients can be used to pick which drug they should receive. A recent study that looked back to see how well patients with head and neck cancer responded to treatment with cisplatin showed that genetic differences in a few genes were associated with who did and who did not survive their cancer. The investigators are taking that finding and using it to test patients for these genetic differences to determine whether they should receive cisplatin or cetuximab. In other words, the investigators are trying to take what is essentially a flip of the coin choice between these two drugs, and instead use individual patient's genetic differences to make-and hopefully improve- this choice."

Furthermore, in cancer patients, cells collected via apheresis using Plerixafor and G-CSF have been successfully transplanted. In December 2008, Plerixafor received approval from the Food and Drug administration for use in combination with G-CSF to aid in mobilization of progenitor cells for apheresis. The proposed study is not designed to support approval of a new indication or change in the advertising for Plerixafor. The route of administration and dosage level are identical to that which is listed on the package insert. Although Plerixafor is not approved for patients with Hodgkins Lymphoma, there is no known or theoretic increased risk of the use of this drug in this patient population.

The study hypothesis for this study is that patients with a circulating CD34+ count < 20 cells/ul after 5 days of mobilization with G-CSF alone will achieve > or equal to 2 X 10(6)CD34+ cells/kg within 3 days of apheresis after receiving Plerixafor with G-CSF."

Because there is no standard treatment for the patients cancer at this time or because the currently used treatments do not work fully in all cases, patients are being asked to volunteer to take part in a gene transfer research study using special immune cells. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from diseases caused by germs or toxic substances. They work by binding those germs or substances, which stops them from growing or exerting their toxic effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected with germs. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers: they both have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. We have found from previous research that we can put a new gene into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. We now want to see if we can put a new gene in these cells that will let the T cells recognize and kill sarcoma cells. The new gene that we will put in makes an antibody specific for HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) that binds to sarcoma cells. In addition it contains CD28, which stimulated T cells and make them last longer. In other clinical studies using T cells, some investigators found that giving chemotherapy before the T cell infusion can improve the amount of time the T cells stay in the body and therefore the effect the T cells can have. Giving chemotherapy before a T cell infusion is called lymphodepletion since the chemotherapy is specifically chosen to decrease the number of lymphocytes in the body. Decreasing the number of patient's lymphocytes first should allow the T cells we infuse to expand and stay longer in your body, and potentially kill cancer cells more effectively. We will use fludarabine or the combination of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine as the chemotherapy agents for lymphodepletion. Cyclophosphamide and fludarabine are the chemotherapy agents most commonly used for lymphodepletion in immunotherapy clinical trials. The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of chimeric T cells, and to see whether this therapy might help patients with sarcoma. Another purpose is to see if it is safe to give HER2-CD28 T cells after lymphodepleting chemotherapy."

Letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor (which blocks an enzyme that produces estrogen), is a drug that is FDA approved. It has been shown to reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence in postmenopausal women with breast cancer who have been previously treated with tamoxifen. Letrozole works by stopping the production of estrogen in parts of the body other than the ovaries. Leuprolide is a drug that stops a women's ovarian cycles. This process is known as ovarian function suppression. Stopping a women's menstrual cycle may be effective against breast cancer for some patients when given as initial therapy. The combination of letrozole and leuprolide is considered a standard treatment for women with metastatic breast cancer, and is also sometimes used for treatment of premenopausal early stage breast cancer, but it has not been accepted as a standard of care treatment."

Substantial preclinical antitumor synergy supports the exploration of the combination of antiangiogenic compounds (including sunitinib and bevacizumab) plus ixabepilone. In Vivo, synergistic activity between ixabepilone and bevacizumab has been demonstrated using the 151-B human renal carcinoma xenograft model and this synergy compares favorably with other antiangiogenic inhibitors (i.e. sunitinib).
Combination therapies of bevacizumab with chemotherapy demonstrated improved benefit compared with single-agent cytotoxics in multiple animal models and in humans.
Clinical activity of both compounds used as single agents has been demonstrated in a broad spectrum of solid tumors. Bevacizumab and ixabepilone, when used as a single agent, have demonstrated substantial activity in renal cell carcinoma.
Phase II studies with bevacizumab and ixabepilone suggest the absence of overlapping toxicities.
Development of a well-tolerated and active bevacizumab/ixabepilone combination has the potential to further improve the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), and could represent a second-line option after sunitinib or sorafenib are no longer of benefit or are intolerable.

Primary Objectives:

Determine the objective response rate of the combination of ixabepilone and bevacizumab in patients with relapsed or refractory mRCC.
Determine progression-free survival.
Characterize the toxicity of the combination of ixabepilone and bevacizumab in patients with mRCC.
Determine changes in biomarkers and evaluate correlation with clinical outcomes.

Eligibility:

Pathologic confirmation of renal cell carcinoma (clear cell histology) by the Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute (NCI), or the Medical University of South Carolina.
Presence of metastatic renal carcinoma, after progression or intolerance to Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors (sunitinib and/or sorafenib).
Adequate organ and bone marrow function.

Design:

Multi-center, open labeled phase II study
Following a Simon two-stage optimal design, a maximum of 58 patients with metastatic RCC will be accrued.
Ixabepilone will be administered daily as a one hour infusion on five successive days (daily x 5), every three weeks (one cycle equals 3 weeks or 21 days +/- 5 days). Following cycle 6, cycles will be spread out to 4 weeks or 28 days +/- 5 days. The starting dose will be a daily dose of 6 mg/m(2)/day, for a total per cycle dose of 30 mg/m(2).
In addition, 15 mg/kg bevacizumab will be administered intravenously on day 1 of each cycle. The first infusion of bevacizumab will be 90 minutes in duration, the second 60 minutes in duration, and in all subsequent cycles bevacizumab will be infused over 30 minutes if prior infusions are well tolerated."

Melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells (MART-1) and gp100 are two genes found in melanoma cells. An experimental procedure developed for treating patients with advanced melanoma uses these genes and a type of virus to make special cells called anti-MART-1 and anti-gp100 cells, which are designed to destroy the patient's tumor. The cells are created in the laboratory using the patient's own tumor cells or blood cells.
The procedure also uses one of two vaccines-the anti-MART-1 peptide or the anti-gp100 peptide-to stimulate cells in the immune system that may increase the effectiveness of the anti-MART-1 and anti-gp100 cells. Both vaccines are made from a virus that is modified to carry a copy of the MART-1 gene or gp100 gene. The virus cannot cause disease in humans.

Objectives:

- To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of anti-MART-1 and anti-gp100 cells and peptide vaccines for treating patients with advanced melanoma.

Eligibility:

- Patients 18 years of age with metastatic melanoma for whom standard treatments, including aldesleukin (IL-2) therapy to boost immune response, have not been effective.

Design:

Participants have an initial evaluation with complete medical history, as well as scans, x-rays, and other tests as directed by researchers. Most of the treatments for this study will be given on an inpatient basis.
Before the treatment begins, participants will undergo leukapheresis (removal of selected blood cells) to obtain cells for preparing the anti-MART-1 and anti-gp100 cells, and for later stem cell transplantation.
Preinfusion treatment: 5 days of chemotherapy and 2 days of total-body irradiation to prepare the immune system for receiving the anti-MART-1 and anti-gp100 cells.
Infusion of cells, followed by IL-2 treatment to improve immune response. IL-2 is given as a 15-minute infusion through a vein every 8 hours for a maximum of 15 doses (over 5 days).
After the cell infusion, participants will be divided into two groups and will receive either the gp100 peptide or MART-1 vaccine, given once a week for 3 weeks. Participants will also have stem cell transplantation (from previously collected stem cells) to promote cell survival.
Periodic follow-up clinic visits after hospital discharge for physical examination, review of treatment side effects, laboratory tests and scans every 1 to 6 months."

Low-dose chemotherapy is easier for the body to tolerate than typical high-dose chemotherapy and involves a shorter period of complete immune suppression.

Donor immune cells called lymphocytes, or T cells, fight residual tumor cells that might have remained in the recipients body after stem cell transplant, in what is called a graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect.

The immune-suppressing drug sirolimus appears to help prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a side effect of stem cell transplant in which donated T cells sometimes attack healthy tissues, damaging organs such as the liver, intestines and skin.

Th2 cells are cells collected from the transplant donor and grown in a high concentration of sirolimus.

Objectives:

To determine whether stem cell transplantation using low-dose chemotherapy and sirolimus-generated Th2 cells can cause a remission of advanced kidney cancer.

Eligibility:

Patients between 18 and 75 years of age who have kidney cancer that has spread beyond the kidney and who have a tissue-matched sibling stem cell donor.

Design:

Patients undergo stem cell transplantation as follows:

Low-intensity chemotherapy with pentostatin and cyclophosphamide over a 21-day period to reduce the level of the immune system to prepare for the transplant. Pentostatin is given through a vein (intravenous (IV)) on days 1, 8 and 15; cyclophosphamide tablets are taken by mouth for 21 consecutive days.
Sirolimus tablets, taken by mouth, starting 2 days before the transplant and continuing until 60 days after the transplant.
IV infusions of stem cells and Th2 cells.

Following the transplant, patients have the following procedures:

Additional Th2 cell infusions on days 14 and 45 after the transplant.
Follow-up visits at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center twice a week for the first 6 months after the transplant and then less frequently for at least 5 years to evaluate response to treatment and treatment side effects. Evaluations include a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy 1 month after transplant and periodic blood tests and imaging procedures (e.g., computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans)."

Primary Objective:

Determine if radiation induced xerostomia (RIX) increases the frequency or duration of acid-reflux when re-measured approximately 6-12 weeks after RT (measured by # episodes, their duration, and Reflux Area Index (RAI). Reflux Area (RA) is the sum of the area under the curve for all episodes of pH<4 recorded during the study in units of Ph*minutes. The Reflux area index (RAI) is the RA corrected for the duration of the study (RA x 100/study duration).

Secondary Objectives:

To demonstrate that patients undergoing RT for OPC have reflux into the irradiated field that is anticipated to exacerbate mucositis symptoms
Correlate RAI and # episodes of acid reflux with salivary flow before and after RT to determine if radiation induced hyposalivation is associated with more reflux events and symptoms.
For patients with no pre-RT pathologic acid reflux, determine if RIX leads to conversion to acid-positive reflux measured approximately 6-12 weeks after RT.

Gene transfer involves drawing blood from the patient, and then separating out the T-cells using a machine. Researchers then perform a gene transfer to change the T-cells' DNA, and then inject the changed T-cells into the body of the patient.

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if an investigational type of gene transfer can be given reliably and safely in patients with advanced B-cell lymphoma. B cells are a type of white blood cell that fights infection and disease. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the immune system, including B cells.

The gene transfer involves drawing blood, separating out T cells (white blood cells that fight infection and disease), changing the T cells' DNA (genetic material) in a specific way, and returning the changed T cells back to the body.

Researchers want to learn the highest dose of the changed T cells that can be given safely. Researchers also want to learn how long the changed T cells remain in the participant's body, and if the changed T cells can reliably treat B-cell lymphoma. Finally, researchers want to learn if interleukin-2 (IL-2) can help the changed T cells last longer in the body."

This monoclonal antibody has been specifically made to block Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA4), which is a protein found on cells of the immune system. CTLA4 seems to slow down the immune response, so blocking it with an anti-CTLA4 antibody may make the immune response more active. The purpose of this study is to see if Ipilimumab affects the response of the patient's immune system toward their cancer."

Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving these treatments before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy and radiation therapy are more effective when given with or without panitumumab in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

This is because estrogen use can lead to a breast cancer recurrence or a new primary breast cancer. It is unclear if the estrogen in Vagifem is only absorbed in the vagina. It may be absorbed into the blood stream for a short time and may cause a brief rise in your estrogen level. However, there is no clear evidence that this would cause any bad effects in patients with breast cancer. How much, if any, of these topical estrogens are absorbed through the vagina is not known.

It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells.

Using this successful paradigm, there has been a continued search for other targeted biologic therapies directed at receptors with known potential for promoting tumor growth.

The estrogen receptor (ER) and/or the HER signaling pathways are the dominant drivers of cell proliferation and survival in the majority of human breast cancers. Molecular targets of these pathways provide the most effective therapies in appropriately selected patients. However, de novo and acquired resistance remain major obstacles to successful treatment, and understanding the molecular pathways responsible for this resistance would enable the discovery of new strategies to overcome it.

The superiority of multi-drug HER2-targeted therapy over single agent therapy has been demonstrated in the preclinical setting using mouse xenografts. Trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib, and gefitinib, represent a group of therapeutic agents that target the HER family by different molecular mechanisms. Used as single agents in the MCF7/HER2-18 xenograft model, these drugs restored or enhanced sensitivity to tamoxifen. However, tumor growth inhibition lasted only 2-3 months before resistance to treatments occurred. However, when gefitinib, a HER1 inhibitor, was added to the two-antibody (T+P) regimen to block signals from HER1 dimers, a complete disappearance of nearly all xenograft tumors was observed; moreover, there was evidence of complete tumor eradication in 50% of the mice. The combination of lapatinib + trastuzumab was also highly effective in eradication of tumor burden, with no evidence of re-growth after 200 days. These xenograft models demonstrate that multi-drug HER2-targeted therapy more effectively induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation, thereby resulting in tumor regression. Furthermore, HER2 combination therapy appears to more effectively reduce levels of phosphorylated pAKT and MAPK, thus resulting in sustained tumor inhibition."

Bevacizumab is an antibody (a protein that attacks a foreign substance in the body) that is made in the laboratory. Bevacizumab works differently from the way chemotherapy drugs work. Usually chemotherapy drugs attack fast growing cancer cells in the body. Bevacizumab works to slow or stop the growth of cells in cancer tumors by decreasing the blood supply to the tumors. When the blood supply is decreased, the tumors don't get the oxygen and nutrients they need to grow. Carboplatin is in a class of drugs known as platinum-containing compounds and has been approved for use in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Information from other research studies suggests that the combination of bevacizumab with carboplatin may be effective in treating breast cancer."

ABT-888 works by obstructing a DNA enzyme called poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) which helps repair cancer cells damaged by chemotherapy. By blocking the PARP enzyme, the cancer cells are unable to repair themselves and as a result die. The other drug in this study is temozolomide. Temozolomide is designed to damage DNA in order to prevent cancer cells from reproducing. Because PARP inhibitors, such as ABT-888, prevent cancer cells from repairing their own DNA, they enhance the potential of chemotherapy therapy like temozolomide to induce cell death. The combination of ABT-888 and temozolomide has been used in a clinical trial for treatment of other cancers and information for this research study suggests that the combination may help to inhibit growth in breast cancer.

Determine the likelihood that lenalidomide will adequately control the disease for at least one year.

Lenalidomide is a drug that alters the immune system and it may also interfere with the development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. Therefore, in theory, it may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Lenalidomide is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of specific types of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in combination with dexamethasone for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least 1 prior therapy. MDS and MM are cancers of the blood. It is currently being tested in a variety of cancer conditions.

In this case it is considered experimental. The lenalidomide being administered in this study is not a commercially marketed product. Although it is expected to be very similar in safety and activity to the commercially marketed drug, it is possible that some differences may exist. Because this is not a commercially marketed drug, lenalidomide can only be administered to patients enrolled in this clinical trial and may only be administered under the direction of physicians who are investigators in this clinical trial."

A side effect of high chemotherapy doses is damage to the bone marrow where our blood and immune system cells are produced.

Stem cells (or progenitor cells) are the source of all blood cells. They are formed in the bone marrow (the spongy cavity in the center of large bones). The stem cells receive signals that direct them to become red cells, white cells or platelets. This happens before they are released into the blood stream. Stem cells circulating in the blood stream can be collected through a process called ""apheresis"" or ""stem cell collection"". The cells are then processed and frozen to preserve them. After chemotherapy has been given the stem cells are thawed and given back intravenously (IV: into the vein), like a blood transfusion. The stem cells in the collection will find their way back into the bone marrow space and, after a few days, will start to produce the blood and immune cells as they normally would. Having your own stem cells collected and returned to you later is called an ""autologous transplant.""

Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a disease in which malignant cancer cells form in the lymph system. Autologous stem cell transplantation is the standard of care for a chemo-sensitive relapse in patients with large cell lymphoma that has spread.

Bendamustine works by blocking the growth of cancer cells. It is used for the management of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and follicular lymphoma. Bendamustine in addition to rituximab (BR) is used in several trials in patients with lymphoma with encouraging results. Adequate peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection is a pre-requisite for high dose therapy followed by cell transplantation in patients with relapsed lymphoma. Exposure to previous multiple chemotherapy and radiation treatment may lead to poor mobilization of PBSC. It is not known whether pre-treatment with bendamustine will adversely affect the process of PBSC mobilization and harvest. On the other hand, it is assumed that high dose alkylating agents like cyclophosphamide may actually help in breaking the bond between stem cells and the stromal cells in the marrow cavity and hence may lead to a better mobilization of PBSC."

Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Chemoembolization kills tumor cells by blocking the blood flow to the tumor and keeping chemotherapy drugs near the tumor.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying side effects and best dose of sorafenib tosylate when given together with chemoembolization in treating patients with unresectable liver cancer."

After the MTD is established for each combination (Phase 2), subjects will be enrolled to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of these combinations in metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer. Both trastuzumab and paclitaxel are used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC), but patients can develop resistance.

The link between PI3K mutations and trastuzumab resistance has been seen in breast cancer patients. This suggests that inhibitors of the PI3K/PTEN pathway may have the potential to restore sensitivity to trastuzumab. Similarly, introduction of activated mutant forms of PI3K has been shown to transform and confer paclitaxel resistance to immortalized breast epithelial cells. XL147 is a potent and selective inhibitor of PI3K and inhibits phosphorylation of multiple downstream components of PI3K/PTEN signaling. Therefore, XL147 may have utility in the treatment of trastuzumab resistant/refractory and HER2-positive MBC when administered in combination with trastuzumab alone or with trastuzumab and paclitaxel."

RAD001 has been in clinical development since 1996 as an immunosuppressant in solid organ transplantation and has obtained marketing authorization (Certican®) for prophylaxis of rejection in renal and cardiac transplantation in a number of countries, including the majority of the European Union. RAD001 has been in development for patients with various malignancies since 2002.

RAD001 is being investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act:

Directly on the tumor cells by inhibiting tumor cell growth and proliferation
Indirectly by inhibiting angiogenesis leading to reduced tumor vascularity (via potent inhibition of tumor cell HIF-1 activity, VEGF production and VEGF-induced proliferation of endothelial cells). The role of angiogenesis in the maintenance of solid tumor growth is well established, and the mTOR pathway has been implicated in the regulation of tumor production of proangiogenic factors as well as modulation of VEGFR signaling in endothelial cells.

At weekly and daily schedules and at various doses explored, RAD001 is generally well tolerated. The most frequent adverse events (rash, mucositis, fatigue and headache) associated with RAD001 therapy are manageable. Non-infectious pneumonitis has been reported with mTOR inhibitors but is commonly low-grade and reversible.

Both FOLFOX and bevacizumab are well established for treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinomas. FOLFOX-6 can be combined safely with Bevacizumab and is currently in phase 3 testing for adjuvant therapy and is commonly used as a first line treatment regimen for metastatic colorectal cancers 25. There is an enhanced interest in development of more effective regimens for colorectal cancers. RAD001 is a mTOR inhibitor that has preclinical and clinical activity in colorectal cancers. RAD001 downregulates the mTOR pathway which can lead to direct antiproliferative effects as well as decreased production of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor. A combination of RAD001 at 10 mg per day in combination with Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks has been shown to be efficacious and safe. In another trial, RAD001 was shown to have many patients with stable disease and clearly needs to be given in combination therapy."

The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy (effectiveness) of a new combination of drugs, ABT-888 and temozolomide for patients with colorectal cancer. Temozolomide acts by damaging deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in rapidly dividing cells, in other words, cancer cells. ABT-888 inhibits an enzyme called ""PARP"" which helps to fix damaged DNA. By inhibiting this enzyme, ABT-888 prevents cancer cells from repairing the damage caused by the temozolomide, and will hopefully increase the killing of cancer cells, and decrease the tumors in the body.

Oral mucositis is caused when chemotherapy attacks and kills the rapidly-dividing cells in the oral mucous membranes. This condition feels like sunburn (or heartburn) on the mucous tissues, and often leads to sores in the mouth or on the tongue. This can cause discomfort, pain, difficulties in eating, and a longer hospital stay. Several therapies appear to either prevent or reduce the severity of mouth ulcers caused by chemotherapy for multiple myeloma. Different strategies are used to try and prevent this condition; a small number of trials found that some of these strategies may be effective. None of the trials had compared head to head the use of saline solution (our standard of care), cryotherapy (ice chips) and Caphosol in patients receiving high-dose melphalan.

The goal of this research study to evaluate the effectiveness of saline solution, cryotherapy, Caphosol for the prevention of oral mucositis in patients with multiple myeloma receiving high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

The researchers hope to learn if there are any differences among saline solution, cryotherapy and Caphosol mouth rinse for the prevention of oral mucositis."

"NCT01100619","Renal Cell Carcinoma","A Drug-Drug Interaction Study of the Effects of XL184 (Cabozantinib) on Rosiglitazone in Subjects With Solid Tumors","Completed","United States","20417723 / 20417723","Avandia / Avandia","Drug","The primary objective of this clinical study is to determine whether the inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozyme CYP2C8 by XL184 observed in in vitro preclinical studies translates into the potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions in humans. The study will measure the effect of once daily dosing of XL184 on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of rosiglitazone. The PK of XL184 when combined with rosiglitazone will be evaluated as well.

A specific objective of this study is to determine whether the interaction between XL184 and a drug such as rosiglitazone is sufficiently large enough to necessitate a dosage adjustment when used in combination with XL184, or whether the interaction would require additional therapeutic monitoring.

Rosiglitazone, commonly known as Avandia, is a prescription medicine approved by the FDA used to treat adults with Type 2 (adult-onset or non-insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus (high blood sugar). In this study, subjects will only take 2 doses of rosiglitazone. There is no intention of therapy as a result of taking rosiglitazone in this study."

Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of non-small cell lung cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Pemetrexed disodium may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether giving bevacizumab or pemetrexed disodium alone or in combination is more effective in treating non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.

It has been used in studies to map lymphatic pathways in lung and breast cancer and information from those studies suggest it may help identify lymph nodes associated with melanoma. ICG can be detected within the body using near-infrared light cameras.

In this study the investigators are looking at how easily ICG can get to the first lymph node (sentinel lymph node [SLN]) associated with melanoma, whether the investigators can see the path of the ICG and the SLN using a near infrared camera, and what dose of ICG works the best. While the current method for SNL mapping, known as lymphoscintigraphy, is effective it does provide a small amount of radiation.

Stem cells are very early blood cells. They have not yet matured to become red or white blood cells or platelets. They have already received the standard treatment of chemotherapy and an autologous stem cell transplant. An autologous stem cell transplant is when the patient receives their infusion of their own cells. Thi will give the patient a better chance of curing the disease, this protocol includes an infusion of stem cells from the blood (or the bone marrow) of another person. This is called an allogeneic stem cell transplant. The stem cells will begin to grow in the bone marrow and produce new blood cells.

Allogeneic stem cell transplants can cause a condition called graft-versus-host disease or GVHD. In GVHD, a kind of white blood cell from the donor (graft) begins to attack the body (host). That blood cell is called a T-cell. It is a cell that normally helps to protects against things like bacteria and viruses. In this case, the donor's T-cells see the body as foreign in the same way they would see bacteria as foreign. GVHD can be fatal. In order to lower the chance that the patient will get GVHD this protocol treatment will remove the T-cells from the donor's cells. This is called T-cell depletion. The T cells are removed by a system called ""Clinimacs"". This method is still being evaluated through clinical trials and not been approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) at this time.

Before the transplant, the physician will treat the bone marrow to get rid of the cancer. The physician uses three chemotherapy drugs plus ATG. The chemotherapy drugs (Busulfan, Melphalan and Fludarabine) kills the cancer. ATG gets rid of any of the patients T cells that survive the chemotherapy. This ensures that the donor stem cells are not rejected. The patient will also receive additional white blood cells called lymphocytes from the donor. This is called a donor lymphocyte infusion or DLI. These additional infusions will help cause a graft-versus-myeloma effect and can help the donor stem cells grow."

They have not been approved in the combination for multiple myeloma or any other type of cancer. Bortezomib is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide is approved for use with dexamethasone for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy and for the treatment of certain types of myelodysplastic syndrome (another type of cancer affecting the blood). Dexamethasone is commonly used, either alone, or in combination with other drugs, to treat multiple myeloma. Please note that Bortezomib and Lenalidomide are provided to patients participating in this trial at no charge. Melphalan and cyclophosphamide, the drugs used during stem cell collection and transplant, are also approved by the FDA. Melphalan is an FDA-approved chemotherapy for multiple myeloma and is used as a high-dose conditioning treatment prior to stem cell transplantation. Cyclophosphamide is used, either alone, or in combination with other drugs, to treat multiple myeloma. These drugs have been used in other multiple myeloma studies and information from those studies suggests that this combination of therapy may help to treat newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

In this research study, we are looking to explore the drug combination, lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone alone or when combined with autologous stem cell transplantation to see what side effects it may have and how well it works for treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Specifically, the objective of this trial is to determine if, in the era of novel drugs, high dose therapy (HDT) is still necessary in the initial management of multiple myeloma in younger patients. In this study, HDT as compared to conventional dose treatment would be considered superior if it significantly prolongs progression-free survival by at least 9 months or more, recognizing that particular subgroups may benefit more compared to others."

Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. It is not yet known whether giving bendamustine hydrochloride and rituximab together alone is more effective than giving bendamustine hydrochloride and rituximab together with bortezomib or lenalidomide in treating follicular lymphoma.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying giving bendamustine hydrochloride and rituximab together with or without bortezomib followed by rituximab with or without lenalidomide to see how well they work in treating patients with high-risk stage II, stage III, or stage IV follicular lymphoma."

This is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Chemotherapy is used to shrink the tumor before surgery, which sometimes may allow for a smaller portion of the breast to be removed. Receiving chemotherapy before surgery may sometimes also allow for smaller portions of the breast to be removed. Getting chemotherapy prior to surgery may also control any hidden metastatic disease and thereby decrease the risk of cancer relapse. Pre-surgery chemotherapy is a standard management approach for locally advanced breast cancer.

Different combinations of drugs can be used as part of the pre-surgery chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to determine if using a chemotherapy regimen of TC is effective way to manage locally advanced breast cancer (Stage IIA- IIIB) when the TC is given before surgery. The investigators also hope this study will help us to better understand how the tumor tissue is affected by this combination of chemotherapy drugs.

The TC drug combination is FDA approved for use in treating breast cancer, and it has been shown to be equally effective as other commonly used chemotherapy regimens when used after surgery; but, the TC drug combination has not yet been studied in conjunction with NAC for use before surgery. The investigators will be studying the combination of TC used before surgery as a means of possibly shrinking the tumor."

GAs are also designed to help the health care team understand how well subjects can carry out their day to day activities and to briefly describe what other medical conditions subjects may have. This assessment will help the health care team understand a subject's ""functional age"" (the age a subject functions at) as compared to a subject's actual age.

The researchers also want to learn how chemotherapy affects the aging process in our bodies. This is done by measuring the amount of p16 in blood. Researchers want to understand if chemotherapy changes the levels of p16 in blood."

- The experimental cancer treatment drug ABT-888 (Veliparib) works by preventing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair in tumor cells. Cyclophosphamide is a cancer treatment drug that works by causing DNA damage in cells, including cancer cells, resulting in cell death. However, because cyclophosphamide has strong and unpleasant side effects, researchers are interested in finding drugs that can be given in combination with cyclophosphamide that will allow a lower dose of cyclophosphamide to be given with similar effects. The combination of ABT-88 and cyclophosphamide may be an effective treatment for some types of cancer, such as certain kinds of breast or ovarian cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that often do not respond to standard therapies.

Objectives:

- To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ABT-888 and cyclophosphamide in ovarian and breast cancer and in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that have not responded to standard treatments.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with (1) (Breast cancer 1/2) BRCA1/2 ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal or ovarian high-grade carcinoma, or fallopian tube cancer; (2) triple-negative breast cancer (not responsive to hormone-related therapy); or (3) low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Design:

Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, and tumor imaging studies. Participants will be divided into two groups with different treatment subgroups.
Group 1: Participants who have BRCA-positive ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal or ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma, or fallopian tube cancer
Participants will receive either the combination of ABT-888 and cyclophosphamide, or cyclophosphamide alone.
Participants will take the study drug by mouth once a day for 21-day cycles of treatment, and will keep a diary to record drug doses and any side effects.
Participants will have clinic visits with blood and urine tests, imaging studies, and other examinations on days 1, 2, 7, and 14 of cycle 1, and on the first day of all other cycles.
Group 2: Participants who have triple-negative breast cancer or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
Participants will receive either the combination of ABT-888 and cyclophosphamide, or cyclophosphamide alone.
Participants will take the study drug by mouth once a day for 21-day cycles of treatment, and will keep a diary to record drug doses and any side effects.
Participants will have clinic visits with blood and urine tests, imaging studies, and other examinations on days 1, 2, 7, and 14 of cycle 1, and on the first day of all other cycles.
Participants receiving only cyclophosphamide who show signs of disease progression after tumor imaging studies can receive the combination of ABT-888 with cyclophosphamide.
Treatment will continue as long as participants tolerate the drugs and the disease does not progress."

Metastatic disease including metastatic breast cancer unfortunately remains incurable. One reason is due to the inability to develop specific therapies for specific cancer subsets.

The use of modern genomic techniques has significantly enhanced our recent understanding of breast cancer biology. Five distinct breast cancer subsets have been recognized, one of which is basal-like breast cancer. Basal-like breast cancer is typically estrogen receptor (ER) negative, progesterone receptor (PR) negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2-Neu) negative. This is referred to as triple negative breast cancer or TBNC. TBNC represents a significant proportion of breast cancer patients (10-20%) and has a poor prognosis with no targeted approach to therapy as of yet.

Tigatuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting a death receptor on the breast cancer cells. Previous studies have shown that combining antibodies with selected chemotherapy agents have induced tumor cell death. The hypothesis of this study is to use tigatuzumab and combine it with Abraxane to serve as a targeting agent in metastatic TBNC patients."

The closely related compound, Pomalidomide, may have clinical activity in patients who have previously been treated with lenalidomide and who no longer respond to it. The mechanism of anti-tumor effects of these drugs has been attributed to several effects including anti-angiogenesis, immune activation, and anti-proliferative effects. Recent studies have suggested that these agents can mediate surprisingly rapid biologic effects on human monocytes and T cells. Our hypothesis is that the proximate effects of these drugs will be sensitive and quantitative surrogates of subsequent effects including activation of tumor antigen specific T cells as well as innate immune cells. Understanding the correlation between the pharmacodynamics of these effects with downstream activation using quantitative assays will facilitate the rational development of pomalidomide as immune-modulatory drug in diverse settings as well as its optimal development in myeloma therapy."

Typically, patients with these cancers receive a combination of cancer drugs (chemotherapy), surgery, or radiation therapy. These treatments can prolong their life but may not offer a long-term cure.

This study proposes using a drug called Sirolimus in combination with common chemotherapy drugs to treat patients with recurrent and refractory solid tumors. Sirolimus has been found to inhibit cell growth and to have anti-tumor activity in pediatric solid tumors in previous studies and, therefore, has the potential to increase the effectiveness of the chemotherapy drugs when given together.

This study wil investigate the highest dose of Sirolimus that can be given orally with other oral chemotherapy drugs. Cohorts of 2 subjects will be started at the minimum dose. The dose will be increased in the next 2 subjects as long as there were no major reactions in the previous groups. This study will also seek to learn more about the side effects of sirolimus when used in this combination and what effects the drug has on the white cells and the immune system. Successful use of this drug will impact the cancer population greatly by providing an increased chance of survival to those with resistant or recurrent cancers."

In those studies of patients with cancer but not diabetes, glucose (or sugar) levels in the blood are generally no lowered. Insulin and insulin-like growth factors affect the growth of cancer cells.

This randomized study will compare different interventions; exercise, exercise and metformin, metformin alone, or a control arm. The investigators are not directly testing how either exercise or metformin affects your disease. The investigators are testing how they affect insulin levels in your body as well as other blood markers. The investigators believe that these blood tests may either be related to cancer recurrences or be an early sign of cancer recurrences and they are testing how both exercise and metformin may change those markers."

Pemetrexed disodium may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of non-small cell lung cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving carboplatin and pemetrexed disodium together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving carboplatin and pemetrexed disodium together with bevacizumab works in treating patients with stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer who are light or never smokers."

The development of new treatment strategies is essential to improve outcome for patients with metastatic breast cancer

There is significant preclinical and clinical evidence indicating that creating new blood vessels (neoangiogenesis) to provide nutrients to solid tumors, including breast cancer, provides the necessary conditions to allow tumor growth. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the important molecules regulating new blood vessel formations and subsequent invasion and metastases. As a result, agents that inhibit VEGF are of substantial interest for the treatment of advanced diseases.

Different types of chemotherapeutic treatments are used that target different parts of the cancer cell with some success, but there is room for other treatment options.

It is known that people with cancer are using high doses of intravenous vitamin C also known as ascorbate, as a cancer treatment and this is occurring frequently. When Vitamin C is given in this manner, it is not taken by mouth; instead, it enters your body through an IV (intravenous) site, or tube that is inserted through a needle into your vein. If you have a port-a-cath in place, the IV will be given using your port. When Vitamin C enters your body through an IV site, it is known that it acts like a drug and not a vitamin. It produces a substance around the cancer cells called hydrogen peroxide. It has been seen in animal research studies that hydrogen peroxide kills the cancer cells while leaving the normal cells unharmed.

The investigators propose to use the need for dose reduction as a criterion to judge tolerability from various causes. In the veteran population which predominantly is in the older age category with number of co-morbidities, a lower dose regimen may be safer and advantageous.

This study expects to enroll approximately 80 subjects from participating VA sites across the nation.

The investigators will evaluate the safety of the two dose regimens by comparing frequency of dose reductions. The investigators will also measure how long the responses last with each dose.

Lenalidomide is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of specific types of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in combination with dexamethasone for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least 1 prior therapy. MDS and MM are cancers of the blood. It is currently being tested in a variety of cancer conditions. In this case it is considered experimental.

At the time of enrollment, one-half of the subjects will be chosen at random to receive the 15 mg Lenalidomide dose and the other half will take the 25 mg dose regimen of Lenalidomide. Depending on lenalidomide treatment assignment, subjects will receive either 15 mg p.o. q.d. or 25 mg p.o. q.d. for days 1-21 of a 28 day cycle. In addition, dexamethasone (40 mg) will be added once a week (Days 1, 8, 15 and 22) to the Lenalidomide regimen, with a dose reduction on the same schedule if the patient cannot tolerate the higher dose of dexamethasone. ASA (81 or 325mg) will be given daily for anticoagulation prophylaxis. Patients intolerant to ASA may use low molecular weight heparin. Lovenox is recommended.

Some find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Others interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as methotrexate, vincristine sulfate, procarbazine hydrochloride, and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill cancer cells. It is not yet know whether rituximab and combination chemotherapy are more effective when given with or without radiation therapy in treating patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma.

- Carfilzomib is an experimental anti-cancer drug that has not yet been approved for treating multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide is a drug that may stop tumor growth and help the immune system kill cancer cells. Dexamethasone is a drug that helps stop inflammation. It is sometimes used to treat (alone or with other drugs) certain types of cancer, especially multiple myeloma. This combination of drugs has not been tested in people with multiple myeloma. Researchers want to see whether it is safe and effective for this group.

Objectives:

- To test the effectiveness of combined carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone in treating multiple myeloma.

Eligibility:

- People at least 18 years of age who have multiple myeloma that has not been treated.

Design:

Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also have blood and urine tests, a bone marrow sample, and molecular imaging studies.
Participants will have eight 28-day cycles of treatment. The combined study drugs will be given as tablets and injections. Those in the study will be monitored with frequent blood tests, bone marrow samples, and molecular imaging studies. In addition to current standard measures to determine clinical responses, molecular tests will be conducted to define evidence of minimal residual disease.
After the first four cycles of therapy, those who are eligible for a stem cell transplant will have stem cells collected and stored for use if the cancer returns.

After stem cell collection, participants will have the second four treatment cycles.

-, If the disease has improved or is stable at the end of eight cycles, those in the study may have another 12 cycles of low-dose (maintenance) lenalidomide alone.

Participants will have regular follow-up visits after the end of the study chemotherapy."

Two cord blood units (double cord blood) are being used, as the numbers of blood cells in one unit are too few to allow successful growth of these cells.

Because the risk of infection, particularly virus infection, is high after double cord blood transplant, this study seeks to reduce the rise of virus infection by using a reduced intensity regimen without a medicine called antithymocyte globulin (ATG), as used in prior cord blood transplants. Subjects will receive two chemotherapy drugs, melphalan and fludarabine, and low dose of total body radiation (one treatment) instead of the ATG.

To assess the efficacy of the combination of gemcitabine, taxotere, and xeloda (GTX) with cisplatin in subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer based on the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 month.

Secondary Objectives

To assess safety and characterize toxicities of the combination of GTX with cisplatin in subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
To estimate disease control rate (DCR), PFS, and overall survival (OS).
To estimate a PFS rate of an expansion cohort testing an alternative schedule.

Study Design

This study is a single arm phase II study to assess the efficacy of GTX with cisplatin in subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Approximately 38 evaluable subjects will be enrolled, 28 in the initial cohort and 10 in the expansion cohort

The study will have a safety run-in phase consisting of 6 subjects. To ensure that the combination is safe, the first six subjects will be treated at DL1 and observed for limiting toxicity for the first 2 cycles before continuation with further accrual. After the safety run-in, the study will be continuously monitored for adverse events.

The primary endpoint will be the PFS rate at 6 month, which is defined as the proportion of subjects alive, free of disease progression at 6 months. The treatment regimen would be considered of insufficient activity for further study in this population if PFS rate at 6 months is 50% or less, and the minimum required level of efficacy that would warrant further study with the proposed regimen is a 75% PFS rate at 6 months. The study design includes interim monitoring for futility using a predictive probability approach. We will stop the study early if given the information at the interim analysis, it is unlikely that the PFS rate at 6 months will be greater than 50% if the study continues to the end."

Although surgery, in combination with other modalities like radiation therapy can achieve 40-50% five year survival rates, resection in the head and neck region can leave patients with poor functional and cosmetic outcomes.

Due to these concerns about quality of life after surgery, there has been a lot of interest in non surgical alternatives of treatment. Various combinations of radiation, chemotherapy and biologics has showed promising results. However, questions still remain about the ideal combination treatment regimen.

Based on assimilation of data from multiple sources, our study tries to identify the role of a potentially highly effective multi-modality regimen based on induction chemotherapy (Cisplatin, Docetaxel and 5 Fluorouracil) followed by combination of a biologic agent, Cetuximab, and radiation therapy."

Researchers also want to learn if this can help to control the disease.

The cord blood will be changed to make use of sugar that is found in small amounts in blood cells. It plays a role in signaling where in the body the transplanted cells should go to. Adding more sugars to the cord blood cells in the laboratory is designed to help the cord blood cells find their way faster to the bone marrow. This may help your blood counts to recover faster. This process is called fucosylation.

Because RAD001 has not been used in this combination before, it is not clear which dose will be best when used in combination.

The standard of care for patients who have esophageal cancer that has not moved to other areas of the body (non-metastatic) includes a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy and possibly surgery. If the patient chooses to participate in this study, the patient will receive chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The patient will possibly also have surgery to have the cancer removed. This decision will be made by the treating physicians. All of the chemotherapy the patient will receive on the study is considered standard chemotherapy for esophagus cancer.

Although most NHLs respond to currently available therapies, the majority of patients relapse and many never have a complete response to therapy. In the investigators attempts to further understand the pathogenesis of NHLs, the investigators have identified and characterized expression of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) at the DNA, RNA and protein levels in association with the presence of NHLs (and other neoplastic diseases). The investigators preclinical evidence suggests a correlation with the level of HERV-K (a particular family of HERVs) expression and NHL disease activity, leading us to hypothesize that HERV-K expression may contribute to the development of the disease and/or to its recurrence. If this hypothesis is correct, then drugs that inhibit HERV-K expression may prevent recurrence of disease and/or may provide a novel therapeutic approach for NHLs.

To test this hypothesis, the investigators eventually intend to study the use of anti-retroviral therapies in patients with NHL. The investigators in vitro studies have demonstrated that HERV-K expression decreases in response to the currently FDA-approved and available, anti-HIV drugs, Lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir). These medications are tolerated well in HIV patients, but it is unknown how the combination of Lamivudine and Tenofovir will be tolerated by patients with NHL. To further test the investigators hypotheses, the investigators propose the following Specific Aims of the current study: (1) To evaluate the tolerability, toxicity and safety of administering Lamivudine and Tenofovir in combination to patients with relapsed or refractory NHL; (2) To evaluate the effects of the combination of lamivudine and tenofovir on HERV-K plasma viral RNA load; and (3) To monitor the response rate of the NHL to treatment with the combination of lamivudine and tenofovir.

Fulvestrant is a hormonal therapy that works by attaching to estrogen receptors. In doing so, it can block the effect of estrogen on cancer cells. In addition, fulvestrant causes a decrease in the number of estrogen receptors. Fulvestrant is a drug that is approved by the FDA for treatment of metastatic, hormone receptor positive breast cancer, based upon the results of phase III clinical trials.

In the laboratory, adding ganetespib to fulvestrant appears to improve its effectiveness. It is not known whether this is true in humans.

Multiple myeloma is a blood cancer that affects the plasma cells. These cells help produce antibodies and fight infection. Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is a related condition that may develop into multiple myeloma. The current standard of care for SMM is close follow-up without treatment until multiple myeloma develops. However, researchers are studying possible treatments for SMM itself. One possible treatment involves a combination of cancer treatment drugs.
Lenalidomide is a drug that may help reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Dexamethasone is a steroid that is often given with other anti-cancer drugs. These two drugs are an approved treatment for multiple myeloma that has not responded to at least one other treatment. Carfilzomib is an experimental drug that has been effective in treating multiple myeloma. Researchers want to combine these three drugs to see if they are a safe and effective treatment for SMM.

Objectives:

- To see if carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone are a safe and effective treatment for smoldering multiple myeloma.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have SMM that is likely to progress to multiple myeloma.

Design:

Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also have blood and urine tests, and baseline bone marrow scans. Bone marrow samples will also be collected.
Participants will have eight 28-day cycles of treatment with the three study drugs. The drugs will be given as tablets or as infusions. Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and study visits.
After the first four cycles, participants who are eligible for a stem cell transplant will have their stem cells collected and stored for future use.
At the end of eight cycles, participants whose disease has not progressed will have up to 12 more cycles of treatment with lenalidomide tablets alone."

Proton beam radiation therapy is an FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) approved radiation delivery system.

Proton beam radiation therapy is known to spare surrounding normal tissues from radiation as it delivers less radiation beyond the area of the target tissues. This may reduce side effects that patients would normally experience with standard (photon) radiation therapy, which tends to include more normal tissue along with tumor target tissue.

Researchers in the laboratory have discovered that there are pathways inside the cells that can lead to growth and survival of the tumor. The chemotherapy drugs FOLFIRINOX and capecitabine are targeted towards blocking the pathways that allow cancer cells to divide, and may result in the tumor shrinking in size.

In this research study, the investigators are looking to determine if proton beam radiation in combination with FOLFIRINOX and capecitabine is effective in controlling the growth of your cancer."

Among women who elect to pursue breast reconstruction, approximately 75% will choose prosthetic breast reconstruction. Implant-based breast reconstruction is frequently achieved in two-stages. The first stage consists of the placement of a tissue expander after mastectomy. This is followed by a period of biweekly tissue expansions that can last several months. In the second stage, the tissue expander is removed in a surgical procedure and replaced with a permanent breast implant. Tissue expansion is a well-established breast reconstruction technique characterized by high success rates and high patient satisfaction. Despite the well-recognized advantages of this successful breast reconstruction technique, the subpectoral placement of a tissue expander is associated with significant pain and discomfort in the immediate post-operative period and during the phase of tissue expansion. Pectoralis major muscle spasm is a frequently reported problem during tissue expansion. Legeby et al. recently showed that women who underwent prosthetic breast reconstruction had higher pain scores and took more analgesics that those who did not choose post-mastectomy reconstruction.

In the past 10 years, publications on the use of botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) for pain relief in a wide array of clinical conditions have increased tremendously. BTX-A is one of the neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. By reversibly inhibiting neurotransmitter release, BTX-A has both analgesic and paralytic properties. The analgesic action of BTX-A was initially thought to be related to its effects on muscular contraction. However, a recent in vitro study of embryonic rat dorsal neurons did confirm that BTX-A inhibits release of substance P, a neurotransmitter associated with pain and inflammatory reactions. The presence of analgesic properties of BTX-A is increasingly supported by several clinical observations: pain relief with BTX-A injections has been reported for migraine headaches, chronic pelvic, chronic tennis elbow, and post-operative pain control for lower limb lengthening correction, among others.

This aspect has never been studied in breast cancer survivors who elect to pursue breast reconstruction with tissue expanders. Furthermore, physical function outcomes are important to consider with BTX-A use because the link between temporary muscle paralysis and improvements in participation in daily activities is not a given.

Pazopanib is a novel agent has recently been approved for the treatment of subjects with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and preclinical studies suggest it may be effective in other cancers such as ovarian cancer. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to test the efficacy and safety of a novel agent, pazopanib, as an adjunct to a standard treatment, gemcitabine, for recurrent or persistent ovarian cancer. This is an open label study in which subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive 4 cycles of either gemcitabine, or gemcitabine with pazopanib. Gemcitabine will be administered as an IV infusion weekly on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle. Subjects randomized to receive pazopanib will take 800 mg daily during the 21 day cycle.

"NCT01612728","Breast Cancer","Treatment for Joint Pains Due to Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy in Breast Cancer","Withdrawn","United States","19802066","Aromatase Inhibitor","Drug","Aromatase inhibitors are the most effective adjuvant anti-hormonal therapy for estrogen receptor positive (ER+) post-menopausal breast cancer patients, with proven superiority over tamoxifen in terms of disease-free survival, time to recurrence, and contralateral breast cancer. However, approximately half of the women who take this drug will develop significant joint pains, termed Aromatase Inhibitor-Induced Arthralgia (AIA). Though this medicine should be taken for 5 years, the joint pain can be so troublesome that up to 13% may prematurely discontinue it because of the arthralgia, thus sacrificing their best chance of recurrence-free survival. Nonetheless, neither the etiology nor optimal management of AIA is clearly understood, leaving both doctor and patient rather frustrated.

The investigators therefore propose to test the hypothesis that AIA can be effectively treated by a new clinical algorithm, and that effective treatment of the problem will lead to improved compliance with Aromatase Inhibitor (AI) therapy. The algorithm is a clinical pathway for treating AIA which incorporates, in a rational and step-wise manner, a series of interventions based on the available evidence. Interventions include acupuncture, pain medication, weight bearing exercise, and other commonly used therapies for AIA.

The investigators will enroll 100 women who are beginning adjuvant AI therapy and assess each woman's baseline joint pains via a questionnaire as well as grip strength measurement. The investigators will then periodically repeat these tests during AI therapy in order to systematically quantify and characterize AIA. Those women who develop AIA during the course of the study will be placed on the clinical algorithm, and the investigators will observe whether their joint pains significantly improve (as measured by questionnaire and grip strength measurement) after institution of the algorithm. The investigators will also determine whether their compliance is improved compared to historical controls, and at least non-inferior to the women in the study who do not develop AIA. Finally, the investigators will measure serum estrogen level at baseline and then periodically during AI therapy to investigate whether more dramatic decline in estrogen level after initiation of an AI leads to significant AIA and earlier time to onset.

This study targets a very common cause of pain among breast cancer survivors and aims to offer an effective treatment strategy to alleviate pain and improve quality of life as well as medication compliance."

The use of the FOLFIRINOX regimen is limited by its' intensity and toxicity. Previous protocol and clinical experience within the University of Michigan Pancreatic Program leads to an expectation of tolerance and efficacy of the proposed regimen. Advantages of the proposed regimen relative to FOLFIRINOX include:

Substitution of gemcitabine for irinotecan. Single agent activity of gemcitabine is at least as good as irinotecan (probably better, especially when delivered by FDR [fixed-dose rate] infusion) and gemcitabine is much better tolerated with less diarrhea, nausea/emesis, myelosuppression and alopecia.
Deletion of leucovorin infusion and 5FU bolus injection will lessen myelosuppression, mucositis and diarrhea.
Substitution of cisplatin for oxaliplatin will reduce cost of therapy and avoid cold aggravated dysesthesia.

Presuming evidence of efficacy and confirmation of tolerance with the proposed regimen, the investigators believe this treatment may be more widely applicable to pancreatic-biliary cancer patients, including those with advanced disease as well as being considered for use in locally advanced and neo- and adjuvant settings."

For patients who did not have a complete response after traditional chemotherapy, the chance is high that the tumor will return even after high-dose chemotherapy. To improve the response and decrease the chance of relapse, doctors have used rituximab, an antibody that kills lymphoma cells, both before and after transplantation. These doctors have reported that more patients had control of the tumor for an extended period of time using rituximab with high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation.

Although various treatment options are currently available for melanoma, melanomas that have metastasized widely to the skin pose a significant clinical challenge as the available therapies have limited effect. This study proposes the use of a topically applied compound named diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP) which has been shown to be effective in treating melanoma patients whose diseases have spread widely throughout the skin. DPCP works by having a patient's own immune system, which is usually used to fight infections, attack cancerous cells. This compound has commonly been used to treat other conditions such as warts and hair loss throughout the world for many years and is known to cause limited side effects. Altering a patient's own immune system through topical treatments has also been shown to benefit patients with other cancers that have metastasized to skin such as breast cancer. In this study, the investigators will use DPCP to treat cutaneous metastases of various cancers including melanoma. Our overall intention is to get a better understanding of effective immune responses in the skin that may mediate metastatic cancer regression or cure."

NSCLC tumor-secreted gp96-Ig is an ideal vaccine because it combines adjuvant activity with polyvalent peptide specificity. Tumor secreted gp96 activates dendritic cells (DC), natural killer cells (NK) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Tumor cells can be killed by NK-specific mechanisms, by promiscuous killing of CD8 CTL through NKG2D, and by MHC restricted CD8 CTL activity. The activation of DC and NK by tumor secreted gp96 may also counteract the generation of immuno-suppressive CD4 regulatory cells.

Suppression of adenosinergic pathways by oxygen and theophylline in combination with immunotherapy will improve tumor rejection.

These medications are fairly well tolerated, but can cause aches and pains which can be quite severe in some cases.

People experience pain differently. Estrogen appears to play a role in how we experience pain. Therefore, decreasing estrogen levels may lead to more pain in some women than others. The goal of this study is to evaluate perception of pain in women with breast cancer, and to determine if differences in pain perception lead to more aches and pains in some women treated with aromatase inhibitors.

In this study, we plan to enroll 55 women with breast cancer who are starting treatment with an aromatase inhibitor. Participants will undergo testing to evaluate their perception of pain, and will also complete a set of questionnaires. Testing will be conducted before starting aromatase inhibitor therapy, as well as after 3 and 6 months of therapy. We will investigate whether pre-existing differences in pain perception lead to different amounts of pain during aromatase inhibitor therapy."

""Investigational"" means that the combination of drugs is being studied. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved it for your type of cancer. Proton beam radiation therapy is an FDA approved radiation delivery system.

Conventional radiation therapy uses photons to treat cancer before patients undergo surgery to remove the tumor. In this study we are using radiation with protons, which spares surrounding tissue and organs from radiation. Proton radiation delivers radiation to the area requiring radiation with no dose beyond the treatment area. This may reduce side effects that patients would normally experience with conventional radiation therapy.

Researchers in the laboratory have discovered pathways inside cancer cells which contribute to the growth and survival of tumors. The FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy regimen is a combination of the drugs 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin. These chemotherapy drugs, along with the chemotherapy drug capecitabine, work by blocking these pathways and thereby preventing tumor growth. Capecitabine is FDA approved to be used alone or with other drugs to treat other types of advanced cancer, but not pancreatic cancer. In past research studies, FOLFIRINOX followed by radiation therapy with capecitabine has been identified as the most effective and active chemotherapy for patients with cancer that is spreading, and this is why we are using it to treat your type of cancer.

Losartan is classified as an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB), and is FDA approved for use in people with high blood pressure. Recent studies in people with different types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer, have shown that combining chemotherapy drugs with an ARB can help reduce/stop tumor growth more effectively than chemotherapy alone. Losartan has been used in previous research studies, and information from those research studies suggests that this drug in combination with FOLFIRINOX and capecitabine may be better at treating your type of cancer.

In this research study, we seek to determine whether combining FOLFIRINOX with Losartan before proton radiation therapy will be more efficient at controlling the growth of or shrinking your tumor than just FOLFIRINOX alone."

Currently, the mechanism of P-APS is unknown, and there is no standard of care to treat it. However, an intervention with both anti-inflammatory as well as neuroprotective properties would be an ideal candidate for testing in the prevention of P-APS and subsequent development of peripheral neuropathy. Previous studies have suggested that omega-3 fatty acids may act as neuroprotective agents, and there are no currently documented safety concerns with their combined use with paclitaxel.

Therefore, this randomized pilot clinical trial will determine whether omega-3 fatty acids can treat pain in patients with breast or ovarian cancer receiving paclitaxel."

The immune system needs to be ""trained"" to do this; the latter goal is accomplished by using a vaccine consisting of selected fragments of the target antigen, in this case, WT1.

This disease has been selected for this study because the WT1 protein is often present in myeloma cells. WT1 is a gene that is involved in the normal development of kidneys and other organs. When the WT1 gene becomes abnormal, it can make proteins involved in the development of cancer, i.e., can acquire the properties of a true ""oncogene"".

The study involves treatment with standard chemotherapy and a commonly used, FDA-approved, blood pressure drug called propranolol (Inderal). The purposes of this study are to:

Determine the effect of propranolol plus chemotherapy on breast cancer cells as well as the growth of blood vessels surrounding breast cancer cells.
Determine the side effect profile of propranolol and chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

This research is being done because previous laboratory work has shown that propranolol may decrease the ability for the blood vessels around breast cancer cells to grow, which may be important in helping cancer cells grow. It also may reduce the likelihood for breast cancer cells to spread. If changes are seen in the breast cancer cells and surrounding blood vessels in this study, we will pan to evaluate whether propranolol decreases the likelihood of breast cancer from recurring in future, later studies. All chemotherapy regimens used in this study have been the standard of care for many years; however, the use of propranolol is being researched along with the chemotherapy regimens."

Conventional radiation therapy has a limited role in the treatment of patients with liver metastases because the radiation doses are limited by liver toxicity. The CyberKnife system is a type of radiation machine that precisely focuses large doses of x-rays on the tumor, so that injury from radiation to the nearby normal tissue will be minimal. It is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat tumors, lesions and conditions anywhere in the body when radiation therapy is required. While the device is no longer classified as ""investigational"", the best treatment dose and times are still being evaluated.

Chemotherapy delivered with radiation therapy can increase the effectiveness of treatment, and may allow for a lower dose of radiation therapy to be utilized, thereby limiting negative side effects.

In this study, patients will receive Cyberknife radiosurgery directed to liver metastasis for 3-5 treatments, given every other day. Irinotecan 40mg/m2 will be administered intravenously daily for 3-5 days (5 treatments within 10 elapsed days), and prior to radiation therapy. Patients will have follow-up visits at months 1,2,4,6,9,12,15,18, 24, 30, 36, and every 6 months thereafter for 3 years."

- Tremelimumab is a cancer treatment drug that helps the immune system recognize and destroy cancer cells. Researchers want to see if it can be used to treat advanced liver cancer. The drug will be given with one of two types of treatment for liver cancer. The first type, transarterial catheter chemoembolization (TACE), injects chemotherapy drugs into the tumor through the main blood vessel that is feeding it. That blood vessel is then closed off to help keep the drugs in the tumor longer. The second type, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), uses a heated probe to destroy the tumor tissue. Researchers want to study how safe and effective these treatments are with the study drug.

Objectives:

- To test the safety and effectiveness of Tremelimumab with TACE or RFA for advanced liver cancer.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced liver cancer that has not responded to other treatments."

Phase II clinical trials test the effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. ""Investigational"" means that the drug is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating different types of cancer. It also means that the FDA has not approved this drug for use patients undergoing adjuvant treatment for HER2+ breast cancer. Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing. This drug has been used in other research studies and information from those other research studies suggests that this drug may help to prevent the recurrence of breast cancer in this research study.

The use of T-DM1 in this research study is experimental, which means it is not approved by any regulatory authority for the adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. However, it FDA-approved for metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. T-DM1 has caused cancer cells to die in laboratory studies. In preclinical studies, this drug has prevented or slowed the growth of breast cancer. The breast cancer treatments (paclitaxel and Trastuzumab) used in this study are considered part of standard-of-care regimens in early breast cancer. A standard treatment means that this is a treatment that would be accepted by the majority of the medical community as a suitable treatment for your type of breast cancer.

In this research study, the investigators are looking to see if the study drug T-DM1 will have less side effects than traditional HER2-positive breast cancer treatment of trastuzumab and paclitaxel. The investigators are also hoping to learn about the long term benefits and disease-free survival of participants who take the study drug T-DM1 in comparison to those participants to take the combination of trastuzumab and paclitaxel."
