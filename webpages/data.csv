"NCT00135200","Multiple Myeloma","Drug","Iodine I 131 Tositumomab","Active, not recruiting","United States","Clinical Trial of Consolidation Treatment With Iodine I 131 Tositumomab for Multiple Myeloma","This study is for patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed multiple myeloma. The main purpose of this study is to see how their disease responds to consolidation treatment (treatment aimed at further decreasing cancer cells) with a radioactive antibody (protein) called iodine I 131 tositumomab (known by the tradename Bexxar®) and also to look at the side effects which occur with this type of treatment. The investigators will also be looking at how long disease responds to treatment, if it responds at all, and how long patients who have had this treatment survive.

Bexxar is a monoclonal antibody (protein) to which radioactive iodine 131 is attached. The monoclonal antibody in Bexxar (tositumomab), targets a protein called CD20 found on the surface of a variety of B-cells, including lymphoma cells, and some myeloma cells. The antibody is given as an infusion and finds its way to these cells. The radioactive iodine attached to the antibody delivers radiation directly to these cells which works to harm or kill the cancer cells. Approximately 20-25% of patients with multiple myeloma have this protein on the surface of their tumor cells. In addition, this protein was found on the surface of myeloma stem cells. While myeloma stem cells represent a minority of all myeloma cells (less than 5%), these cells are resistant to chemotherapy and are believed to be responsible for a recurrence of the disease after chemotherapy. In this study, Bexxar will be used after patients complete a course of chemotherapy and have residual myeloma cells left in their body. The Investigators are hoping that the treatment with Bexxar will decrease and possibly eliminate residual myeloma cells resistant to chemotherapy.","2023-03-31"

"NCT00368082","Lymphoma","Biological","TGFbeta resistant LMP-specific CTLs","Active, not recruiting","United States","Autologous/Allogeneic TGFbeta-resistant LMP-specific CTL, Lymphoma (TGF-beta)","Patients have a type of lymph gland cancer called HD, NHL or lymphoepithelioma (these 3 diseases will be referred to as ""Lymphoma""). The lymphoma has come back or has not gone away after treatment. This is a research study using special immune system cells called TGFb-resistant LMP-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (DNR-CTL), a new experimental therapy.

Some patients with Lymphoma show signs of infection with the Epstein Barr virus (EBV) before or at the time of their Lymphoma diagnosis. EBV is found in the cancer cells of up to 1/2 the patients with Lymphoma, suggesting it may play a role in causing Lymphoma. The cancer cells infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system and escape being killed by releasing a substance called Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGFb). The investigators want to see if special white blood cells (called T cells) that have been given a gene that they hope will let them survive against TGFb and that have been trained to kill EBV infected cells can also survive in the blood and kill the tumor.

Investigators have used this sort of therapy with specially trained T cells to treat a different type of cancer that occurs after bone marrow and solid organ transplant called post transplant lymphoma. In this type of cancer they were able to successfully prevent and treat post transplant lymphoma. However when they used a similar approach in HD some patients had a partial response to this therapy, but no patients had a complete response. In a follow-up study they tried to find out if they could improve this treatment by growing T cells that recognize 2 of the proteins expressed on Lymphoma cells called LMP-1 and LMP2a. These special T cells were called LMP-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). Although some patients had tumor responses, CTL therapy alone did not cure those who had a lot of disease. Investigators think that a reason for this is that the tumor cells are releasing TGFb. For this reason, they want to find out if they can make the CTL resistant to TGFb by putting in a new gene called TGFb resistance gene. Investigators hope that this will improve this treatment for relapsed lymphoma. These TGFb-resistant LMP-specific CTLs are an investigational product not approved by FDA.

The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of TGFb resistant LMP-specific CTLs, to learn what the side effects are and to see whether this therapy might help patients with Lymphoma.","2031-07-31"

Vorinostat may also help carboplatin and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drugs. Giving chemotherapy with or without vorinostat before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

Because there is no standard treatment for the patients cancer at this time or because the currently used treatments do not work fully in all cases, patients are being asked to volunteer to take part in a gene transfer research study using special immune cells. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from diseases caused by germs or toxic substances. They work by binding those germs or substances, which stops them from growing or exerting their toxic effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected with germs. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers: they both have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. We have found from previous research that we can put a new gene into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. We now want to see if we can put a new gene in these cells that will let the T cells recognize and kill sarcoma cells. The new gene that we will put in makes an antibody specific for HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) that binds to sarcoma cells. In addition it contains CD28, which stimulated T cells and make them last longer. In other clinical studies using T cells, some investigators found that giving chemotherapy before the T cell infusion can improve the amount of time the T cells stay in the body and therefore the effect the T cells can have. Giving chemotherapy before a T cell infusion is called lymphodepletion since the chemotherapy is specifically chosen to decrease the number of lymphocytes in the body. Decreasing the number of patient's lymphocytes first should allow the T cells we infuse to expand and stay longer in your body, and potentially kill cancer cells more effectively. We will use fludarabine or the combination of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine as the chemotherapy agents for lymphodepletion. Cyclophosphamide and fludarabine are the chemotherapy agents most commonly used for lymphodepletion in immunotherapy clinical trials. The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of chimeric T cells, and to see whether this therapy might help patients with sarcoma. Another purpose is to see if it is safe to give HER2-CD28 T cells after lymphodepleting chemotherapy.","2032-07-31"

"NCT00979212","Lung Cancer","Procedure","surgery","Completed","United States","Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy With or Without Panitumumab in Treating Patients With Stage IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy (CT), such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving these treatments before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy and radiation therapy are more effective when given with or without panitumumab in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

Vagifem is an estrogen product. It is a tiny tablet that is inserted into the vagina. It relieves vaginal dryness. Women who have had breast cancer are usually told not to take estrogen. This is because estrogen use can lead to a breast cancer recurrence or a new primary breast cancer. It is unclear if the estrogen in Vagifem is only absorbed in the vagina. It may be absorbed into the blood stream for a short time and may cause a brief rise in your estrogen level. However, there is no clear evidence that this would cause any bad effects in patients with breast cancer. How much, if any, of these topical estrogens are absorbed through the vagina is not known. We also do not know what the impact is of low dose estrogen absorption on breast cancer outcomes. Also, the absorption should decrease as the mucus membranes are restored after estrogen exposure.","2023-09-30"

"NCT00999804","Breast Cancer","Drug","Lapatinib","Active, not recruiting","United States","Extension Study of Lapatinib Plus Herceptin With or Without Endocrine Therapy","Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in the U.S. Targeted therapies such as tamoxifen have been revolutionary in reducing tumor recurrences and mortality in early breast cancer. Using this successful paradigm, there has been a continued search for other targeted biologic therapies directed at receptors with known potential for promoting tumor growth.

The estrogen receptor (ER) and/or the HER signaling pathways are the dominant drivers of cell proliferation and survival in the majority of human breast cancers. Molecular targets of these pathways provide the most effective therapies in appropriately selected patients. However, de novo and acquired resistance remain major obstacles to successful treatment, and understanding the molecular pathways responsible for this resistance would enable the discovery of new strategies to overcome it.

The superiority of multi-drug HER2-targeted therapy over single agent therapy has been demonstrated in the preclinical setting using mouse xenografts. Trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib, and gefitinib, represent a group of therapeutic agents that target the HER family by different molecular mechanisms. Used as single agents in the MCF7/HER2-18 xenograft model, these drugs restored or enhanced sensitivity to tamoxifen. However, tumor growth inhibition lasted only 2-3 months before resistance to treatments occurred. However, when gefitinib, a HER1 inhibitor, was added to the two-antibody (T+P) regimen to block signals from HER1 dimers, a complete disappearance of nearly all xenograft tumors was observed; moreover, there was evidence of complete tumor eradication in 50% of the mice. The combination of lapatinib + trastuzumab was also highly effective in eradication of tumor burden, with no evidence of re-growth after 200 days. These xenograft models demonstrate that multi-drug HER2-targeted therapy more effectively induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation, thereby resulting in tumor regression. Furthermore, HER2 combination therapy appears to more effectively reduce levels of phosphorylated pAKT and MAPK, thus resulting in sustained tumor inhibition.","2024-01-31"

ABT-888 works by obstructing a DNA enzyme called poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) which helps repair cancer cells damaged by chemotherapy. By blocking the PARP enzyme, the cancer cells are unable to repair themselves and as a result die. The other drug in this study is temozolomide. Temozolomide is designed to damage DNA in order to prevent cancer cells from reproducing. Because PARP inhibitors, such as ABT-888, prevent cancer cells from repairing their own DNA, they enhance the potential of chemotherapy therapy like temozolomide to induce cell death. The combination of ABT-888 and temozolomide has been used in a clinical trial for treatment of other cancers and information for this research study suggests that the combination may help to inhibit growth in breast cancer.

Researchers will evaluate and compare predictors of health-related quality of life (QOL) among colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors who have Lynch syndrome (LS) with those patients who have sporadic CRC using both quantitative and qualitative methodology.

a. In both CRC groups, researchers will evaluate cancer preventive and health behaviors, including lifestyle factors and screening, psychosocial factors, including mood, family functioning, coping style, anxiety, depression, and social resources, and health care system factors, including interactions with health care providers and service utilization.

Researchers will compare the experience of first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients who have LS with that of FDRs of patients who have sporadic CRC using both quantitative and qualitative methodology.

a. Researchers will evaluate all of the domains listed above, as well as anticipatory grief, assessment of caregiving responsibilities, and fear of cancer in FDRs of patients with LS-related and sporadic CRC.

Researchers will examine CRC patients from both groups and their FDRs using dyadic analyses in order to evaluate the similarities and differences in their survivorship experience.
Researchers will evaluate the preventive and health behavior of patients who are non-conclusive for Lynch syndrome and their family members. They will examine their screening behavior and will explore how the interaction between the patients and their relatives affects the relatives' screening behavior.

They have not been approved in the combination for multiple myeloma or any other type of cancer. Bortezomib is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide is approved for use with dexamethasone for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy and for the treatment of certain types of myelodysplastic syndrome (another type of cancer affecting the blood). Dexamethasone is commonly used, either alone, or in combination with other drugs, to treat multiple myeloma. Please note that Bortezomib and Lenalidomide are provided to patients participating in this trial at no charge. Melphalan and cyclophosphamide, the drugs used during stem cell collection and transplant, are also approved by the FDA. Melphalan is an FDA-approved chemotherapy for multiple myeloma and is used as a high-dose conditioning treatment prior to stem cell transplantation. Cyclophosphamide is used, either alone, or in combination with other drugs, to treat multiple myeloma. These drugs have been used in other multiple myeloma studies and information from those studies suggests that this combination of therapy may help to treat newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

In this research study, we are looking to explore the drug combination, lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone alone or when combined with autologous stem cell transplantation to see what side effects it may have and how well it works for treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Specifically, the objective of this trial is to determine if, in the era of novel drugs, high dose therapy (HDT) is still necessary in the initial management of multiple myeloma in younger patients. In this study, HDT as compared to conventional dose treatment would be considered superior if it significantly prolongs progression-free survival by at least 9 months or more, recognizing that particular subgroups may benefit more compared to others.","2024-09-30"

Some of these patients show signs of virus that is called Epstein Barr virus (EBV) that causes mononucleosis or glandular fever (""mono"" or the ""kissing disease"") before or at the time of their diagnosis. EBV is found in the cancer cells of up to half the patients with HD and NHL, suggesting that it may play a role in causing Lymphoma. The cancer cells and some immune system cells infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system and escape destruction. We want to see if special white blood cells, called GRALE T cells, that have been trained to kill EBV infected cells can survive in the blood and affect the tumor.

We have used this sort of therapy to treat a different type of cancer called post transplant lymphoma. In this type of cancer the tumor cells have 9 proteins made by EBV on their surface. We grew T cells in the lab that recognized all 9 proteins and were able to successfully prevent and treat post transplant lymphoma. However, in HD and NHL, T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease, and CAEBV, the tumor cells and B cells only express 4 EBV proteins. In a previous study, we made T cells that recognized all 9 proteins and gave them to patients with HD. Some patients had a partial response to this therapy but no patients had a complete response. We then did follow up studies where we made T cells that recognized the 2 EBV proteins seen in patients with lymphoma, T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease and CAEBV. We have treated over 50 people on those studies. About 60% of those patients who had disease at the time they got the cells had responses including some patients with complete responses. This study will expand on those results and we will try and make the T cells in the lab in a simpler faster way. These cells are called GRALE T cells. These GRALE T cells are an investigational product not approved by the FDA.

The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of LMP-specific cytotoxic GRALE T cells created using this new manufacturing technique. We will learn what the side effects are and to see whether this therapy might help patients with HD or NHL or EBV associated T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease or CAEBV.","2025-07-31"

Multiple myeloma is a blood cancer that affects the plasma cells. These cells help produce antibodies and fight infection. Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is a related condition that may develop into multiple myeloma. The current standard of care for SMM is close follow-up without treatment until multiple myeloma develops. However, researchers are studying possible treatments for SMM itself.

Lenalidomide is a drug that may help reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Dexamethasone is a steroid that is often given with other anti-cancer drugs. These two drugs are an approved treatment for multiple myeloma that has not responded to at least one other treatment. Carfilzomib is an experimental drug that has been effective in treating multiple myeloma. Researchers want to combine these three drugs to see if they are a safe and effective treatment for SMM.

Objectives:

- To see if carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone are a safe and effective treatment for smoldering multiple myeloma.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have SMM that is likely to progress to multiple myeloma.

Design:

Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also have blood and urine tests, and baseline bone marrow scans. Bone marrow samples will also be collected.
Participants will have eight 28-day cycles of treatment with the three study drugs. The drugs will be given as tablets or as infusions. Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and study visits.

This Phase II trial is the first prospective study conducted to determine the treatment outcome and toxicity of IMRT or proton in the treatment of sinonasal cancer.

IMRT and proton radiation therapy are the two most established and most commonly employed advanced radiotherapy techniques for the treatment of sinonasal cancer. It is highly controversial whether one is superior to the other in terms of local control and toxicity outcome. It is also not clear if a subset of patients would benefit more from one treatment technology versus the other.

Due to the rarity and heterogeneity of sinonasal malignancies and the fact that proton beam is only available at a few centers in the United States, it is not feasible at present to do a Phase III study randomizing patients between IMRT and proton radiation therapy. In this study, a planned secondary analysis will be performed, comparing the treatment and toxicity outcome between IMRT and proton. The data on the IMRT and proton comparison from this trial will be used to design future multi-center prospective trials and to determine if randomized trial is necessary.

In this study, the treatment technique employed for an individual case will not be determined by the treating physician(s), but rather by the most advanced technology available at the treating institution for the treatment of the sinonasal cancer. At the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), proton beam therapy will be used for patients who meet the eligibility criteria. For institutions where protons are not available or institutions where the proton planning systems have not been optimized, IMRT exclusively will be used for the treatment of sinonasal cancer. Patient and tumor characteristics are expected to be comparable between IMRT- and proton- institutions","2024-07-31"

Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving lenalidomide with ipilimumab may be a better treatment for hematologic or lymphoid malignancies.","2025-03-31"

AIs are drugs that stop female hormone production. This hormone production mostly happens in fat, muscle, and breast tissue in postmenopausal women. The female hormone estrogen is an important hormone for the growth of breast cancer cells. Anastrozole (Arimidex®) and Letrozole (Femara®) are AIs that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They have been used since 2005 to treat women with early stage breast cancer.

When given before surgery (neoadjuvant), both anastrozole and letrozole have been shown to successfully shrink breast cancer tumors in most patients. In over 50% of patients, anastrozole and letrozole when given for about 4 months also helped to improve surgery outcomes. On top of that, whether or not a patient responds to anastrozole and letrozole before surgery can help the doctor decide whether that patient needs additional chemotherapy.

One of the things may influence the level of hormone is body weight. It has been previously shown that postmenopausal women with higher body fat have higher level of female hormone as well as an increased risk of breast cancer. This is likely due to an increase in aromatase activity in the fatty tissue. However, at the current time AIs are used at the same doses in all women with breast cancer no matter whether they have different body weight. Currently, we do not know for certain whether the same doses of AIs work as well in patients with higher body fat compared to patients with less body fat.

The purpose of this study is to see if women with higher body fat respond differently to AI treatment compared to women with lower body fat.","2025-03-20"

The overall objective is to use [18F]Flutemetamol, FDG-PET, and MRI to better understand CICI, which effects up to 16 -50% of individuals receiving long-term adjuvant chemotherapy.2,3 To date there have been few studies examining this problem using multi-modality imaging techniques to better understand this complex and significant problem.

FDG-PET and MRI are routinely used in clinical practice for the evaluation of cognitive dysfunction in older populations complaining of memory dysfunction. It is well recognized that FDG-PET can assist with the differentiation and characterization of various cognitive disorders due to unique patterns of cerebral metabolism caused by various cognitive and dementia-causing disorders.4-6 FDG-PET has been studied extensively in dementia research and has a high reliability in detecting Alzheimers disease (AD) many years before it can be diagnosed reliably using clinical criteria.4

To the investigators knowledge, there has been only a single small study using FDG-PET and bolus water activation paradigms in cancer patients complaining of memory problems.7 To date, there have been no studies using [18F]Flutemetamol as a PET imaging agent to assess the possibility of increased amyloid plaque burden as a potential contributing factor to the cognitive deficits and complaints seen in patients experiencing CICI. The novel feature of this project is in the combined use of [18F]Flutemetamol-PET, FDG-PET, and anatomic MRI to study a poorly understood but common problem: cognitive impairment in breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy.

If [18F]Flutemetamol, FDG-PET, and MRI can provide information on the pathophysiology of this disorder, it will be an important step in better understanding the etiology of this phenomenon and possibly other conditions resulting in cognitive dysfunction. These imaging assessments will make it possible to explore any altered changes in cerebral structure, metabolism, and amyloid deposition that may be responsible for CICI. This may help to predict which individuals may be affected by this problem and provide information for eventual therapeutic strategies to treat this common cancer-associated disorder.

This study will use [18F]Flutemetamol and FDG-PET imaging to assess and quantify the amyloid plaque burden and cerebral glucose metabolism, respectively, in breast cancer patients suffering from CICI and correlate those findings with structural changes on MRI. The [18F]Flutemetamol and FDG-PET scans of these study patients will then be compared to two GE software databases (CortexID-FDG and CortexID-Flutemetamol) which contain scan data from healthy control individuals to evaluate for abnormalities in cerebral glucose metabolism and amyloid plaque burden differing from the values expected for individuals in their age range.","2023-01-31"

To the investigators knowledge, there has been only a single small study using FDG-PET and bolus water activation paradigms in cancer patients complaining of memory problems.7 To date, there have been no studies using [18F]Flutemetamol as a PET imaging agent to assess the possibility of increased amyloid plaque burden as a potential contributing factor to the cognitive deficits and complaints seen in patients experiencing CICI. The novel feature of this project is in the combined use of [18F]Flutemetamol-PET, FDG-PET, and anatomic MRI to study a poorly understood but common problem: cognitive impairment in breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy.

If [18F]Flutemetamol, FDG-PET, and MRI can provide information on the pathophysiology of this disorder, it will be an important step in better understanding the etiology of this phenomenon and possibly other conditions resulting in cognitive dysfunction. These imaging assessments will make it possible to explore any altered changes in cerebral structure, metabolism, and amyloid deposition that may be responsible for CICI. This may help to predict which individuals may be affected by this problem and provide information for eventual therapeutic strategies to treat this common cancer-associated disorder.

This study will use [18F]Flutemetamol and FDG-PET imaging to assess and quantify the amyloid plaque burden and cerebral glucose metabolism, respectively, in breast cancer patients suffering from CICI and correlate those findings with structural changes on MRI. The [18F]Flutemetamol and FDG-PET scans of these study patients will then be compared to two GE software databases (CortexID-FDG and CortexID-Flutemetamol) which contain scan data from healthy control individuals to evaluate for abnormalities in cerebral glucose metabolism and amyloid plaque burden differing from the values expected for individuals in their age range.","2023-01-31"
